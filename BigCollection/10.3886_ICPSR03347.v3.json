Bush's performance as president, energy shortages and conservation, and the investigation into congressional intern Chandra Levy's disappearance. Respondents gave approval ratings of George W. Bush as president, Gray Davis as governor of California, and Gary Condit as United States Representative. Regarding recent energy shortages, respondents stated whether the government should give priority to increasing production of fuels or to encouraging energy conservation. They were asked to assign blame for the California energy shortages and to indicate whether they thought there was a real energy shortage or whether it was a ploy. Respondents gave their opinion on how President Bush and Governor Davis were handling the California energy shortage and commented on when they thought the energy problems would be over, whether they had cut back on their use of electricity, and if so, how. Respondents stated whether they believed public officials should be held to a higher standard in their personal lives, how closely they had been following the news about the disappearance of Chandra Levy, and whether they thought the situation had interfered with Representative Condit's job performance. They were asked whether they were registered to vote, whether they voted for Gary Condit in 2000, and whether they would vote to re-elect Condit. Respondents gave their opinions on whether Condit should resign from office, how much his moral values mattered to respondents in evaluating his job performance, whether Condit had hurt the investigation into Levy's disappearance, whether he had told the police everything, and whether respondents minded that Condit had misled the public about his relationship with Levy. In addition, respondents expressed their views on whether Condit asked Anne Marie Smith to lie about their relationship, whether Condit had anything to do with Levy's disappearance, whether the news media had acted responsibly in coverage of Levy's disappearance, and what proportion of Congress respondents believed had extramarital affairs. Background information on respondents includes gender, age, race, income, political leanings, religion, marital status, and education."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Condit, Gary"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Davis, Gray"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"energy conservation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"energy shortages"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Levy, Chandra"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public approval"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public figures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
