Respondents were asked a series  of questions relating to their attitudes toward their place of  residence. They were asked how long they had lived at their current  place of residence, what was the best thing about living there, and  what changes they would make. Respondents were asked more specific  questions about their immediate community and neighborhood such as  whether they felt safe walking around during the day and at night,  whether there were job opportunities, and how they perceived race  relations and living conditions in their community. They were asked  whether or not people in their community shared similar values as well  as what sorts of attitudes people in their community had. For example,  respondents were asked whether there was a sense of belonging, hope,  worry, pride, anger, or boredom among members of their community. They  were also asked about the importance of feeling like a member of a  community and about their personal relationships with fellow  neighbors. Other questions concerned their involvement in public  affairs, from what sources they received their news, whether or not  they trusted those news sources, and with what frequency they read the  newspaper. Respondents were asked if they felt the government had the  greatest responsibility in caring for citizens and whether the  government cared more about individuals or larger interests.  Respondents were also asked about their social activism such as  volunteer work, donating blood, and attending government meetings.  Other questions asked about their voting history, as well as their  involvement with local church, sports, civic, and fraternal  organizations. Respondents were asked about their geographic location  including state, county, and town, whether their place of residence  was considered urban or rural, and whether or not they lived near an  Indian reservation. The survey also collected general information on  the respondents such as gender, education, marital status, employment status, and income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizenship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"communities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community

Since no one source provided  all the weighting data required, two data sources were consulted in  the calculation of the weights. Data on household size were taken from  the 2000 United States Census (table available in Summary File 1 at  http://www.census.gov).

For these cases, the available data were multiplied and  substituted for the zero value used in the first missing data  strategy. Of the three remaining cases, two had data for one of the  three weighting variables.
