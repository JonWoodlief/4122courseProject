Topics covered include the national economy, the income tax system, relations with the Soviet Union and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Israel's handling of Palestinian protest on the West Bank, attention of the government to the needs of blacks, problems facing the country such as unemployment and hunger, and whether Reagan should use horoscopes or astrology to help him make government policy decisions. In addition, respondents were queried about their views on the candidates for the 1988 presidential election. Questions asked of respondents include whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the various presidential candidates, whom th\neir party should nominate for president, the amount of influence Jesse Jackson had on the Democratic party, whether George Bush was hiding something the public ought to know about concerning the Iran-Contra affair, whether Bush and Dukakis were tough enough to make the hard choices required of the president, and which candidate cared most about the needs of people like the respondent.
