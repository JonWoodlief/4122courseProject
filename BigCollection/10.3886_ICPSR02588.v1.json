Data were collected to explore topics such as the nature of individual  offending behavior, including offense mix and specialization, the  frequency of offending, and the characterization of offender types. To  address these issues, the post-release arrest patterns of two cohorts  of male youths paroled by the California Youth Authority in 1981-1982  and 1986-1987 were examined. The project focused on modeling the  frequency of recidivism and the correlates of arrest frequency. The  frequency of arrest was measured during two periods: the first year  following release and years two and three following release. Criminal  justice variables in this collection provide information on  county-level crime and clearance rates for violent and property crimes  known to the police. Measures of parolees' criminal history include  length of incarceration prior to current commitment, frequency of  arrest, age at first arrest, and calculated criminal history  scores. Personal and family characteristics include previous violent  behavior, alcohol and drug abuse, family violence, neglect or abuse,  degree of parental supervision, parental criminality, education, and  school disciplinary problems. Demographic variables include age and race of the subjects."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Much attention has been devoted to developing  appropriate analytical models of criminal careers. However, much less  attention has been given to studies of the nature of offending  behavior, especially among active offenders. Greater knowledge about  the patterns of criminal behavior might lead to new insights about the  appropriate specification of theoretical models. This study sought to  address topics that had been largely ignored in previous research,  such as the nature of individual offending behavior, including offense  mix and specialization, the frequency of offending, and the  characterization of offender types. These issues were addressed in  this data collection by examining the post-release arrest patterns of  two cohorts of young male parolees released from the California Youth  Authority in 1981-1982 and 1986-1987. Specifically, the study focused  on modeling the frequency of arrest and the correlates of arrest  frequency. The study did not model the entire criminal career from  onset to termination. Instead, the more limited objective was to model the arrest frequency over\na relatively limited time interval."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Random samples were drawn from two cohorts --  those paroled between July 1, 1981, and June 30, 1982, and those  paroled between July 1, 1986, and June 30, 1987. Data were collected  on these subjects from the administrative records of the California  Youth Authority and from police records. The dependent variables were  the number of arrests accumulated during the first year following  release and the number of arrests accumulated during the second and  third years following release, correcting for time free.
