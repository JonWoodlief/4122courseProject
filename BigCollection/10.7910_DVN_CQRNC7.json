The main objective of this program was to encourage families to adopt and consistently practice five health behaviors which are critical for preventing under-five mortality: sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN), utilization of oral rehydration solution (ORS) for the treatment of diarrhea, hand-washing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding and delivery with a skilled birth attendant. The C4D intervention package tried to achieve behavioral change through four main activities: (1) Home visits and counseling by Community-Based Agents (CBAs) affiliated with GHS; (2) Ghana Community Radio Network (GCRN) community radio broadcasts of focus group discussions and jingles; (3) Theatre dramas supported by the Center for National Culture (CNC); and (4) Video screening of recorded drama supported by the CNC. Additionally, a mobile messaging intervention (Mobile for development or M4D) was developed to complement the ongoing C4D activities. The M4D program targeted the same behaviors as the C4D program. Rather than relying on home visits, drama or radio programming, the program relied on voice messages directly delivered to female respondents through their cell phones. The main objective of this evaluation was to determine the impact of the C4D and M4D programs on the practice of the five key behaviors mentioned above. In order to allow for a rigorous evaluation of these programs, the C4D program was randomly rolled out at the community level, while the M4D program was randomized at the individual level. To capture changes in behavior, three survey rounds were conducted: A baseline survey in 2012, a midline survey in 2014 and an endline survey in 2016. Two round of qualitative data collection were also conducted to complement and explain the findings of the quantitative analysis."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Communicable diseases"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Diarrhea"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Malaria"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Digital and mobile"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Early childhood development"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health care delivery"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Preventive health"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Water"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sanitation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hygiene"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"VOTO Mobile"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Research Support, Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-12-06"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stata"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"13"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Ghana"},"state":{"typeName":"state","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Twelve  districts  of  the  four  poorest  regions  of  Ghana:  Central,  Upper  East,  Upper  West  and Northern  Region"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Household, individual, and community"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Children under age 5"]},{"typeName":"dataCollector","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"C4D Intervention - Community Level Randomization: For the C4D evaluation, 216 communities were randomly selected from a comprehensive list of communities within each district provided by GHS. Of them, 108 (50%) were randomly selected as control areas and 108 (50%) as treatment areas. In order to be able to identify the most effective interventions, the 108 communities selected for treatment received various combinations of behavior change interventions. All treated communities received CBA training and either live drama/theater (50%) or video screenings (50%). In addition, 50% of communities also received interactive community radio programming. This design was used to measure the additional effect of local radio programming on individuals’ health knowledge and behaviors compared to community dramas and household visits by CBAs alone. Randomization was done in Stata by the Principal Investigators. Communities in the control group were not actively made aware of the C4D interventions conducted in the treatment communities.\r\n\r\nC4D Intervention - Household and Individual Level Selection: Following the community selection, a household census was conducted by IPA. From each of the 216 communities, a random sample of, on average, 20 households with at least one child under the age of five were enrolled at baseline in 2012, and followed up through a midline survey in 2014 and an endline survey in 2016.\r\n\r\nM4D Intervention: The sampling frame for the M4D intervention was households interviewed at baseline with access to a functioning cell phone. Randomization was done at the household level, regardless of the C4D treatment or control status: households were randomized with equal probability to control (1/3), single voice messaging (1/3) and multiple voice messaging (1/3). The randomization code was programmed using a statistical analysis software and performed by the Principal Investigators and IPA. It was not performed publicly and the respondents from the control group were not actively made aware of the M4D intervention."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In-person interviews"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This folder contains all of the files necessary to conduct analysis for this project.","label":"C4D Dataverse Files.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":140013,"dataFile":{"id":3199574,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CQRNC7/RC7DT0","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CQRNC7/RC7DT0","filename":"C4D Dataverse Files.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":24150455,"description":"This folder contains all of the files necessary to conduct analysis for this project.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:164f1281bbf-80ea721c4fa2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"04292a7f034a770de472b6830fc254db","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"04292a7f034a770de472b6830fc254db"}}},{"description":"This folder contains the do files necessary to conduct analysis for this project.","label":"code.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":140013,"dataFile":{"id":3199237,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CQRNC7/VRDFXQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CQRNC7/VRDFXQ","filename":"code.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":22096,"description":"This folder contains the do files necessary to conduct analysis for this project.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:164f0ba5465-51fee2c33a4d","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"056e6117d6e8c78647e60553c7d25263","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"056e6117d6e8c78647e60553c7d25263"}}},{"description":"This folder contains the data files necessary to conduct analysis for this project.","label":"data.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":140013,"dataFile":{"id":3199238,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CQRNC7/LQKNYN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CQRNC7/LQKNYN","filename":"data.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":24126875,"description":"This folder contains the data files necessary to conduct analysis for this project.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:164f1127f92-03e1987360dd","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e03159cdfec3ab5ff5d550f806545e1d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e03159cdfec3ab5ff5d550f806545e1d"}}}]}}}
