As a result, the role of opposition parties is not always clear. In this chapter, therefore, we evaluate coalition politics in Latin America to first analyze the presidents’ legislative support. We then consider the role of the opposition in lawmaking and oversight of the executive. The data suggests several conclusions. First, coalition politics in Latin America historically reduced the risk of military interventions. Second, though the opposition participates in the elaboration of laws, legislators tend to define their distinctive role as oversight, up to and including measures that force the removal of the president from office."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Latin America"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Presidents"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Morgenstern, Scott, Juan Javier Negri, and Aníbal Pérez-Liñán.  2008.  “Parliamentary Opposition in Non-Parliamentary Regimes: Latin America.”  Journal of Legislative Studies 14 (1): 160-189."}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Murray Research Archive"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/logos/10/mra_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-04-04"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1978"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Cross-section, and Cross-Section Time-Series"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Latin America"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Presidential administrations"]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Latin American presidents, 1978-2006"]}]},"customMRA":{"displayName":"MRA Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"mraCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Politics and Government"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Administration-level data for Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 5 (SPSS)","label":"JLS2008a.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":134213,"categories":["Data files"],"dataFile":{"id":1546252,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"JLS2008a.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":24513,"description":"Administration-level data for Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 5 (SPSS)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:55018","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:f4Vq6T5oQCy2fv4nqMcoCQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ad2d83caf033799883a5d24cb9158e59","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ad2d83caf033799883a5d24cb9158e59"}}},{"description":"Stata do-file for Table 6 and Table 7 (for use with JLS2008b)","label":"JLS2008b.do","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":134213,"categories":["Replication"],"dataFile":{"id":1546256,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"JLS2008b.do","contentType":"text/x-stata-syntax; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":580,"description":"Stata do-file for Table 6 and Table 7 (for use with JLS2008b)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:55023","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"eae3ad1b1465f864fb9307d93622b195","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"eae3ad1b1465f864fb9307d93622b195"}}},{"description":"Administration-year data for Tables 6 and 7","label":"JLS2008b.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":134213,"categories":["Data files"],"dataFile":{"id":1546257,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"JLS2008b.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":35384,"description":"Administration-year data for Tables 6 and 7","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:55025","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:p4cuCxHZ7SMHL9aBdcqEiQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"bd7edcc1e64b6247b2d06790d5902902","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"bd7edcc1e64b6247b2d06790d5902902"}}}]}}}
