This survey, fielded August 6, 1998 is a  call-back of the July 28-30, 1998, cohort (CBS NEWS MONTHLY POLL #2,  JULY 1998 [ICPSR 2602]). Respondents were asked to give their opinions  of President Bill Clinton, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, and  former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Those queried were also  asked to assess the importance of the allegation that Clinton had an  affair with Lewinsky and encouraged her to lie about it under  oath. Additional topics covered who was to blame for Clinton's current  situation, the Starr investigation, whether the public needed to know  about the Clinton-Lewinsky matter, the upcoming August 1998 testimony  of Clinton in front of a grand jury, and whether Clinton would testify  truthfully. A final question addressed the reliability of DNA tests.  Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race,  ethnicity, political party, political orientation, marital status, education, family income, and age of children in household."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
