These surveys regularly monitor public opinion in the European Union (EU) member countries and consist of standard modules and special topic modules. The standard modules address attitudes towards European unification, institutions and policies, measurements for general socio-political orientations, as well as respondent and household demographics. The special topic modules address such topics as agriculture, education, natural environment and resources, public health, public safety and crime, and science and technology.</p>\n\n<p>This round of Eurobarometer surveys covers the following special topics: (1) E-Communications, and (2) Corruption. In regard to the E-Communications, respondents were queried about goods they own such as television, music player, DVD player, computer, household and mobile telephone. They were also asked about internet access and its use for phone calls, quality of their mobile network service as well as the cost and utility. In regard to corruption, respondents were asked if they were required to make an extra payment, gift or donation to a hospital or hospital staff for care. Opinions were collected on the degree of acceptable gift giving, scope of corruption in the country, change in corruption over the last three years, which groups are involved in widespread corruption and knowledge of case corruption and bribes for services.</p>\n\n<p>Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.
