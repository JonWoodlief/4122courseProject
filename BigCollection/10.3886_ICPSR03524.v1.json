The file is sorted within state in  ascending sequence of 5-digit school district codes. Where school  districts cross county lines, school district total and county  component records appear separately. In these cases, the school  district total record precedes its county component records, which are  sorted by 1970 FIPS county code. School districts with populations of  less than 1,000 persons are combined in the code category 99999.
