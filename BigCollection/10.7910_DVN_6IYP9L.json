Antiglobalization forces and environmentalists\r\nview these developments as a threat to the welfare of future generations\r\nbecause of profligate and excessive current consumption. This study is the first to\r\nestimate the effects of dependence on trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and an\r\nindex of economic freedom on the World Bank’s measure of sustainability - the genuine\r\nsavings rate -  which measures the rate at which investment in the total stock of\r\nmanufactured, human, and natural capital exceeds its depreciation. Contrary to pessimists’\r\nfears, our indicators of economic openness show positive effects on sustainability,\r\nresults that are robust to sample size, testing procedure, and several alternative\r\nspecifications. The results support those who suggest that distorted economies tend\r\nto be both inefficient and damaging to future generations. If increasing trade, FDI,\r\nand economic freedom are hallmarks of globalization, then worries about its effects\r\non future well-being are misplaced."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-31"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for International Organization.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":80699,"dataFile":{"id":2799342,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6IYP9L/3BUS04","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6IYP9L/3BUS04","filename":"Article for International Organization.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":9372,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153ce350f0d-f96fa1a063a1","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1149ca732a6309a115ed0868324ae303","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1149ca732a6309a115ed0868324ae303"}}},{"label":"Article for International Organization.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":80699,"dataFile":{"id":2799341,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6IYP9L/3PZKGX","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6IYP9L/3PZKGX","filename":"Article for International Organization.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3017996,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153ce3552c7-596765c76480","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:1X1dMyhSXET1ySpL+a8N0A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"503bf1e404d1a577c3a49d08635da9f2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"503bf1e404d1a577c3a49d08635da9f2"}}}]}}}
