This paper examines the propagation and the power loss in the SOL by using the full wave code AORSA, in which the edge plasma beyond the last closed flux surface (LCFS) is included in the solution domain and a collisional damping parameter is used as a proxy to represent the real, and most likely nonlinear, damping processes. 3D AORSA results for National Spherical Torus eXperiment (NSTX), where a full antenna spectrum is reconstructed, are shown confirming the same behavior found for a single toroidal mode results in Bertelli et al Nucl. Fusion, 54 083004, 2014, namely, a strong transition to higher SOL power losses (driven by the RF field) has been found when the FW cut-off is removed from in front of the antenna by increasing the edge density. Additionally, full wave simulations have been extended for “conventional” tokamaks with higher aspect ratios, such as the DIII-D, Alcator C-Mod, and EAST devices. DIII-D results show similar behavior found in NSTX and NSTX-U, consistent with previous DIII-D experimental observations. In contrast, a different behavior has been found for C-Mod and EAST, which operate in the minority heating regime unlike NSTX/NSTX-U and DIII-D, which operate in the mid/high harmonic regime."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alcator C-Mod"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer simulations"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ion cyclotron heating"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NSTX"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"scrape off layer"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/15ja/15ja086/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-15-86</a><br /><br />This work was supported in part under DoE Contract No. DE-FC02-01ER54648."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"15ja086_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149398,"dataFile":{"id":3342288,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"15ja086_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":930788,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168394db265-1cd84533ae42","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2a3c1aae9a8026533fbd184abe144d29","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2a3c1aae9a8026533fbd184abe144d29"}}}]}}}
