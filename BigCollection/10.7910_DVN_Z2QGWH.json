This is a market research firm \r which\nspecializes in providing newspapers, television affiliates and cable\noperators with market segmentation research pertinent to consumer purchasing \r patterns and the effective marketing of goods and services to program audiences. \r The data in the Stowell Archive were collected via random digit dialing and \r computer-aided telephone interviews (CATI). Most of the surveys focus on the \r marketing needs of mass media clients and contain demographics, psychographics, \r media exposure information, and purchasing behavior data about consumers in \r major metropolitan\nareas of the <st1:country-region w:st=\"on\">United States</st1:country-region> \r and <st1:country-region w:st=\"on\"><st1:place\r  w:st=\"on\">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> starting in 1989. The sample \r sizes of the surveys range from 500 to 3,000 respondents, averaging 1,000 \r observations per study. Data are available at the respondent level, and all \r observations are keyed to zip code or other geographic identifiers.
