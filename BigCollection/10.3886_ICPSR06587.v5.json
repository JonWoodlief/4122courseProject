It was accurately shown in the data definition statements as 9.4. Variables listed after WGHT were inaccurately reported one column off in the codebook. Similarly, column location (and width) of variable WGHT \"TOTAL WEIGHT\" was incorrectly shown as 10.2 for Part 2, Civil Jury Data. It was accurately shown in the data definition statements as 9.2.

The replicate weights were created by the jackknife method and the user must specify the JKN variance estimation procedure when using Wesvar PC. The JKN variance estimation procedure will not work correctly unless two files of factors are attached to each Wesvar file. Two sets of factor files are included in the study. To work with the Wesvar data file for Part 1 (Tort, Contract, and Real Property Rights Data), users should download da6587.p3 and da6587.p4, change the file names to fpcp1.txt and jknfp1.txt, and attach both files to the Wesvar data file. Similarly, to work with the Wesvar data file for Part 2 (Civil Jury Cases Data), users should download da6587.p5 and da6587.p6, change the file names to fpcp2.txt and jknfp2.txt, and attach both files to the Wesvar data file. In addition, the degrees of freedom should be set at 77 in Wesvar (119 replicate weights, 42 varstrat units) for Part 1 and at 24 (42 replicate weights, 18 varstrat units) for Part 2 in\norder to calculate the correct confidence intervals.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1996-10-01"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1991-07-01"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1992-06-30"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1992-10"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1994-09"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["event/transaction data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Civil Justice Survey of State Courts: [United States] Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["standard coding forms completed by court staff"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Forty-five jurisdictions chosen to represent the 75 most populous counties in the nation."]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The sample for this study was designed and selected by the  United States Bureau of the Census.
