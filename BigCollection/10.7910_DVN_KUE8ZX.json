The suggested inclusion of time interactions in our models is more than a statistical fix: These corrections alter the substantive meaning and interpretation of results. Framing the issue as a specific case of multiplicative-interaction modeling, I provide detailed discussion of the problem of NPHs and present several appropriate means of interpreting both the substantive impact and the significance of variables whose effects may change over time."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-03-10"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nonproportional hazards, interpretation, graphs"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Amanda A.

On a fast computer (quad-core running Stata 11-MC) it takes about ten minutes.  On a slower/older computer, it could take much longer than that (hours rather than minutes).  To run the file you will need to download all of the replication datasets available here.  Be sure to save them in the same directory, and then to change the <cd> line at the top of the do-file.  If you miss this step, Stata will look in the wrong place for the data files and will immediately stumble.  Running the do-file will result in a series of data files (containing the substantive interpretation variables and simulation output), as well as 9 graphs to be saved to your computer.  In all, these files will take up about 460MB of space.
