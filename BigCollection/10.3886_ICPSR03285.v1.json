Virginia residents were asked to give their opinions of  President George W. Bush, Virginia governor Jim Gilmore and his  handling of the governorship, Republican candidate Mark Earley,  Democratic candidate Mark Warner, and Virginia's Republican and  Democratic parties. Respondents were asked whether they were paying  attention to the campaign, whether they intended to vote in the  election, and for whom they would vote given a choice among Earley,  Warner, and Libertarian candidate William Redpath. Views were sought  on which candidate would work to hold taxes down, look out for the  interests of people like the respondent, strengthen the state's  economy, say anything to get elected, and improve transportation and  the roads, and which candidate was best qualified to be governor. A  series of questions addressed the campaign issues and the candidates'  positions on those issues, including the importance of education,  eliminating the Virginia state car tax, holding down taxes, improving  transportation and roads, improving public education, strengthening  the state economy, addressing gun control, and addressing  abortion. Respondents were asked whether they preferred a governor who  would move the state in a new direction or keep things the way they  were, was a successful businessman, had been endorsed by the National  Rifle Association (NRA), was willing to spend his own money on the  campaign, was strongly supported by conservative Christian groups,  and/or had experience as an elected official. Additional topics  covered whether northern Virginia residents had too much influence in  state politics, whether respondents were upset that the Virginia  legislature adjourned earlier in the year without passing a budget,  how increased numbers of immigrants had affected their community,  whether the administration of Standards of Learning (SOL) tests in  Virginia schools should continue, and whether the death penalty was  used fairly in Virginia. Background information on respondents  includes age, gender, political party, political orientation, voter  registration and participation history, employment status, marital  status, education, religion, military service, children in household,  average commute time, size of city of residence, household gun  ownership, Hispanic origin, household income, length of Virginia  residency, whether the respondent lived inside the \"Beltway,\" and  whether the respondent was employed by the \"dot.com\" (technology) industry."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"campaign issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gubernatorial elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun control"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun regulation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"taxes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
