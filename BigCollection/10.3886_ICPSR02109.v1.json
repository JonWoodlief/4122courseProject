Final edited data are on file for 2,959 reporting  units. Data for 370 of the non-respondents (Attachment A) were imputed  (estimated) using their HEGIS XIX data. (The data on revenues and  expenditures were inflated using the 1985 Higher Education Price  Index, while the remaining data were adjusted using national  averages). The remaining 50 non-respondents (Attachment B) were placed  on the Master File with zero-filled data in Part A, Line 01, since no  data were available for the previous year. One hundred sixty-three  responding systems or institutions submitted data for non-campus  entities or combined data and they are identified by a \"1\" entered in  record position 161 and by a \"3\" in positions 155-160. (2) The numeric  data fields (Position 83-148) are regular signed numeric fields. The  documentation states that the sign is in the first position for each  cell. In order to be able to read the data properly, users should  follow the following coding system: Letters A-I = 1 to 9 and are  considered positive numbers, Letters J-R = -1 to -9 and are considered  negative numbers, { = 0 and is considered a positive number, and } = 0 and is considered a negative number.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2004-10-29"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1985"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1985"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["self-enumerated questionnaires"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"American Samoa"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Guam"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Marshall Islands"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Puerto Rico"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Virgin Islands of the United States"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Global"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["All postsecondary institutions operating during 1985 in  the United States and its territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto  Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Marshall Islands) and Department of Defense schools outside of the United States."]},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) XX Financial Statistics of Institutions of Higher Education for Fiscal Year 1985  ","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35599,"dataFile":{"id":2613615,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) XX Financial Statistics of Institutions of Higher Education for Fiscal Year 1985  ","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
