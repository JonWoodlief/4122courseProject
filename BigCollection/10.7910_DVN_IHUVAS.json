The fact that genese within a pathway tend to interact with each other and relate to the outcome in a complicated way makes nonparametric methods more desirable.  The kernel machine method provides a convenient, powerful and unified method for multi-dimensional parametric and nonparametric modeling of the pathway effect.    RESULTS:  In this paper we propose a logistic kernel machine regression model for binary outcomes.  This model relates the disease risk to covariates parametrically and to genes within a genetic pathway parametrically or nonparametrically using kernel machines.  The nonparametric genetic pathway effect allows for possible interactions among the genes within the same pathway and a complicated relationship of the genetic pathway and the outcome.  We show that kernel machine estimation of the model components can be formulated using a logistic mixed model.  Estimation hence can proceed within a mixed model framework using standard statistical software.  A score test based on a Gaussian process approximation is developed to test for the genetic pathway effect.  The methods are illustrated using a prostate cancer data set and evaluated using simulations.  An extension to continuous and discrete outcomes using generalized kernel machine models and its connection with generalized linear mixed models is discussed."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Statistical Genetics, Genomics, and Omics"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-10-12"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"logistic_km.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54348,"dataFile":{"id":1581516,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"logistic_km.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":224421,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:61673","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a143adfb4bf1b59aebb0d4203f8ecd80","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a143adfb4bf1b59aebb0d4203f8ecd80"}}}]}}}
