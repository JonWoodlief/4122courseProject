In many parliamentary systems, the timing of the next election  is at the discretion of the current government. Rather than waiting for  the end of their term, leaders are free to call elections when it is  advantageous to them and when they expect to win. This project was  designed to use game theory to model how leaders decide whether to call  elections based on their expectations about future performance. The data  collected for this study reflect the timing of the British General  Elections. In particular, this study addressed five research questions:  (1) When are elections called? (2) What are the electoral implications  of the timing of an election? (3) How are election timing and subsequent  post-electoral economic performance related? (4) How does the election  timing affect the length of the campaign? and (5) How does the London  stock market respond to the announcement of elections? The data cover  the time span from 1900 to 2001, although most of the files focus on the  period from August 1, 1945, to June 13, 2001. Part 1 (Dates of Key  Political Events Data) contains the dates of key political events, such  as elections, first meetings of parliament, dissolutions, announcements  of an election, by-elections, shifts in party allegiances, confidence  votes, or changes in Prime Minister. Additional variables in Part 1  include whether there is a minority government or coalition government,  percentage share of the vote by party type, number of seats by party  type, and election turnout. Part 2 (By-Elections Data) includes the  change in seats as a result of by-elections. Variables include the date  of the by-election, electoral district, and change in seats by political  parties. Part 3 (Change in Party Allegiance Data) contains information  about the date of the allegiance shift, the electoral district, and  defections to and from various political parties. Part 4 (Public Opinion  Data) includes Gallup public opinion data on voting intentions, approval  of government record, and approval of Prime Minister and opposition  leader. Part 5 (Basic Economic Variables) contains basic economic data  for the United Kingdom, such as various measures of gross domestic  product and change in retail price index. Part 6 (Monthly Inflation  Data) contains monthly inflation data as measured by the percentage  change in retail price index. Part 7 (Unemployment Data) consists of  monthly, quarterly, and yearly unemployment data. Part 8 (Stock Market  Data) includes data on the United Kingdom market index, United States  Dow Jones industrial average, Standard and Poors' composite index, the  Financial Times 500 stock index, and Datastream's measure of British  funds on the London Exchange. Part 9 (Financial Times 30 Share Index  Data) contains the Financial Times 30 close and the volume of bargains.  Lastly, Part 10 (Newspaper Stories Data) consists of counts of newspaper stories relating to the next general election."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parliamentary elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"party change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political leaders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR VI.B.
