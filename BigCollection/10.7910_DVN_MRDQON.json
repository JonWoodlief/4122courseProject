Using a multiplicative specification, the authors find that PR and parliamentarism appear to exacer- bate political violence when ethnic fractionalization is high, though the effect of federalism is less certain."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consociationalism, majoritarianism, divided societies, proportional representation, presidentialism, parliamentarism, federalism"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Comparative Political Studies 2012 45: 1542"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.1177/0010414011425341"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://cps.sagepub.com/content/45/12/1542"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-11-26"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This is the correct version of the dataset.
