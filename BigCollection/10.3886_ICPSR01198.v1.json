Charts describing the 10-year  average growth rates in the M2 monetary aggregate, nominal GDP, real  GDP, and inflation are used to show that there is a consistent  longer-term correlation between M2 growth, nominal GDP growth, and  inflation but not between such nominal variables and real GDP  growth. The data reveal extremely long cycles in monetary growth and  inflation, the most recent of which was the strong upward trend in M2  growth, nominal GDP growth, and inflation during the 1960s and 1970s,  and the strong downward trend since then. Data going back to the 19th  century show that the most recent inflation/disinflation cycle is a  repetition of earlier long mone\ntary growth and inflation cycles in the  United States historical record. Also discussed is a measure of bond  market inflation credibility, defined as the difference between  averages in long-term bond rates and real GDP growth. By this measure,  inflation credibility hovered close to zero during the 1950s and early  1960s, but then rose to a peak of about 10 percent in the early  1980s. During the 1990s, the bond market has yet to restore the low  inflation credibility that existed before inflation turned up during  the 1960s. The conclusion is that the risks of starting another costly  inflation/disinflation cycle could be avoided by monitoring monetary  growth and maintaining a sufficiently tight policy to keep inflation  low. An environment of credible price stability would allow the  economy to function unfettered by inflationary distortions, which is  all that can reasonably be expected of monetary policy, and is precisely what should be expected."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic growth rate"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"historical data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"inflation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gross Domestic Product"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
