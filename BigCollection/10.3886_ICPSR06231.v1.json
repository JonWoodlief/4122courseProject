The Survey of American Indians and Alaska Natives   (SAIAN) was designed in collaboration with the Indian Health Service   (IHS), and used the same data collection instruments, interview   procedures, and time frame as the NMES Household Survey component.   However, the SAIAN differed from the Household Survey in several   respects. The SAIAN sample was interviewed only three times and was not   given the supplements on long-term care, caregiving, and   care-receiving. Also, SAIAN respondents were asked additional questions   on topics such as use of IHS facilities and traditional medicine, and   were given a modified self-administered questionnaire with separate   versions for adults and children. Interviewers for the SAIAN were   mainly American Indians or Alaska Natives, and about 20 percent of the   interviews were not conducted entirely in English. Of these,   approximately 40 percent were conducted entirely in the native language   of the respondent. Public Use Tape 20P contains detailed information on   eligibility status, interview dates, demographic characteristics (age,   marital status, military service, education, income), employment and   insurance, link variables, and other survey administration variables   for all persons in the sample.
