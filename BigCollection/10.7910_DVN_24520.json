Teqing was resistant to C2 and C4, but moderately susceptible to C5, whereas Lemont was susceptible to all three races. Highly significant correlations were detected among the resistance to different races at different developmental stages. A major gene (Xa4), 14 main-effect QTLs (M-QTLs), and 18 epistatic QTLs were identified in the two developmental stages over 2 years, and were largely responsible for the segregation of resistance in the ILs. In 2007, the Lemont alleles at all loci in the seedling stage, except QBbr10 to C4, increased lesion length (LL) or decreased resistance. The Teqing allele at the Xa4 locus acted as a resistance gene against C2 and C4, but acted as a M-QTL when its resistance was overcome by the virulent race C5. MQTLs showed a degree of race specificity and had a cumulative effect on resistance. Most M-QTLs (94%) consistently expressed resistance to the same race at the seedling and adult stages, indicating that a high degree of genetic overlap exists between Xoo resistance at both developmental stages in rice. Among the digenic interacti\r\nons, most co-introgressed Lemont alleles at the two epistatic loci lead to significantly smaller LL with all three races, compared to other types of interacting alleles at both development stages. The results indicate that a high level of resistance may be achieved by the cumulative effect of multiple M-QTLs, including the residual effects of \"defeated\" major resistance genes and the epistatic effects of co-introgression from diverse susceptible varieties."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Rice"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"QTL"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bacterial blight"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Overlap"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: null  Type: PBGB  Notes: ;"},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ministry of Agriculture of China"},"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"948 Program, 2011-G2B"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Journal of Plant Biology"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Botanical Society of Korea"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"J Plant Biol"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jean Sabado"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-01-27"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["screenhouse at the Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing"]}]}},"files":[]}}}
