This poll focuses on the opinions of 1,062 residents of the state of New York, including 931 registered voters. Respondents were asked for their opinions of David Patterson and whether they approved of the way he was handling his job as Governor of New York, and for their opinions of the New York State Legislature in Albany and public officials such as United States Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Nassau County Executive Thomas Suozzi, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, Speaker of the New York City Council Christine Quinn, United States Representative Anthony Weiner, and former New York City Major Rudolph Giuliani. Opinions were solicited on whether things in the state of New York and New York City were going in the right direction, the condition of the New York State economy, which of New York State's problems respondents wanted Governor Patterson to concentrate on the most, whether the State Senate and Assembly should be controlled by the same political party, whether respondents wanted to be living in the same place in four years, and whether the Bloomberg Administration had done enough to balance the need for more safety in the construction industry and the economic benefits of development. Respondents were asked how much attention they had been paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, which candidate they would vote for if the 2008 presidential election were being held that day, for their opinions of the 2008 presidential candidates and of former President Bill Clinton, whether Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was mostly positive, whether Hillary or Bill Clinton used race in an offensive way during the course of her presidential campaign, and which candidate they voted for in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Additional topics included corruption in New York State government, civil unions and New York State recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions, racial issues concerning police use of deadly force and the 2006 case of Sean Bell, respondents' financial situation, housing costs, term limits for city officials, and former Governor Eliot Spitzer's involvement as a client in a prostitution ring. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, education level, household income, marital status, r\neligious preference, frequency of religious attendance, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, the presence of children under 18 in the household, and what type of school respondents' children were enrolled in at that time (public or private)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bloomberg,
