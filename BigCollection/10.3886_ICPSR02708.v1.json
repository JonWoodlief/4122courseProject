Those queried  were asked whether they believed that Clinton should be impeached  and/or removed from office, and whether lying under oath regarding an  extramarital affair was serious enough to warrant being removed from  office. Respondents were asked for their views on Starr's claim that  Clinton lied under oath about his affair with former White House  intern Monica Lewinsky, and in doing so obstructed justice. A series  of questions addressed respondents' impressions of Starr, Starr's  handling of the charges against Clinton, and Starr's  motives. Respondents were asked for their opinions on the House  Judiciary Committee's decision to expand the impeachment hearings to  include charges that Clinton made unwanted sexual advances to former  White House volunteer Kathleen Willey as well as Clinton's role in  1996 presidential campaign f\nundraising activities. An additional  question sought respondents' views on the November 20, 1998,  resignation of Starr's ethics advisor, Sam Dash, who felt Starr's  investigation was no longer impartial. On another topic, those queried  were asked whether the United States should follow through with its  warning that it would bomb Iraq unless Iraq stopped interfering with  United Nations weapons inspection teams. A final question asked  respondents whom they would rather have as a guest to their  Thanksgiving dinner, Lewinsky or Starr. Background information on  respondents includes age, race, sex, education, political party, political orientation, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
