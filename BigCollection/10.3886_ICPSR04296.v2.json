Information on a variety of social and demographic topics was gathered  to historically characterize populations living in counties within the  United States Great Plains, in terms of: (1) urban, rural, and total  population, (2) vital statistics, (3) net migration, (4) age and sex,  (5) nativity and ancestry, (6) education and literacy, (7) religion,  (8) industry, and (9) housing and other characteristics. These data  include selected material compiled as part of the United States  population census. The United States Census of Population and Housing  has been conducted since 1790 on a regular schedule that is  decennial. The county-level social and demographic data produced by  the United States government as a result constitute a consistent  series of measures capturing changes in the United States population's  size, composition, and other characteristics. A subset of the  variables available from the short and long-form survey questionnaires  of the United States Census of Population and Housing (as compiled for  counties) were extracted from previously existing digital files.  Besides the decennial census of the population, county-level data were  drawn from an assortment of existing digital files as well as sources  that were manually digitized. Other data include compilations of  county-level information gathered from various federal agencies and  private organizations as well as the agriculture and economic  censuses. Supplementing these compilations are manu\nally digitized  consumer market data, religious data, and vital statistics, including information about births, deaths, marriage, and divorce.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"age"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"birth

With the universe of all persons and  housing units in the United States, the following summarizes the  sampling methodology used in the United States Population Census from  1870 to 2000 (United States Department of Commerce, April 2002):</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the 1870-1930 United States Censuses</strong></p>\n\n<p>No sampling information was available for the years 1870 to  1930. Data represent 100 percent counts of the United States  population.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the 1940 United States  Census</strong></p>\n\n<p>The person was the sampling unit in 1940. The  sample data collected information from 5 percent of the  population.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the 1950 United  States Census</strong></p>\n\n<p>The person was the  sampling unit in 1950. The sample data collected population and  housing information for 20 percent of the population.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the 1960 United States  Census</strong></p>\n\n<p>The sample data population  questions were asked of 25 percent of the population. For the housing  sample data, some questions were asked of 5 percent of the population,  some of 20 percent, and some of both (constituting a 25 percent sample  for those questions).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the  1970 United States Census</strong></p>\n\n<p>The housing  unit was the sampling unit. For the sample data, some questions were  asked of 5 percent of the population, some of 15 percent, and some of  both (constituting a 20 percent sample for those questions).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the 1980 United States  Census</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the STF3, one-half of all  housing units and persons in group quarters in incorporated places of  less than 2,500 persons we\nre included in the sample. In all other  places, one-sixth of the housing units or persons in group quarters  were sampled. When both sampling rates were taken into account,  approximately 19 percent of the nation's housing units were included  in the census sample.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the  1990 United States Census</strong></p>\n\n<p>A sample of  persons and housing units was asked more detailed questions about such  items as income, occupation, and housing costs in addition to the  basic demographic and housing information. The primary sampling unit  for the 1990 census was the housing unit, including all occupants. For  persons living in group quarters, the sampling unit was the  person. Housing units in governmental units with a precensus (1988)  estimated population of fewer than 2,500 persons were sampled at  1-in-2. Housing units in census tracts and block numbering areas  (BNAs) with a precensus count below 2,000 housing units were sampled  at 1-in-6 for those portions not in small governmental units  (governmental units with a population less than 2,500). Housing units  within census tracts and BNAs with 2,000 or more housing units were  sampled at 1-in-8 for those portions not in small governmental units.  Persons in group quarters were sampled at a 1-in-6 rate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sampling for the 2000 United States  Census</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every person and housing unit in  the United States was asked basic demographic and housing questions,  for example, race, age, relationship to householder, housing unit  vacancy status, and housing unit tenure. A sample of these people and  housing units was asked more detailed questions about items such as  income, occupation, and housing costs. The sampling unit for Census  2000 was the housing unit, including all occupants. There were four  different housing unit sampling rates: 1-in-8, 1-in-6, 1-in-4, and  1-in-2 (designed for an overall average of about 1-in-6). The Census  Bureau assigned these varying rates based on precensus occupied  housing unit estimates of various geographic and statistical entities,  such as incorporated places and interim census tracts. For people  living in group quarters or enumerated at long-form eligible service  sites (shelters and soup kitchens), the sampling unit was the person, and the sampling rate was 1-in-6.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record abstracts"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"1870 Social and Demographic
