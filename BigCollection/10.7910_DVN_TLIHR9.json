For this, techniques of vegetative propagation (tissue culture, grafting, cuttings and air layering) are applied\nto those species which include the safou (Dacryodes edulis \"G. Don\" HJ Lam.) (Burseraceae), which is a forest tree native to tropical and equatorial Africa. It plays an undeniable role in the lives of Farmers. In addition to its fruit eaten as a food supplement, its wood is used for heating and contribution of traditional medicine should not be overlooked.   The objective of this work is to identify clones that are better suited for air layering and assess the effect of the diameter of the marcots on its ability to take root. To achieve these objectives, 12 clones and two diameter classes (2-3 cm and 3-5 cm) were tested in this trial conducted following a randomized complete block."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-02-11"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Dacryodes edulis, vegetative propagation, macot, rooting ability, clone"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Plant propagation"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CGIAR"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CGIAR"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://worldagroforestry.org"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/worldagroforestry.org.agrof/files/agroforests_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-03-12"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-03-30"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-03-30"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Field trial data"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Cameroon"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"West & Central Africa"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Humid tropic node"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Disclaimer for data use","label":"Disclaimer.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":60547,"categories":["0 Disclaimer"],"dataFile":{"id":2474527,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Disclaimer.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":218935,"description":"Disclaimer for data use","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:204733","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f876174a62c66ad334a0109b2a23c529","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f876174a62c66ad334a0109b2a23c529"}}},{"description":"","label":"E.
