Once all sources were in the same unit they were combined into the same file. When all points were in the same file a spatial query was ran to select all the bathymetry points that fell outside of the Lake Victoria shoreline polygon. Any point that was located outside of the shoreline polygon was removed from the file. The next step was to remove the redundant points. PostgresSQL was used to find all the points that were within 100 meters from another point (SQL Code 1). One of the points would be removed from the final set of points to clean up the data. The points that were obtained from the survey conducted for the EAC/LVBC were not included in the removing of points within 100 meters of one another. Any point from version 6 that was located within 100 meters of a point from the Lake Victoria Regional Hydro-acoustics Working Group dataset, was removed. All points from the acoustic survey conducted by Lake Victoria Regional Hydro-acoustics Working Group were kept regardless of their distance from each other. PostgresSQL was also used to check the depths of points in relation to points around them to determine outliers (SQL Code 2). Outliers were double checked and removed if not deemed plausible. Points that were denoted as “greater than” the recorded depth were removed if the depth was less than 60.96 meters. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQL Code 1: Finds all points within 100 meters of another point\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nselect a.objectid, b.objectid\r\n<br>\r\nfrom lv_bathymetry_points_v5 as a, lv_bathymetry_points_v5 as b\r\n<br>\r\nwhere st_distance(a.geom,b.geom) < 100\r\n<br>\r\nand a.objectid != b.objectid\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQL Code 2: Checks for points with depths that are outliers compared to neighbor points\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nselect a.objectid, b.objectid, (@(a.z -
