The workshop was widely advertised, and was attended by 40 scientists from 12 different institutions including national labs, universities and private industry, as well as a representative from the Department of Energy. The final section of this document describes areas of community wide consensus that were developed as a result of the discussions held at that workshop. Areas where further study would be helpful to generate a consensus path forward for the US stellarator program are also discussed. The program outlined in this document is directly responsive to many of the strategic priorities of FES as articulated in ‘‘Fusion Energy Sciences: A Ten-Year Perspective (2015–2025)’’ [1]. The natural disruption immunity of the stellarator directly addresses ‘‘Elimination of transient events that can be deleterious to toroidal fusion plasma confinement devices’’ an area of critical importance for the US fusion energy sciences enterprise over the next decade. Another critical area of research ‘‘Strengthening our partnerships with international research facilities,’’ is being significantly advanced on the W7-X stellarator in Germany and serves as a test-bed for development of successful international collaboration on ITER. This report also outlines how materials science as it relates to plasma and fusion sciences, another critical research area, can be carried out effectively in a stellarator. Additionally, significant advances along two of the Research Directions outlined in the report; ‘‘Burning Plasma Science: Foundations—Next-generation research capabilities’’, and ‘‘Burning Plasma Science: Long pulse—Sustainment of Long-Pulse Plasma Equilibria’’ are proposed."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AEAD system"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"JET TAE system upgrade"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"RF amplifier"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"TAE diagnostic system"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"toroidal Alfven eigenmodes"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/16ja/16ja078/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-16-78</a><br /><br />This work was supported by the US Department of Energy Grant Number DE-FG02-99ER54563."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"16ja078_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":146135,"dataFile":{"id":3300985,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/ZQHDRE/0JPPNG","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZQHDRE/0JPPNG","filename":"16ja078_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1464352,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166d4d91b92-48c3dfba1029","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"8bb0162fbcdfe045c3b9d1fe2da9e5f6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"8bb0162fbcdfe045c3b9d1fe2da9e5f6"}}}]}}}
