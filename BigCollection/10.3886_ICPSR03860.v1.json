The candidates included Frank Lautenberg and Chuck Haytaian.  Residents of New Jersey were as\nked to rate the likelihood of their  voting in the election, to indicate their voting intentions and  preferences for candidates in the election, to comment on the job  performances of the candidates, and to identify one or two issues or  problems that were the most important to them in deciding who to vote  for. Respondents were also queried about their views on which  candidate would do more to cut taxes, to fight crime, to support  change in Congress, and to battle the special interests, as well as  which one was more likely to be a strong leader. Additional questions  probed respondents' opinions on whether local property taxes had gone  up, who was most to blame for the increase in local property taxes,  and what would happen to local property taxes in the next 12 months.  Opinions were also solicited on whether respondents approved of  Governor Christie Whitman's postponing some of her plans to cut taxes  for a year, how likely it was that Governor Whitman would succeed in  cutting the income tax by 30 percent within four years, and whether  they would like to see Governor Whitman run for vice president in  1996. Other topics addressed whether respondents supported legislation  to allow riverboat gambling in the Meadowlands, and whether they  supported legislation that would require authorities to notify  neighbors, schools, and youth groups whenever a convicted sex offender  moved into their community. In addition, respondents were asked to  comment on the job performance of President Clinton and Governor  Whitman, and whether they believed things in New Jersey were generally  going in the right direction. Background information on respondents  includes voter registration status, party preference, marital status,  education, household income, religious orientation, Hispanic origin, race, age, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional elections (US Senate)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lautenberg, Frank"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"New Jersey"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public approval"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Whitman, Christie"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
