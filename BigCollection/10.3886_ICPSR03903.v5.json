The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions include age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey includes questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health related disorders. Respondents are also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2002 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, gang involvement, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey and have been retained through the 2002 survey. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"addiction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol

Some of these changes were to correct for data errors, but most of these changes were done to provide consistency with the 2004 NSDUH study. Of these changes, the most important change to note is that two study design variables (VEREP and VESTR) were revised to provide consistency with the 2004 study, which collapsed the strata in order to maximize the number of people in each replicate.;Version Date: 2004-02-24Version Text: 2004-02-24 Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Variable NRCH17_2 (RECODED # R's CHILDREN under 18 IN HOUSEHOLD) was replaced to correct a coding error.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: LRECL with SAS, SPSS, and Stata setup files, SAS transport (XPORT) file, SPSS portable file, and Stata system file;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Data were collected and prepared for release by Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Prior to the 2002 survey, this series was titled National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Although the design of the 2002 survey is similar to the design of the 1999 through 2001 surveys, there are important methodological differences that affect the 2002 estimates. Each NSDUH respondent in 2002 was given an incentive payment of\n$30. This change resulted in an improvement in the survey response rate. In addition, new population data from the 2000 decennial Census became available for use in NSDUH sample weighting procedures. Therefore the data from 2002 and later should not be compared with data collected in 2001 or earlier to assess changes over time.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For selected variables, statistical imputation was performed following logical inference to replace missing responses. These variables are identified in the codebook as \"...LOGICALLY ASSIGNED\" for the logical procedure, or by the designation \"IMPUTATION-REVISED\" in the variable label when the statistical procedure was also performed. The names of statistically imputed variables begin with the letters \"IR\". For each imputation-revised variable there is a corresponding imputation indicator variable that indicates whether a case's value on the variable resulted from an interview response or was imputed. Missing values for some demographic variables were imputed by the unweighted hot-deck technique used in previous surveys. Beginning in 1999, imputation of missing values for most variables was accomplished using predictive mean neighborhoods (PMN), a new procedure developed specifically for this survey. Both the hot-deck and PMN imputation procedures are described in the codebook.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: To protect the privacy of respondents, all variables that could be used to identify individuals have been encrypted or collapsed in the public use file. To further ensure respondent confidentiality, the data producer used data substitution and deletion of state identifiers and a subsample of records in the creation of the public use file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Previously published estimates may not be exactly reproducible from the variables in the public use file due to the disclosure protection procedures that were implemented.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The setup and dictionary files for Stata are designed to be compatible with StataSE, Version 8.

A coordinated five-year sample design was developed for 1999 through 2003. Although there is no overlap with the 1998 sample, the design facilitates overlap in the first-stage units (area segments) between each two successive years in the five-year design. This design increases the precision of estimates in year-to-year trend analysis. The sample is stratified on multiple levels, beginning with states. Eight states are considered large sample states and contribute approximately 3,600 respondents per state. The remaining states are sampled to yield 900 respondents per state. The second level of stratification divides states into Field Interviewer (FI) Regions. The third level of stratification divides FI regions into area segments consisting of adjacent Census blocks. These area segments were used as the primary sampling units. Dwelling units in area segments were listed in a standardized order and were selected by systematic sampling. Field interviewers visited each sample address to determine dwelling unit eligibility, to list all eligible persons at the address, and to conduct interviews. Each respondent who completed a full interview was given a $30 cash payment. Persons were selected from the address roster using a handheld computer. To improve the precision of estimates, the sample allocation process targeted five age groups: 12-17, 18-25, 26-34, 35-49, and 50 and older. The size measures used in selecting the area segments were coordinated with the dwelling unit and person selection process so that a nearly self-weighting sample could be achieved in each of the five age groups. The sample design included approximately equal numbers of persons in the 12-17, 18-25, and 26 and older age groups. The achieved sample for the 2002 NSDUH was 68,126 persons. The public use file contains 54,079 records due to a subsampling step used in the disclosure protection procedures. Minimum item response requirements were defined for cases to be retained for weighting and further analysis (i.e., \"usable\" cases).
