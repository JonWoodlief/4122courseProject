During the fieldwork for Eurobarometer 44.3 (see  EUROBAROMETER 44.3: HEALTH CARE ISSUES AND PUBLIC SECURITY,  FEBRUARY-APRIL 1996 [ICPSR 6752]), an oversample (approximately 300  per country) of unemployed persons and housewives/househusbands, aged  15 years and over, was added to the basic sample and subsequently  administered an additional set of questions. Students and retired were  excluded from the oversample.  Respondents who were employed or  self-employed were asked questions concerning their job titles, the  ratio of women to men holding the same title, number of people  employed at their workplaces, how long they were continuously  employed/self-employed, how they found out about their jobs, the type  of organizations for which they worked, the number of hours worked,  job satisfaction, the type of communication equipment used, and the  circumstances under which they would reduce their hours or take unpaid  leave. Employed and self-employed respondents were asked about the  pay, training, skill level, variety, amount, pressure, and interest  involved in their work. They also compared their jobs with jobs they  were doing five years ago. Non-self-employed workers provided  additional information regarding their level of involvement in  decisions that affected their jobs, existence\nof promotional  opportunities, indices of pay raises or dismissal, likelihood of  leaving their jobs, and commitment to their current employers.  Questions posed to unemployed respondents covered how long they had  been unemployed, their former occupation, reasons for leaving their  last position, and whether they had received any compensation. They  were also asked if they were looking for a job, what approaches they  used to find a job, the amount of time spent looking for a job,  problems in trying to find a job, whether they would consider a  position requiring different skills, a lower level of skills, worse  physical conditions, or different hours, or if they would relocate.  These respondents also indicated whether they had experienced boredom,  depression, family tensions, loss of self-confidence, not enough  money, increased difficulty in rearing children, or lack of contact  with people as a result of being unemployed. All respondents were  asked questions concerning gender equality. Respondents were asked to  assess the current work situation for women with respect to wages, job  security, promotional opportunities, and the number and variety of  jobs available. Respondents were also asked to evaluate reasons why  women less often held positions of responsibility and to prioritize  areas of action to be taken to remedy existing  inequalities. Respondents also rated the impact of women's working on  the well-being of men, children, women, families, and  couples. Demographic data collected on respondents include gender,  age, nationality, marital status, occupation, income, left-right  political self-placement, age at completion of education, number of  people in household, number of children under 15 in household, subjective size of community, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European unification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gender issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.

Students and retired persons were excluded from the  oversample. Also, there was no oversample for Luxembourg and Northern  Ireland, and 14 cases from Luxembourg and 2 cases from Northern  Ireland were dropped. (2) Three respondents (IC\nPSR CASE ID 18571,  18607, and 19299) with non-EU nationalities were permitted to complete  interviews. If desired, these cases can be excluded from analysis. (3)  The code 13 (\"Not applicable -- self-employed\") for the variable V92  (Q.16) does not correspond with the distribution of code 01  (\"Self-employed\") for the variable V67 (Q.8). (4) Some cases coded as  0 (\"NA\") in V140-V144 (Q.25A) were allowed to be asked Q.25B while  others were not. (5) The distribution of the variable V273 (Q.64) is  not logically consistent with the distribution of V210 (Q.43).

Response data,  however, are divided between the two studies in the following manner:  EB44.3: Q.1 to Q.4B, Q.5B, Q.111 to Q.155, demographic and protocol  questions, and EB44.3OVR: Q.1 to Q.110, demographic and protocol  questions.
