Unlike previous years, the data are presented in seven separate parts: Part 1, Work Done Record (Replacement or Additions to the House), Part 2, Journey to Work Record, Part 3, Mortgages (Owners Only), Part 4, Housing Unit Record (Main Record), Recodes (One Record per Housing Unit), and Weights, Part 5, Manager and Owner Record (Renters Only), Part 6, Person Record, Part 7, Mover Group Record. Data include year the structure was built, type and number of living quarters, occupancy status, access, number of rooms, presence of commercial establishments on the property, and property value. Additional data focus on kitchen and plumbing facilities, types of heating fuel used, source of water, sewage disposal, heating and air-conditioning equipment, and major additions, alterations, or repairs to the property. Information provided on housing expenses includes monthly mortgage or rent payments, cost of services such as utilities, garbage collection, and property insurance, and amount of real estate taxes paid in the previous year. Also included is information on whether the household received government assistance to help pay heating or cooling costs or for other energy-related services. Similar data are provided for housing units previously occupied by respondents who had recently moved. Additionally, indicators of housing and neighborhood quality are supplied. Housing quality variables include privacy of bedrooms, condition of kitchen facilities, basement or roof leakage, breakdowns of plumbing facilities and equipment, and overall opinion of the structure. For quality of neighborhood, variables include use of exterminator services, existence of boarded-up buildings, and overall quality of the neighborhood. In addition to housing characteristics, some demographic data are provided on household members, such as age, sex, race, marital status, income, and relationship to householder. Additional data provided on the householder include years of school completed, Spanish origin, length of residence, and length of occupancy."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"commuting

All interviews are conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) software, allowing new responses to some questions. Rather than existing as a single file, this collection consists of seven parts, each containing data pertaining to a specific subject matter. In addition, data for building and neighborhood questions ceased to be collected through interviewer observation. Rather, these questions have been reworded for the respondents. Due to these changes, users are asked to use caution when comparing data prior to 1997 with data from 1997 forward.

The same basic sample of housing units is interviewed every 2 years until a new sample is selected. The United States Census Bureau updates the sample by adding newly constructed housing units and units discovered through coverage improvement efforts. For the 2007 American Housing Survey--National sample (AHS-N), approximately 60,000 sample housing units were originally selected for interview. Due to budgetary constraints, roughly 8 percent of these units were taken out of the sample and were not interviewed in 2007. These reduced units are eligible for reinstatement in future enumerations. About 2,150 of the remaining 55,000 total units included for interview were found to be ineligible because the unit no longer existed or because the units did not meet the AHS-N definition of a housing unit. Of the 52,850 eligible sample units, about 6,550 were classified (both occupied and vacant housing units), as ‘‘Type A’’ noninterviews because (a) no one was at home after repeated visits, (b) the respondent refused to be interviewed, or (c) the interviewer was unable to find the unit. This classification produced an unweighted overall response rate of 88 percent.
