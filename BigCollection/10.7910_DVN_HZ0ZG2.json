Semen samples were analyzed and compared with the SwimCount™ results. An aliquot of 0.5 mL of the semen sample was added to the SwimCount™ and a WHO 5th semen analysis was performed. Results were categorized as low (<5×106/mL), and normal to high (≥5×106/mL) total progressively motile sperm concentration. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the SwimCount™.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe mean total progressively motile sperm concentration was 26.7×106/mL. Semen analysis revealed that 28% of the samples were below the threshold count of 5 million/mL total progressively motile sperm concentration. The mean total progressively motile sperm concentration of the light color SwimCount™ result group determined by semen analysis was 7.5×106/mL, and the mean total progressively motile sperm concentration of the moderate to dark color SwimCount™ result group was 34.2×106/mL. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.94; p<0.001) was obtained when the SwimCount™ was compared with semen analysis. The sensitivity and specificity were obtained at a cut off value of 5.0×106/mL total progressively motile sperm concentration, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% and 73.4%.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nWe confirmed the reliability of the SwimCount™ as a home-based device for male fertility by evaluating the total progressively motile sperm concentration."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Park, Hyun Jun"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-01-25"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Swim count database WJMH submit data.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149778,"dataFile":{"id":3347536,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Swim count database WJMH submit data.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":24745,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16886c3685b-b024ea75cd38","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f06a89c7494124cdd1eb4b70913f589f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f06a89c7494124cdd1eb4b70913f589f"}}}]}}}
