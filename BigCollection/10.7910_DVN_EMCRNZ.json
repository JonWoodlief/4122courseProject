S100A4, an important member of the S100 protein family, serves to promote tumor progression and metastasis. By conducting this study, we aim to examine the role of S100A4 in the prognosis of colon cancer and to demonstrate its prognostic significance.\r\nMethods: Tissue samples of colon cancer from 148 patients who underwent colon resection due to colon cancer were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining to determine the protein expression levels of S100A4. The protein expression levels of S100A4 in tumor tissue were matched with the clinicopathologic factors including patient survival.\r\nResults: Cytoplasmic expression of S100A4 protein was demonstrated in the tumor tissue of 132 patients (89.2%) out of a total of 148 study patients. Statistically, the expression levels of the cytoplasmic S100A4 protein correlated significantly with the TNM stages and patient survival. The distribution of the S100A4 protein staining in the tumor tissue was associated with the age groups, tumor localization, TNM staging, and patient survival with statistical significance. The levels of S100A4 protein expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for TNM staging and poor survival.\r\nConclusion: Expression of the S100A4 protein in colon cancers may be an indicator of tumor progression and lymph node metastasis and may be useful for predicting the overall survival of the patients with colon cancer. In patients with colon cancer, it may be used as an indicator of poor prognosis.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-04-23"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Colon cancer, S100A4 protein, Prognostic factor "},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MeSH"},"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"S100A4 may be a good prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for colon cancer\r\n(Under review)"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"url"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1828791"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://mts.hindawi.com/author/1828791/"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The research article is in the publication stage and the investigation is continuing."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Destek, Sabahattin"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-04-23"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Statistical Study ","label":"DATA S100A4 may be a good prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for colon cancer.docx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136511,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":3146736,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EMCRNZ/WCJFR4","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EMCRNZ/WCJFR4","filename":"DATA S100A4 may be a good prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for colon cancer.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":52921,"description":"Statistical Study ","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:162f280cfc7-f66399ca54ce","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"97641f9aa9b7f33f0997eae135d31dcb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"97641f9aa9b7f33f0997eae135d31dcb"}}},{"description":"Full Text Article","label":"S100A4 may be a good prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for colon cancer.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136511,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":3146737,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EMCRNZ/7KCSYK","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EMCRNZ/7KCSYK","filename":"S100A4 may be a good prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for colon cancer.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":473275,"description":"Full Text Article","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:162f27e1039-2153306a8064","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"603f8526b835e43e7987d9feff0d0a3c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"603f8526b835e43e7987d9feff0d0a3c"}}}]}}}
