Respondents were asked for  their opinions on Clinton's handling of the presidency, their  impressions of Clinton, and their views on how he would be remembered  in history. Those queried were asked to rate Clinton's  accomplishments, leadership, judgment, and communication skills while  president. Their views were also sought on whether the next president  should move the count\nry in a new direction or continue the Clinton  era, whether Clinton or the Republican Congress would do a better job  coping with the nation's main problems over the next year, and whether  they would be sorry or glad to see Clinton leave office. A final  question asked respondents if they would vote for Clinton or Texas  governor George W. Bush, were Clinton allowed to seek a third term as  president.
