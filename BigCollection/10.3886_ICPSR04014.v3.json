Views were sought on the 2004 presidential campaign prior to the upcoming presidential primaries held on Super Tuesday, March 2, 2004, as well as President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the economy, the situation with Iraq, and the war against terrorism. Respondents were polled on how much attention they paid to the 2004 presidential campaign, whether they would vote for President Bush or a Democratic candidate, whom they expected to win, whether their mind was made up, what issue they most wanted candidates to discuss, and whether they planned to vote or had already voted in a Republican or Democratic primary or caucus. Opinions were solicited on Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader, as well as Democratic presidential candidates John Edwards, John Kerry, Dennis Kucinich, and Al Sharpton. Respondents were asked who the Democratic party should nominate as its presidential candidate, whether they preferred a candidate who supported more or less restrictions on foreign trade, whether a candidate's position on issues or ability to defeat Bush was most important in their choice, whether they had ever supported candidate Howard Dean, and their level of satisfaction if Kerry or Edwards won the nomination. Respondents also rated their level of confidence in the ability of Bush, Kerry, and Edwards to handle an international crisis, whether each cared about the needs and problems of people like the respondent, and whether their decisions were influenced by special interests. Several questions asked whether the result of the war with Iraq was worth the human and economic costs, whether the United States made the right decision in taking military action against Iraq, whether Iraq was a threat to the United States before the war, whether it had weapons of mass destruction, and how well the Bush administration assessed the threat of these weapons prior to the war. Additional topics addressed the condition of the national economy, the effect of the Bush administration's policies on the number of jobs available, whether respondents would support or oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, and whether they would ever vote for a candidate who d\nidn't share their views on gay marriage. Background variables include age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, education, religion, religiosity, household income, number of telephone lines in household, political party affiliation, political orientation, and voter registration and participation
