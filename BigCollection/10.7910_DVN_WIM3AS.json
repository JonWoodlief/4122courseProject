Initially, they sought to contribute by adding an intervention to the already-planned gathering and filming the entire process. Their plans shifted to the resulting work, Scenarios Preparations which was composed of footage they had shot in 2011. \r\nThe work Scenarios Preparations shows a series of imaginary rehearsals: improvisational exercises meant to prepare the participants for their anticipated encounter with the Israeli army in extraterritorial waters. These exercises were mostly part directed by a Dutch theatre director and were held at a fringe theatre venue in Amsterdam. Other improvisation exercises, led by one of the organisation’s representatives who had also participated in the 2010 Gaza flotilla, took place at a secret location on the Greek island from which the Dutch boat was to set sail; these exercises were dedicated to practising the actual scenarios of engagement with the Israeli army, including specific behaviour guidelines determined by the organisers.
