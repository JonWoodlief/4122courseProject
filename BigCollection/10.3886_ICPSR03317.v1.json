The GPI challenged schools of medicine,  in collaboration with state governments, private insurers, HMOs,  hospitals, and community health centers, to increase the supply of  generalist physicians (general internal medicine, general pediatrics,  family practice, and general practice).  ACMET II gauged views on  primary care and specialist medical careers, factors affecting  residency choice, faculty influences on medical students and  residents, and time spent in various settings (inpatient, outpatient,  emergency ward, managed care, and long-term care settings) during  electives, clerkships, internships, and residency.
