The experimental plots consisted of Gmelina (Gmelina arborea R.Br.) trees planted at 1 × 10 m with maize intercropped in the 10 m-wide alleys between lines of trees. Pruning levels consisted of retaining a live crown ratio of 60–70% (T 1), 40–50% (T 2); 30–40% (T 3) and of 20–30% (T 4). At the end of the experiment, the total maize grain yield was highest under the high pruning intensity (T 4) (18.06 t ha−1) and lowest under T 1 (14.48 t ha−1). Maize grain yield under the pruning regime T 2 and T 3 were 16.08 and 17.21 t ha−1, respectively\n. Mean annual increment (MAI) in tree diameter was greater (5.0 cm year−1) under T 1 than those at T 4 (4.1 cm year−1). Pruning regimes T 2 and T 3 resulted in a MAI of 4.7 and 4.5 cm year−1, respectively. Financial analysis showed that maize-tree systems under T 4 were more profitable than under T 1 as long as the reduction of the average dbh at harvest were not greater than 1 cm. Pruning trees intensively also generated greater returns from labour than moderate pruning, as the greater maize grain yields under T 4 compensated for the cost of pruning and the lower timber yield. In the context of resource-poor farmers, intensive branch pruning was a practice that prolonged the period of profitable intercropping and was compatible with commercial timber production."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pruning"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Timber trees"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Financial analysis"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Tree intercropping"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Tree–crop interactions"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gmelina arborea"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bertomeu M, Roshetko JM and Rahayu S. 2011.
