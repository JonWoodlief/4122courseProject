The purpose was to collect data on the   prevalence and incidence of\nmental disorders and on the use of and need   for services by the mentally ill. Independent research teams at five   universities (Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Washington   University, Duke University, and University of California at Los   Angeles), in collaboration with the National Institute for Mental   Health, conducted the studies with a core of common questions and   sample characteristics. The sites were areas that had previously been   designated as Community Mental Health Center catchment areas: New   Haven, Connecticut, Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Durham,   North Carolina, and Los Angeles, California. Each site sampled over   3,000 community residents and 500 residents of institutions, yielding   20,861 respondents overall. The longitudinal ECA design incorporated   two waves of personal interviews administered one year apart and a   brief telephone interview in between (for the household sample). The   diagnostic interview used in the ECA was the NIMH Diagnostic Interview   Schedule (DIS), Version III (with the exception of the Yale Wave I   survey, which used Version II). Diagnoses were categorized according to   the DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, 3rd Edition   (DSM-III). Diagnoses derived from the DIS include manic episode,   dysthymia, bipolar disorder, single episode major depression, recurrent   major depression, atypical bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse or   dependence, drug abuse or dependence, schizophrenia, schizophreniform,   obsessive compulsive disorder, phobia, somatization, panic, antisocial   personality, and anorexia nervosa. The DIS uses the Mini-Mental State   Examination (MMSE), which measures cognitive functioning, as an   indirect measure of the DSM-III Organic Mental Disorders. In the ECA  survey, this diagnosis is called cognitive impairment."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"epidemiology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental disorders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"needs assessment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
