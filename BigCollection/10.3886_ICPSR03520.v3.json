Respondents gave their views on the role of the agricultural policy of the European Union (EU), whether the policy was playing its role well or badly, in what situations the EU should use an agricultural policy, and whether the EU should subsidize agricultural products or grant more funds to the overall rural economy and to direct support for farmers. Another subject of the surveys was energy problems. Respondents indicated to what extent different sources of energy were used in their countries, whether energy use was increasing, which energy sources contributed significantly to global warming and climate change, and which factors could make a significant impact on the amount of energy used in the EU. Those polled provided their opinions on how to solve the problem of EU dependency on other countries in terms of energy s\nupply, what governments' priorities with respect to energy should be, and the main reason for lack of interest among young people in energy-related matters. They were also asked what they were doing to save energy, what energy-saving measures they would support, whether they would pay more for energy produced from renewable sources, whether they paid attention to energy use when buying products, whether they knew how much they paid for electricity last year, and whether they were aware of EU activities in energy-related research. Respondents named what sources they used to obtain information about energy issues, gave their opinions about producing nuclear energy using nuclear fusion, named energy-related areas that they would like to know more about, indicated which energy sources would be least expensive, most efficient, and environmentally friendly in 2050, and commented on whether in 20 years all energy needs would be satisfied by one or by a mix of different energy sources, and if so, which ones. The poll also elicited respondents' views on discrimination issues. Those polled were asked whether in the last two years they themselves were discriminated against or harassed or witnessed someone being discriminated against or harassed at work, when looking for a job, in public places, when getting housing, or when they were at school, and if so, what the reason was. Respondents were also asked whether they and people in general thought that it was right/wrong to refuse to give anyone a job, training, or promotion, or to deal differently with customers based on their ethnicity, religion, physical disability, mental illness, age, or sexual orientation. In addition, respondents were asked whether they knew their rights in case they felt discriminated against and whether they were willing to complain or go to court if something like that happened. Demographic and other background information collected includes respondents' age, gender, nationality, marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at completion of education, household income, type and size of locality, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"age
