Several types of radar signal waveforms were stored (e.g. LFM, barker, and, pulsed carrier). Class 0 means that no radar emissions are present. In both class 0 and class 1 images, WiFi and LTE signals may be present.\r\n \r\nFor more information regarding the context/scenario where the CNN was used, we encourage reading the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00462.pdf"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Computer and Information Science","Engineering"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"deep learning"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ahmed Selim, Francisco Paisana, Jerome A.
