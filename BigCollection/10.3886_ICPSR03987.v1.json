The empirical models  included standard socioeconomic variables, such as income, population  density, and race, along with variables that controlled for fixed  effects associated with the courts' geographic location. The study  also addressed the pressing issue of allocating judgeships across  circuits and districts.

Between 1904 and 2002, civil cases grew at an  average annual rate of about 3 percent, a rate far greater than the  growth of population or per capita income over the same period. By  contrast, criminal case filings increased more slowly over the past 60  years -- by about 0.5 percent annually on the average. First, using  econometric techniques, this study sought to provide forecasts of  future demands on the federal courts, reducing forecasting errors by  taking account of the time series properties of the case  data. Out-of-sample forecasts were generated through 2020. Secondly,  the study also specified and estimated multivariate econometric models  of the determinants of civil case filings over time and across  geographic space using panel data techniques. The study investigated  the distribution of federal civil cases across states, districts, and  circuits. Models were presented that policymakers can use to forecast  the future caseloads of the federal court system as a whole and to  estimate how the total caseload can be expected to be distributed geographically."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In order to specify and estimate models of the  determinants of the demand for federal district court cas\nes, the  researchers constructed a comprehensive dataset based on aggregated  annual case volumes of individual district courts. They analyzed the  stochastic behavior of aggregate annual civil and criminal case  filings spanning the 1904-1998 period, for a total of 95 yearly  observations. The objective was to ascertain whether the series was a  realization of stationary versus nonstationary stochastic processes, a  crucial distinction regarding the underlying data generating process  to the development of a univariate time-series forecasting model. The  time series of civil and criminal cases was also subjected to a  variety of unit-root tests to obtain robust evidence regarding the  degree of smoothness in the series under study. In an attempt to model  the socioeconomic factors possibly associated with the increased civil  case filings since the 1960s, the study also investigated the  distribution of federal civil cases across states, districts, and  circuits. Civil case filings were analyzed using three different  categories: United States cases, private cases, and their summed  total. Due to lack of data for the 1961-1998 period at more  disaggregated levels, the modeling for the three categories of cases  was limited to three levels: (1) statewide models using district-level  observations aggregated to the state level, (2) districtwide models to  analyze the influence of the factors at the district level, and (3)  circuitwide models using district-level observations aggregated to the  circuit level. The empirical models included standard socioeconomic  variables, such as income, population density, and race, along with  variables that controlled for fixed effects associated with the  courts' geographic location. For the sake of continuity, the Fifth  Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit were treated as a single circuit, the  Fifth Circuit. The researchers also investigated the interplay between  criminal and civil caseloads by collecting panel data from 1968 to  1998. These data included variables on judgeships per district, disposition of cases, and drug and immigration cases."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data in Part 1 (Federal Court Civil and  Criminal Cases, 1904-1998) contain information for year, total civil  cases, and total criminal cases separately and added together.
