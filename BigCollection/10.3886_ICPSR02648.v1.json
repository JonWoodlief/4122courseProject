Respondents were asked for their opinions on  President Clinton, the United States Congress, and the nation's  economy. Those queried were asked to rate the likelihood that they  would vote in the election, to compare their interest level in this  election to previous elections, and to declare which party's  candidates they intended to vote for. Respondents were asked whether  their decisions were driven by a desire to express support for either  Clinton or the Republican Congress, or to express opposition to either  Clinton or the Republican Congress. Their views were sought on the  importance of the following issues in their electoral decisions:  education, taxes, the Clinton/Lewinsky matter, Social Security, health  care, moral and ethical standards, the economy, and jobs. Looking  ahead to the 2000 presidential election, respondents were asked for  whom they would vote given a choice between Vice President Al Gore and  Texas Governor George W. Bush. An additional topic covered the future  of Clinton's second t\nerm, the impeachment hearings and surrounding  investigations, and the Republicans' handling of the  investigation. Background information on respondents includes age,  sex, political party, political orientation, education, race,  religion, voter registration and participation history, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
