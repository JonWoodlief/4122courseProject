The project documents the  dynamics of family poverty and welfare use in California. Part 1,  Overview Data: Cases contains one record for each CWPDP case sampled  between October 1992 and March 1997. For each case, seven data  presence indicator variables identify the presence of data in each of  the data file types. Four observation variables identify the number of  case-months records observed in the Four County Cases file, the number  of person records observed in the Four County Persons and Assistance  History Persons files, and the first month during which AFDC  participation is observed in the Assistance History Persons file.  Fifteen survey detail variables identify survey participation,  interview completion, respondent's person number and date of birth,  and the survey record number. Parts 2-5, Four County Data: Cases,  contain case-month records for all control and experimental cases  selected to be a part of the study between October 1992 and March 1997  for any month (beginning with the month selected) during which an  assistance unit received AFDC of food stamps. Each case-month record  contains county administrative data for eligible family size and type,  income, and cash and food stamp assistance amounts. These files are  identical to the Four County Data: Cases files in County Welfare  Administrative Data Version 4. Parts 6-9, Four County Data: Persons,  contain records for each person observed associated with any control  or experimental case selected to be part of the study between October  1992 and March 1997. Records include nonconfidential demographic  information and monthly values for aid type and eligibility. These  files are identical to the Four County Data: Persons files in County  Welfare Administrative Data Version 4. Parts 10-13, Assistance History  Data: Aggregate, contain case-month records that summarize information  for the months of January 1987 through December 1996 about the public  assistance program participation and eligibility of persons associated  with sampled cases. This dataset was constructed from the Assistance  History Data: Persons datasets (Parts 14-17) that contain persons  associated with the study units. Parts 14-17, Assistance History Data:  Persons, contain the Medi-Cal and program participation history of  each person associated with the assistance units for cases selected  between October 1992 and March 1997. This dataset does not include  information about persons who left the assistance unit before the  month sampled. Each record includes program participation information  for each month from January 1987 through December 1996, a total of 120  months, as well as demographic information. Parts 18-21, Medi-Cal  Payments Data: Cases, contain one record for each case selected to be  part of the CWPDP sample between December 1992 and March 1997. This  dataset contains the Medi-Cal payments made for each case in the study  for the month of December 1992 and quarterly from 1993 through the  fourth quarter of 1997. University of California Data Archive and  Technical Assistance receives this data from California Department of  Social Services-Research Branch (CDSS-RB) by quarter (not month),  aggregated to case number. Therefore, the data in these files ar\ne  aggregated payments information for all assistance units with the same  case number, whether or not that assistance unit is part of the CWPDP  sample. These files are identical to the Medi-Cal Payments Data: Cases files in County Welfare Administrative Data Version 3."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"low income groups"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicaid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public administration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public assistance programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"welfare services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DATAPASS I.

These data were collected for the purpose  of administering a state assistance program. Without some  understanding of the context of Welfare programs in California, users  of these data may have difficulty conducting contextually meaningful  analysis. Because of the interrelated nature of the\nfiles represented  here, users are strongly advised to examine carefully the entire set  of available files before beginning analysis.

The files in Version 4.1 correct  a coding error in both the Version 4 Assistance History Data:  Aggregate files and the Version 4 Assistance History Data: Persons  files. Variables in the Overview Data: Cases files that relate to  these two sets of data were also changed to reflect the corrections  made to the Assistance History Data files.

The weight variable for additional sample cases was  modified to account for undersampling of new sample cases due to the  delayed entry of cases into the Medi-Cal Eligibility Data System (and,  therefore, into the sampling pool). In Version 4, two weights were  included for each case: the Sampling Interval Weight and the County  Caseload Weight. The Sampling Interval Weight is the original weight  implied by the sampling method. The County Caseload Weight is the  weight needed to expand the original sample to the December 1992  caseload (for county-aid code cells) and to expand the additional  samples to the number of new approvals (for county-aid code cells)  during the sample month. Using state administrative data, County  Caseload Weights were calculated by the principal investigator staff  to reflect the number of AFDC cases a sample case represents.  Expanding the original sample cases by using the County Caseload  Weights, more accurately reflects the caseloads of the counties during  December 1992. Similarly, expanding the additional sample cases by  using the County Caseload Weights, more accurately reflects the number  of new cases in the counties during the month selected for sample.  After December 1992, it is not possible to weight up samples to  determine county caseloads since certain types of cases were excluded  from sampling. Additional sample cases can only be expanded to the number of cases new to welfare during the study period."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Assistance History Data Aggregate (Alameda
