The research team sought (1) to provide a  national program- level process evaluation of the Campus Program, and  (2) to inform policies and practices that address violence against  women on campuses and ensure victim safety and offender  accountability. The research team proposed a process evaluation aimed  at describing the process of program planning, implementation, and  problem resolution. The premise of the VAWO Campus Program was that  colleges and universities had the ability to educate and shape the  values, attitudes, and behaviors of young men and women toward the  issue of violence against women. In 1994 Congress passed the Viol\nence  Against Women Act to improve the criminal justice system's response to  the crimes of sexual assault, domestic violence, and stalking. The  need to address the victimization of college women was supported by  research indicating that college women were at a greater risk of rape  and other forms of sexual assault than women of comparable age in the  general population. In 1998 VAWO received funds for the Campus  Program, which recognized that within the college and university  environment, educational programming on violence against women, victim  assistance resources, reporting and investigative processes,  disciplinary policies, and other factors can have a significant  influence on women's safety and on whether victims step forward to  seek assistance and report these crimes. Federal Fiscal Year 1999 was  the first year in which colleges and universities received funding  under the Campus Program. The Campus Program grantees varied  geographically, by size, and by other demographic characteristics, and  included both public and private institutions. The size of the student  bodies ranged from approximately 800 to more than 50,000. VAWO's grant  application package for the Campus Program outlined three minimum  requirements that all 38 projects were required to address. First, all  projects were expected to create a coordinated community response to  violence against women on campus and were encouraged to form  partnerships with at least one non-profit, non-governmental victim  service provider. Second, grantees were to establish a mandatory  prevention and education program for all incoming students, working in  collaboration with campus and community-based victim advocacy  organizations. The program was to include information about dating  violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Third, grantees were required  to train campus police to respond effectively in sexual assault,  domestic violence, and stalking cases. An additional requirement was  added for fiscal 2000 grantees, which called for training of judicial board members."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Specifically, the process evaluation was to  consist of a review of all grantees in the program through visits to  each site. Prior to the evaluation's start, the research team  established an advisory board to aid in designing the methodology.  This board was composed of six individuals, including a researcher who  had done work in the area of violence against women on campuses, a  student, a university police chief, a sexual assault services  coordinator from a university, and a director of student judicial  services. Because of the large number of sites in the program, the  research team was limited in the extent to which a thorough process  evaluation could be conducted. At the request of NIJ, the research  staff made only one trip to each site to collect administrative  records data and conduct interviews relating to project activities.  There were not enough funds to make subsequent trips to sites to judge  their progress over time. Moreover, it was not possible to do  follow-up telephone calls thereby maintaining contact with grantees on  their implementation efforts. In short, the process evaluation  depended on a snapshot view of the campuses at the time of the site  visit. Each visit typically lasted two to three days, during which as  many as a dozen interviews might take place. Interviewees usually  included the project director, on-campus advocate, campus law  enforcement, judicial affairs personnel, education coordinator,  women's center, community partners, dean of students, representatives  from student organizations, and project evaluator. Project directors  frequently prepared large packets of information on their institutions  and their project activities for the research staff. It was common for  interviewees to provide documentation of their role in the project, or  summary information on their office/organization. From the interviews,\nthe research team typically collected copies of progress reports sent  to VAWO, summary sheets of campus demographics, student handbooks,  training manuals for advocates and disciplinary board members, and  copies of all orientation materials as well as other educational  curriculum materials, newspaper articles relating to the project,  relevant police orders, crime statistics, and summary advocacy  statistics. Other items collected across the campuses ranged from  copies of all advertising materials (mailers, posters, mugs, t-shirts,  magnets, buttons) to videos of major project presentations. To  facilitate the visits, the research team developed several protocols  to allow for structured interviews. The protocols provided for  consistent data collection across the campuses. After conducting a  visit, the research staff prepared a site report, usually 20 to 25  pages in length, which represented a process evaluation report for a  particular grantee/site. These reports were sent to the project  directors at the sites for their review. The research staff made  appropriate changes to the reports as a result of these reviews and  then submitted them to NIJ as a deliverable product from the  evaluation. Part 1 data consist of basic information about each  grantee's campus and the violence against women programs and services  available at each site. Data for Part 2 were collected using a  Partnership Survey, which was a supplement to the site visit  observations. The purpose of the survey, which was administered to  grant project staff, was to document perceptions of project  participants about program collaboration. From the 35-item  questionnaire, respondents were asked to indicate on a five-point  scale the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with items grouped  into three categories: those regarding the partnership, the project,  and individual participation. Respondents were also invited to provide  comments on any survey item. The survey questionnaire was made  available for downloading to all project directors through the  Institute of Law and Justice's Web site. Copies were also distributed  at site visit interviews. Respondents were given the option of mailing  or faxing their completed surveys. A total of 247 surveys were received, representing 33 of the 38 campuses."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables for Part 1 include whether an institution  was public or private, located in an urban, suburban, or rural area,  the number of students comprising the student population, whether  students were residential or commuters, the year of the grant award,  award amount, level of programming at the time of the award, whether  there were campus police special units, conduct code for stalking,  coordinated community response, relationship violence counseling, a  Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE), sexual assault counseling, court  accompaniment, hospital accompaniment, shelter services, legal  advocacy services, hot-lines, language interpreters, and if campus  police had any of the following training: sexual assault sensitivity  training, domestic violence sensitivity training, stalking sensitivity  training, sexual assault procedural training, and domestic violence  training.
