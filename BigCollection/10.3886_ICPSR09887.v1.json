Respondents were asked to identify the   most important problem facing the country, to indicate whether they   approved or disapproved of Bush's handling of the presidency in general   and of his handling of foreign affairs and the economy in particular,   and to offer opinions on whether Bush was able to deal with the big   issues that faced the country. Those surveyed were also asked if they   approved of the way their own United States Representative was handling   his or her job, and whether they approved of the way Congress was doing   its job. Concerning economic matters, respondents were asked how the   money from potential cuts in military spending should be used, whether   they were better off financially than in 1989 when Bush became   president, and whether Bush or the Democrats in Congress could be   trusted to do a better job on the economy. Concerning political   parties, respondents were asked whether the Democrats or Republicans   better represented the interests of various groups of people, and   whether the Democrats or Republicans could do a better job of coping   with the main problems the nation would face in the coming years.   Focusing on health care, respondents were asked whether they trusted   Bush or the Democrats in Congress to do a better job of improving the   health care system in this country, whether they could vote for a   candidate whose position on health care was different from theirs, and   if a candidate's position on health care was the most important issue   to consider in deciding whether to support that candidate. With respect   to Bush's 1992 State of the Union address, those surveyed were asked if   they approved of most of the proposals made in the speech, how much   Bush's economic proposals would help the economy and the respondent's   own financial situation, and whether Bush would be able to accomplish   most of the goals he outlined in his speech. Concerning the Persian   Gulf War, the survey asked respondents whether the war had been worth   fighting considering its cost to the United States versus its benefit,   and whether the respondent was more likely to support Bush for a second   term as a result of the Gulf War. Regarding the issue of extramarital   affairs involving a presidential candidate, respondents were asked if   they could vote for a candidate who had had an affair, whether the   allegation that Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton had had   an affair would have an effect on their vote, and if that should be an   issue in the presidential election. Respondents were also asked whether   Clinton should withdraw from the race if it turned out that he did have   an affair with Gennifer Flowers, whether his withdrawal should be based   on having had an affair or having denied it, and whether Clinton or   Flowers had told the truth. Concerning the 1992 presidential election,   respondents were asked for whom they would vote if their state held a   Democratic or Republican primary/caucus for president, toward whom they   were leaning at the time of the interview, whether they would vote for   Bush or various other prospective candidates/nominees if the national   election were held at the time of the interview,\nand toward whom they   were leaning at the time of the interview. Those surveyed were also   asked their views concerning presidential primaries and caucuses, and   about their expectations for the 1992 presidential campaign. Additional   campaign questions asked respondents if who is elected in 1992 really   made any difference, and whether they thought that they were being   referred to when Republican and Democratic candidates for political   office talked about the middle class. Other questions dealt with the   respondent's impression of various candidates involved in the 1992   presidential election, the reelection of the respondent's   representative in Congress, and the chances of the respondent's voting   in the 1992 presidential election. Background information on   respondents includes political alignment, voter registration status,   most recent presidential vote choice, education, age, race, income,   economic class, religion, marital status, household composition, labor  union membership, urban/suburban/rural residence, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush Administration (1989-1993)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George H.W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign affiars"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military spending"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"misconduct in office"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Persian Gulf War"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
