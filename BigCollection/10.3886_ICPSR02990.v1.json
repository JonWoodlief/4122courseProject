Articles and  broadcast transcripts were drawn from three sources: THE NEW YORK  TIMES, ABC News, and CNN News. Coverage of the following four scandals  were analyzed: the Iran-Contra affair (President Reagan and his  staff's alleged illegal sale of weapons to Iran and the use of that  profit to aid Nicaraguan rebels), Gary Hart's affair (presidential  candidate accused of having an affair with model Donna Rice), Clinton  fundraising (President Clinton and the Democratic National Party  accused of illegally soliciting campaign contributions for the  president's reelection bid), and the Monica Lewinsky affair (President  Clinton accused of having an affair with White House intern Monica  Lewinsky). News coverage, from the break of the story to one week  following, was coded according to the subject of the story the news  source, whether the story was factual, whether it was an analysis or a  personal profile, whether the story was critical, sympathetic, or  neutral, headline prominence, placement in the news lineup, presence  of an \"importance phrase\", presence of additional issue-oriented  stories, length of article/broadcast, whether the story made a  prediction, the points of view presented, use of sensationalized  words/phrases, number and type of sources, whether the story reported  facts from other news sources, whether the story utilized rumors or  unconfirmed facts, whether the report introduced a new fact or  development, whether a reporter or commentator was consulted in  addition to the host (if a broadcast), whether sensitive facts were  presented, whether the story was placed in a political context, and whether the story mentioned previous events in the scandal."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton Administration (1993-2001)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government corruption"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hart, Gary"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Iran Contra affair"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lewinsky scandal"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"media coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"misconduct in office"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"news media"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"politicians"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public figures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Reagan Administration (1981-1989)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
