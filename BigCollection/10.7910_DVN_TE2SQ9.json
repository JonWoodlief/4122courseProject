Existing studies tend to focus on the domestic factors that shape conflict initiation. In this article, I show how domestic institutions interact with international institutions to produce more cooperative outcomes. Particularly, this study argues that as autocracies become more central in the network of liberal institutions such as preferential trade agreements (PTAs), they are less likely to initiate a militarized interstate dispute (MID). As a state becomes more democratic, the effect of centrality within the PTA network on the peaceful dispute settlement dissipates. This is because greater embeddedness in the PTA regime is associated with enhanced transparency for autocracies, which allows autocracies to mitigate ex ante informational problems in dispute resolution. Using a dataset of MID initiation from 1965 to 1999, this study finds robust empirical support for the aforementioned hypothesis. Moreover, the results are substantively significant. Further analysis into the causal mechanisms at work provides evidence in favor of the information mechanism. Autocrats who are more embedded in the PTA network tend to have higher levels of economic transparency and economic transparency itself is associated with lower rates of conflict initiation. The results suggest that an autocratâ€™s structural position within the international system can help to peacefully settle its disputes."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-12-21"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343316687018"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Mazumder, Shom"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-12-21"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Untar file to run","label":"Mazumder-2017-JPR-replication-package.tar.gz","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":131592,"dataFile":{"id":3092801,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/TE2SQ9/TCK9WV","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TE2SQ9/TCK9WV","filename":"Mazumder-2017-JPR-replication-package.tar.gz","contentType":"application/x-gzip","filesize":149886059,"description":"Untar file to run","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1607b3f9ad0-232331fe53bc","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"86eabf61fdab9e6f96c5f6ecaa89b6cc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"86eabf61fdab9e6f96c5f6ecaa89b6cc"}}}]}}}
