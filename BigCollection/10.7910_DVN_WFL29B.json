We examine whether France reoriented the allocation of its aid in Africa to reflect changing priorities in the 1990s. Using panel data, we compare the patterns in French aid allocation to African recipients during the period 1980-1989 with that during the period 1990-2000. We find that nearly all the same political, economic, diplomatic, and cultural variables that explain French ODA allocation during the Cold War apply in the second period as well, though to a slightly lesser degree. The predictive strength of the prior years' ODA commitments did increase in magnitude, suggesting that bureaucratic inertia increasingly exerts a formidable force in such decisions."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-09-27"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Simon Quinn.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68406,"dataFile":{"id":1544613,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Simon Quinn.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":130467,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:54149","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b4dbe819648d0d4de07317e17fb9badf","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b4dbe819648d0d4de07317e17fb9badf"}}}]}}}
