This cross-section study was designed to yield a  representative sample of eligible voters in Great Britain near the  time of the general election on February 28, 1974. As with other  surveys in the series, electors in Northern Ireland and the Scottish  Highlands and Islands were excluded from the sampling frame. Personal  interviews with 2,462 members of the British electorate took place in  two waves between March and May. Respondents answered questions  relating to their attitudes toward the general election and the  strength of their political opinions and interest. Respondents were  asked about their trust in government and their opinions of the  Conservative, Labour, Liberal, Scottish Nationalist, and Plaid Cymru  political parties (e.g., perceived differences among them, and  knowledge and perception of party position/record). Respondents were  also asked to reveal their past voting behavior (e.g., their first and  second choices in the general election, other parties considered,  choices in the 1970 and 1966 elections, frequency of discussion about  politics, and direction and strength of party identification).  Respondents were then asked for their views on the general election  results along a variety of dimensions. Respondents also identified  groups with too much or too little political power, as well as groups  with whom they themselves identified. They were asked to rate several  political parties and politicians and to express their views regarding  a range of social issues relating to domestic and foreign affairs,  including the mass media (e.g., attention to television and newspapers  and perceived bias in newspapers), opinions on prices, strikes in  general, the miners' strike, pensions, the Common Market,  nationalization, social services, Communists, devolution, income ta\nx  and wage controls, and Britain's dependency on other countries (i.e.,  the United States, Russia, France, Germany, and Australia).  Respondents were also asked to predict incomes, unemployment, and  Britain's future economic situation. Other sets of questions probed  for opinions on social mores and life satisfaction (e.g., life in  general, personal financial status, today's standards, local  government, change, and getting ahead). Background information  includes age, sex, marital status, employment status, socioeconomic  group, experience of unemployment in household, income, occupation,  degree of supervision, and responsibility in job (for self and  spouse). Information on father's vote, party choice, strength of party  support, occupation, employment status, and social grade is also included."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic
