(2) Imputed data was entered for certain  unknown items. The imputations for these items were based on the  available data for the responding facilities on the MFI with the same  ownership, type of service, and approximately the same bed size.  Mechanical imputations were based on such critical items as the number  of beds or residents in the facilities. (3) Due to reasons of  confidentiality, employment and financial information is not available  in this data collection, but it may be obtained in summary form from  the NCHS. (4) Superseding the Master Facilities List, the MFI has been  assembled since 1967. It has been updated since that time with a  continuing series of biennial surveys and with the Agency Reporting  System (ARS), which has been used to update the MFI between biennial  surveys. The primary purpose in adopting the ARS was to identify new  facilities. These could be determined by obtaining lists from state  agencies which regulate or control nearly all facilities in the  MFI. In addition to state agencies, the ARS uses lists collected by  health, welfare, or voluntary religio\nus organizations, publishers of  commercial directories, and federal agencies.
