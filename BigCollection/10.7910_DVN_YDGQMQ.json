This is a survey of 1,000 nationally representative American adults asked a subset of the full ANES battery both before and after the 2016 election. We selected questions from the ANES battery that represent the core of the ANES questionnaires. This data was produced by YouGov. A future release will include vote validation. \r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nYouGov interviewed 1643 respondents who were then matched down to a sample of 1000 to produce the final dataset. The respondents were matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, race, education, ideology, region, and political interest. The frame was constructed by stratified sampling from the full 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) sample with selection within strata by weighted sampling with replacements (using the person weights on the public use file). Data on voter registration status and turnout were matched to this frame using the November 2010 Current Population Survey.  Data on interest in politics and ideology were then matched to this frame from the 2007 Pew Religious Life Survey. The matched cases were weighted to the sampling frame using propensity scores. The matched cases and the frame were combined and a logistic regression was estimated for inclusion in the frame. The propensity score function included age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, ideology, and region. The propensity scores were grouped into deciles of the estimated propensity score in the frame and post-stratified according to these deciles.
