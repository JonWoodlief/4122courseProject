To that end, a survey of 512 municipal  police departments was conducted in the spring of 1996. The agencies  were asked to supply data for the current year as well as for 1994 and  1995. Information was collected on the existence of particular street  disorder ordinances, when such ordinances were passed, the number of  citations and arrests resulting from each ordinance, and whether the  ordinances were challenged in court. Data covered the following types  of street disorder: panhandling, open containers of alcohol, public  intoxication, disorderly conduct, sleeping in public places,  unregulated day labor solicitation, vending, dumpster diving, camping  in public, and juvenile curfews. Departments were also asked about  their written policies regarding certain types of street  disorder. Other departmental information includes location, number of personnel, and population of jurisdiction."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Street disorder is a growing topic of concern in  many American cities. Police departments, mayors, city councils, and  prosecutors are facing an increased demand for action on panhandling,  graffiti, camping in urban parks, sidewalk interference, excessive  noise, public urination, street drug and prostitution markets, and  loitering. This renewed interest in an old set of problems stems, in  part, from the ambitious efforts under way in virtually every major  city to revitalize central business districts and older commercial  strips. The introduction of community policing has also played a part  in bringing attention to this issue. Once officers began to ask, they  discovered that \"low-level crimes\" were very important to the  residents, small business owners, office workers, shoppers, and  tourists, who are the life blood of central cities. In addition,  research over the past 20 years related to the now well-known \"broken  windows\" theory has provided a firm intellectual foundation for  increased attention to quality-of-life issues. Despite the widespread  interest in street disorder, some cities have been hesitant to act  aggressively in this area for fear of expensive lawsuits. To give  local leaders guidance on how to carry out disorder enforcement  strategies within the constitutional guidelines established by the  courts, a survey of 512 municipal police departments was conducted in  the spring of 1996. The agencies were asked to supply data for the  current year as well as for 1994 and 1995. The project was designed to  answer three questions: (1) Do the large municipalities have local  ordinances on certain antisocial behaviors? (2) If so, how and to what  extent are these ordinances enforced? (3) What are the factors that affect enforcement?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To give local leaders guidance on how to carry out  disorder enforcement strategies within the constitutional guidelines  established by the courts, a survey of 512 municipal police  departments was conducted.
