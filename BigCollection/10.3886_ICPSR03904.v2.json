The survey gauged respondents' knowledge of which genetic  defects can be detected by the prenatal testing of a fetus, whether  genetic testing can predict heart attacks or detect a tendency to  develop depression and certain types of cancer, and whether gene  therapy can be used to correct many of the defects discovered through  gene testing. Attitudes toward prenatal genetic testing were examined,  including preferences for abortion in case of fetal defect, as well as  attitudes toward genetic testing of adults, genetic testing in the  workplace, and other aspects of genetic testing. Respondents reported  whether they or their partner ever had a prenatal genetic test or  received counseling for a prenatal test, their reasons for deciding to  have or not have a test, and whether anything happened to the  pregnancy as result of a test, e.g., abortion. In addition,  respondents were asked if they ever had themselves tested for a  genetic disease or received counseling for such tests, for which  conditions they were tested, whether they tested positive or negative,  with whom they shared the test results, and whether they lost a job,  lost health or life insurance, or had their insurance premiums  increased as a result of being tested. Sources of information for news  about science or health, trust in doctors to keep medical information  private, and confidence in the people running the government and  corporations that make and sell genetic tests constitute some of the  other topics covered by the survey. Background variables include sex,  age, race, Hispanic origin, employment status, union membership,  religious preference, religiosity, disability status and type of  disability, health insurance coverage, state and geographic region of residence, income, and education."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"genetics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"knowledge (awareness)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical technology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prenatal care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk factors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"testing and measurement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR XII.
