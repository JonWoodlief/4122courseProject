It contains considerable detail on other aspects of individuals and households, e.g., religion, wealth and years in the United States and Iowa. The Iowa State Census of 1915 was a complete sample of the residents of the state and the returns were written by census takers (assessors) on index cards. These cards were kept in the Iowa State Archives in Des Moines and were microfilmed in 1986 by the Genealogical Society of Salt Lake City. The census cards were sorted by county, although large cities (those having more than 25,000 residents) were grouped separately. Within each county or large city, records were alphabetized by last name and within last name by first name. This data set includes individual-level records for three of the largest Iowa cities (Des Moines, Dubuque, and Davenport; the Sioux City films were unreadable) and for ten counties that did not contain a large city.

This data set, however, takes as its universe only three of the largest Iowa cities (Des Moines, Dubuque, and Davenport; the Sioux City films were unreadable) and ten counties that did not contain a large city. The counties were chosen by grouping the ninety-nine counties in Iowa into four equal units by the mean educational levels of their adult population and then randomly taking three from each of the four groups. None of the counties contained a large city. The ten resulting counties were determined by the quality of the microfilm. These rural counties span the geography of the state: Clay and Lyon in the northwest, Mitchell in the north central, Johnson and Buchanan in the east central, Marshall in the central, Wayne in the south central, Adair and Montgomery in the southwest, and Carroll in the west central. In the urban sample, we sampled every-other family name on each roll of microfilm chosen for the sample. This means that ALL of the Jones would be done and all of the Goldschlagers, should those names appear. When a roll of microfilm is started, it is begun with the SECOND name on the film. The reason is that we d\no not know whether the first name on the film was left over from the previous film. The same thing applies to the LAST name on a film -- it was not taken. The underlying rationale for this is that the names are alphabetically arranged. With some care, family ties can be established (using name, age, sex, marital status, address and card number), but only if we know that we have all persons in the city (or county) with the same last name. On occasion the cards do not go in alphabetical order and we attempted to re-alphabetize the  order, continuing to take all persons having every other last name. For the rural sample, we sampled all names on each roll of microfilm chosen for the sample, and inferred familial relations as described for the urban sample. Altogether, the urban sample contains 26,768 observations or 5.5 percent of Iowa's population in large cities.
