For two decades, the American National Election Studies asked open-ended questions about political knowledge and coded answers using procedures that are neither reliable nor replicable and that were never shown to be optimally valid. Consequently, conclusions based on these widely used measures of the public's competence are in doubt. This paper presents several new and overdue methodological improvements: coding knowledge data using formal and specific coding rules based on a substantive rationale for the validity of the codes, recognizing partially correct answers, using multiple coders working independently, using machine coding, and testing reliability and validity. The new methods are an improvement because they are transparent and replicable and they produce valid and extremely reliable knowledge data. Further, machine coding produces codes nearly identical to those from a team of human coders, at much lower cost."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-05"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political knowledge, office recall, coding open-ended survey data, ANES"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Matthew DeBell. 2013. \"Harder Than It Looks: Coding Political Knowledge on the ANES.\"  Political Analysis (Autumn 2013) 21 (4): 393-406. <a href= \"http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/4/393\" target= \"_new\">article available here</a>"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.1093/pan/mpt010"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Political Analysis"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IQSS Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-05-26"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"}}]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Volume 21, Issue 4"}}}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"United States"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"This SPSS program flags instances of differences between codes assigned by the different human coders working on the coding project.
