Since that episode, United States bank supervisors have placed  more emphasis on monitoring the interest rate risk of commercial  banks. Economists at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System developed a duration-based economic value model (EVM) designed  to estimate the interest rate sensitivity of banks. The authors test  whether measures derived from the Federal Reserve's EVM are correlated  with the interest rate sensitivity of United States community  banks. The answer to this question is important because\nbank  supervisors rely on EVM measures for monitoring and risk-scoping  bank-level interest rate sensitivity. The authors find that the  Federal Reserve's EVM is indeed correlated with banks' interest rate  sensitivity and conclude that supervisors can rely on this tool to  help assess a bank's interest rate risk. These results are consistent  with prior research that finds the average interest rate risk at banks  to be modest, although the potential interaction between interest rate risk and other risk factors is not considered here."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Federal Reserve System"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"interest rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
