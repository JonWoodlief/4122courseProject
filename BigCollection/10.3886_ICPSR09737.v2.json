Synthetic drugs  investigated in the collection include PCP, ice, ecstasy, and speed,  while nonsynthetic drugs include alcohol, marijuana, heroin, cocaine,  and crack. Patterns of use for all of these drugs are explored.  Questions about specific drugs include whether the respondent had ever  used the drug, age first used, number of days in the past 30 days the  drug was used, whether the drug was used more than two times per week,  method of drug intake, and the drug used most often by the respondent  and by the respondent's friends. Additional variables include reasons  for preferring synthetic or nonsynthetic drugs, reasons the respondent  would discontinue use or switch to another drug, availability and cost  of certain drugs, and extent of involvement in selling, money handling,  and protection. Finally, demographic variables such as sex, ethnicity,  age, highest grade completed, employment activity in the past month,  geographical location, and subject source (criminal justice system or  drug treatment center) are included in the file. The unit of analysis is the individual drug user."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social influences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"socioeconomic status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
