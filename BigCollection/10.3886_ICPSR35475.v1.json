The project employed a random-digit-dial (RDD) telephone interview strategy targeting 3,200 landline and 800 cell phone completed adult interviews.  The sample was stratified by geographic location to ensure the Connecticut population was accurately represented in the final survey results. The telephone numbers within strata were disproportionately sampled to obtain a probability sample of households with landline telephones. The cell phone sample was divided into eight sampling strata according to the eight Connecticut counties. The telephone numbers within strata were sampled to obtain a probability sample of individuals with cell phones. Screening questions were designed in both the landline and cell phone questionnaires to restrict respondent overlap between these two sample frames. For the landline RDD frame, a random selection process was used to sample a single adult respondent among households with multiple adults. For both sample frames, if a selected household included multiple children, a single child was randomly selected and the respondent was asked questions regarding this child only."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data are not weighted, however the collection contains six weight variables that can be used in analysis: ADULT_WEIGHTS (Adult survey sample weights), ADULT_AGEWGT_RACE (Age-adjusted weights for analysis by adult's race/ethnicity), ADULT_AGEWGT_HRG (Age-adjusted weights for analysis by adult's Health Reference Group), CHILD_WEIGHTS (Child survey sample weights), CHILD_AGEWGT_RACE (Age-adjusted weights for analysis by child's race/ethnicity), and CHILD_AGEWGT_HRG (Age-adjusted weights for analysis by child's Health Reference Group).
