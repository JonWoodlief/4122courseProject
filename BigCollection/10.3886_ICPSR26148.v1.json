Opinions were sought on how well George W. Bush was handling the presidency, the economy, and the situation with Iraq. Views were sought on the Republican party, the Democratic party, how well Congress was handling it's job, the condition of the national economy, and whether the economy was getting better or worse. Respondents were asked how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, whether they were more likely to vote in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus in their state, who they wanted to see as the Democratic/Republican nominee, their level of support for this candidate, for whom they would vote if the election were held that day, and who they expected to actually win the election. Respondents gave their opinions of Democratic presidential nominees Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Republican presidential nominee John McCain.  Respondents also gave their opinions of Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton, and Cindy McCain. Other questions about the election and the candidates addressed who respondents wanted to see as the Democratic nominee's vice presidential running mate, the importance of the candidates' religious service attendance,  whether the method of nominating presidential candidates in caucuses and primaries produced the best candidates, and the  treatment of the candidates by the media.  Several questions about the Democratic and Republican party were asked and included questions such as which party came closer to sharing the moral values of the respondent, which party was more likely to improve health care, make sure the United States military defenses were strong, and make the right decisions regarding immigration, a strong economy, and the war in Iraq. Additional questions asked about tax rebate checks, foods containing genetically modified ingredients, household income, whether the respondent or any member of the respondent's household owned a handgun, and whether the respondent had a relative or family friend that was currently serving in Iraq. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, political party affiliation, political philosophy, household income, voter registration status and participation history, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush
