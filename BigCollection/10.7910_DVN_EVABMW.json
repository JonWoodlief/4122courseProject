These women are at high risk for maternal morbidity and mortality. Most recently, Raj (2009)  reported estimates of the effects of child marriage on poor fertility outcomes in India.  However, this study had several methodological problems. Since large resources are currently  being devoted to these issues, it is important to have accurate information. Hence, we improve  the methods of Raj (2009). We find there is less consistency in the differences between adult  and child marriages for fertility related outcomes than is reported in Raj (2009). We also find  that the differences may be largely functions of marriage duration and not of only having had a  child marriage. We identify two policy initiatives for improving outcomes for young adult  women in child marriages, and these are reducing sterilization and increasing contraception  usage."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Child marriage, fertility, women's health, maternal mortality"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-05-06"},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Sample survey"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"India"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Ezaz_Sanghavi_2011","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61279,"categories":["R Code for Replication"],"dataFile":{"id":2296105,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Ezaz_Sanghavi_2011","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":74280,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:67629","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"db7a04c89df86452f5a993c559a77776","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"db7a04c89df86452f5a993c559a77776"}}},{"description":"","label":"How To Access Data.docx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61279,"categories":["Instructions for Data Acquisition"],"dataFile":{"id":2296106,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"How To Access Data.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":11886,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:67630","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0b248554cda3bbd4bcad2e90972f2a57","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0b248554cda3bbd4bcad2e90972f2a57"}}},{"description":"","label":"Sanghavi Ezaz Replication Paper.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61279,"categories":["Replication Paper"],"dataFile":{"id":2296107,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Sanghavi Ezaz Replication Paper.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":174292,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:67640","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"85b08db10a88ae4da906b36f95245961","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"85b08db10a88ae4da906b36f95245961"}}}]}}}
