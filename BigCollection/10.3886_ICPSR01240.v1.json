Conversely, when the government  runs a surplus, it can retire that debt. For the past three years, the  federal government has recorded budget surpluses, and both the White  House Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget  Office project that these surpluses will increase for at least the  next decade. If these projections prove to be accurate, the $3.5  trillion of publicly held federal debt could be eliminated by around  2010. This article, which was written prior to the\nupdated estimates  published in January 2001, assesses the likelihood that these  projected surpluses will materialize, and consequently eliminate the  public debt, by comparing previous budget projections with actual  outcomes. The authors show that the long-term budget projections have  not provided a useful indicator of actual experience. Principally,  these errors occur because of changes in macroeconomic conditions or  unforeseen legislative actions, which both result in unanticipated  increases or decreases in revenues or outlays. Not surprisingly, the  projections have proven to be less reliable the longer the projection  horizon. Moreover, over the period of available data, the projections  have been biased upward, i.e., the actual deficits have been larger  than projected. Accordingly, the authors suggest that prospects for eliminating the public debt may be overstated."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"federal budget surplus"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national debt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public confidence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
