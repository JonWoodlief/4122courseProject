Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions about the European Union (EU), including sources of information about the EU and whether their country had benefited from being an EU member. Respondents were asked questions concerning citizenship and their overall feeling of belonging, such as what was most important to them: family, friendship, work, the arts/culture, politics, health, or money. Respondents were asked how important the following values were to them: rule of law, respect for human life, human rights, individual freedom, democracy, tolerance, peace, or solidarity. Respondents were asked if they agreed that the State intervened too much in their lives, criminals needed help and understanding, immigrants were a threat to their way of life, economic growth must be a priority even if it affects the environment, and that free competition was the best guarantee for economic prosperity. Respondents were also asked if they'd be willing to learn one or more foreign language and what would be the motivation for doing so (i.e., to use on holidays abroad, to get a better job, to be able to understand people from other cul\ntures, or for personal satisfaction), if they'd be interested or involved in the sports, arts and culture, music, and lifestyles of other countries in the EU and in countries outside of the EU, toward which country they felt the greatest affinity, whether the United States and the EU played a positive or negative role regarding peace in the world, fighting terrorism, growth of the world's economy, the fight against poverty in the world, and the protection of the environment. Additional questions focused on fraud and whether respondents had read or seen anything about fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, or counterfeiting of goods in their country, in other countries of the EU, in the countries which are candidates to join the EU, or elsewhere in the world. Respondents were asked what type of fraud worried them the most (e.g., hacking, pirating software, illegal data trading, counterfeiting of goods, commercial fraud like cheating on prices, weights, and goods, customs fraud, VAT fraud, or misappropriation of aids and grants), how well the media informed those in the EU about various types of fraud in the other countries of the EU as well as in their respective country, and whether using the police force, customs services, taxation authority, courts, private auditing firms, or the media was the most effective way to fight the EU and its budget from being defrauded. Respondents were also asked questions regarding the European Parliament, specifically how many European Parliament elections they voted in and if they were going to vote in the next one, how much impact the European Parliament had on their everyday lives, and whether the European Parliament election campaign should mainly focus on agriculture, environment, employment, immigration, education, foreign policy, enlargement of the EU, or the rights of the EU citizen. Those queried were also asked if they were interested in knowing more about the European Parliament whether via the television, radio, Internet, or newspapers. Background information includes gender, age, marital status, level of education, current occupation, household income, who contributed most to the household income, whether the respondent resided in a rural area or village, a small town, or a large town, and how much toward the left or right did the respondent consider their political views."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizenship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic growth"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Parliament"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European unification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fraud"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social values"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
