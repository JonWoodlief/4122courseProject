To fill this gap, a database consisting of 10,137 football players who participated in the FIFA World Cup (1930-2018) was created. In order to count the number of migrant footballers in national teams over time, we critically reflect on the term migrant and the commonly used foreign-born proxies in mainstream migration research. A foreign-born approach to migrants overlooks historical-geopolitical changes like the redrawing of international boundaries and colonial relationships, and tends to shy away from citizenship complexities, leading to an overestimation of the number of migrant footballers in a database. Therefore, we offer an alternative approach that through historical contextualization with an emphasis on citizenship, results in more accurate data on migrant footballers--contextual-nationality approach. By comparing outcomes, a foreign-born approach seems to indicate an increase in the volume of migrant footballers since the mid-1990s, while the contextual-nationality approach illustrates that the presence of migrant footballers is primarily a reflection of trends in international migration"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-01-14"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences","Other"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Citizenship"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"History"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Cup"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Migration"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"International Football"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gijs van Campenhout, Jacco van Sterkenburg and Gijsbert Oonk, 'Who Counts as a Migrant Footballer?
