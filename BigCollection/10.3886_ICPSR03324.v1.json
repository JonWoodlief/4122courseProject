The principal  investigators explored how police officers, school teachers, and  vocational rehabilitation counselors decided what was fair and right  in individual cases and how this assessment affected the delivery of  governmental services. The data in this collection consist of  street-level work stories or narratives, semi-structured entry and  exit interviews, and a structured questionnaire. Participants from the  aforementioned job categories were drawn from select southwest and  midwest United States cities over a period of three years (1996-1999).  Part 1 includes the quantitative data from the structured questionnaire.  Part 2 includes transcripts of the narratives and interviews. The  entry interview was designed to gather background information on the  participants and to explain and schedule the story collection process.  Participants were queried about their work history, current job, and  relations with citizen-clients, coworkers, and supervisors. They were  asked to describe their various personal, professional, and group  identities and how their social identities related to those of the  citizens with whom they interacted. They were also asked to describe  any critical incidents in the history of their agency, such as a  public scandal or change of administration, that influenced their work  environment. At the conclusion of the entry interview, the  participants were given instructions and materials for the narratives.  The participants were asked to write down a rough outline of two or  three different stories describing situations that took place within  their agency. These stories were to focus on instances when the  participants' perception of \"fairness or unfairness\" impacted their  decision-making in encounters with citizen-clients or with the  agency. The narratives were collected during a scheduled meeting  between the researcher and participant. The researcher asked the  participant to tell his or her stories, which were tape-recorded.  During the initial storytelling, the researchers interrupted as little  as possible, asking questions at the conclusion to encourage the story  teller to fill in missing or unelaborated details. The tape-recorded  stories were transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were lightly  edited for clarity and to introduce the observations added in response  to researcher probes. The exit interview involved a structured  questionnaire and a brief open-ended interview. The questionnaire  data were not intended to allow for statistical inference but to  describe the participants. The questionnaire asked direct questions  about discretion and justice as well as a series of standard  questions on task authority, task variety, the frequency of work  expectations, the applicability and clarity of rules, and the  percentage of time spent wor\nking directly with citizen-clients.  Participants were queried about the adequacy of resources, work load,  job satisfaction, and perceptions of fairness at work. They were also  asked questions on ideology and political orientation, as well as  hypothetical questions regarding the distribution of rules. The exit  interview involved three open-ended questions: What the word  \"justice\" meant to participants, whether participants felt there  were groups in America that were treated unfairly, and if any of the rules or procedures at work struck participants as unfair."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"bureaucracy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil service"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"counselors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government agencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government employees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police citizen interactions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police community relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police departments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher student relationship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teachers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vocational rehabilitation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR VIII.A.
