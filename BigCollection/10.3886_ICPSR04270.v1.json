The data capture various characteristics of the firms relating to each one's level and order of integration into the production of fabrics and garments and into retail. Part 1 of the study contains the data obtained from the initial screening interviews administered to each firm by phone to determine the prevalence and nature of integration present in its operations. This information was used to determine which one of the four study questionnaires would be administered to each firm during the final interview. Each questionnaire produced four datasets containing (in this order):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>general questions</li>\n<li>contracts</li>\n<li>lock in, switching costs, and temporal specificity</li>\n<li>product information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Questionnaire 1 (Parts 2-5) was administered to the firms for which the following four scenarios was true: (1) garment production and retail occurred at the same time at the establishment, and both garment production and fabric production took place at the same time at the establishment, (2) garment production and retail occurred simultaneously at the establishment, but fabrics were not produced in-house, (3) garment production occurred before retail while garment and fabric production were simultaneous at the establishment, and (4) garment and fabric production that occurred simultaneously at the establishment but retail operations not performed in-house (i.e. did not own or rent its own retail stores). Questionnaire 2 (Parts 6-9) was completed by the firms for which the following two scenarios were true: (1) garment production was subsequent to fabric production, and garment production was started prior to retail, or (2) garment production was started prior to retail, and the firm did not produce any of its own fabrics. Questionnaire 3 (Parts 10-13) was given to the firms for which the following three scenarios were true: (1) garment production began simultaneously with fabric production but not at the onset, and for which retail started subsequent to both garment and fabric production, (2) both fabric production and retail had started subsequent to garment production, and (3) garment production started before fabric production, and the firm did not perform in-house retail operations. Questionnaire 4 (Parts 14-17) was administered to firms for which the following two scenarios were true: (1) garment production was subsequent to fabric production, but in-house retail operations were not performed, or (2) there was no fabric production or in-house retail operations. Each of the four questionnaires contained an identical screening section (in addition to the screening information found in Part 1) in order to ensure that the appropriate questionnaire was administered during the interview. Specific questions regarding each firm's management, sister companies, products, operations, and other firm-level characteristics varied depending on the questionnaire. However, sections eight and nine, dealing with fabrics and fabric suppliers, were identical across all questionnaires.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"businesses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"clothing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"industrial production"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"management"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"manufacturing industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nondurable goods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"organizational structure"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"product information"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"production levels"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"products"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retail industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retail trade"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.B.
