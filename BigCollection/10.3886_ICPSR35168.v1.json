The supplement, on the topic of public participation in the arts in the United States, was sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>\n\n<p>The CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population aged 15 years old or older living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of thi\ns population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. The basic CPS data are provided on labor force activity for the week prior to the survey. In addition, CPS provides respondents' demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, marital status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and industry.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the basic CPS questions, interviewers asked supplementary questions on public participation in the arts of two randomly selected household members aged 18 or older from about one-half of the sampled CPS households. Interviews were conducted during the period of July 15-21, 2012. The supplement contained questions about the sampled member's participation in various artistic activities from July 1, 2011 through July 1, 2012. If the selected person had a spouse or partner, then the respondent answered questions on behalf of their spouse/partner. Therefore, the spouse/partner responses are proxies. If a respondent was answering for themselves and on behalf of their spouse or partner, the respondent and spouse/partner questions followed the same path through the instrument. Spouse/partner questions were asked on core participation (Core 1 or Core 2), leisure activities (Module D), and the first four questions of Module A. The total sample size of the 2012 SPPA was 35,735 American adults, ages 18 and over.</p>\n\n<p>The 2012 SPPA included two core components: a questionnaire used in previous years to ask about arts attendance; and a new, experimental module on arts attendance. In addition, the survey included five modules designed to capture other types of arts participation as well as participation in other leisure activities. Respondents were randomly assigned to either of the survey's core questionnaires, and then were randomly assigned to two of the remaining five SPPA modules. Questions were asked about the type of artistic activity, the frequency of participation, training and exposure, musical and artistic preferences, school-age socialization, and computer and device usage related to artistic information. The topics were separated into the five modules (each module was administered to only a portion of the sampled cases):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Module A: Other Attendance and Music Preferences (reading, film, or sporting event attendance; other live performances; and music listening preferences)</li>\n<li>Module B: Accessing Art through Media (using media for participation in artistic events and frequency of participation in past year)</li>\n<li>Module C: Creating Arts through Media (participation in certain types of other leisure or artistic activities, public artistic performances, and using media to share activities in past year)</li>\n<li>Module D: Creating, Performing, and Other Activities (sport activities, other art activities, and musical performance activities in past year)</li>\n<li>Module E: Arts Learning (art related lessons or classes, respondent age during lessons/classes, location of lessons/classes, respondents' parents' education, and the participation of the respondents' school age children)</li>\n</ul>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of the SPPA supplement was to examine American adults' participation in the arts and other leisure activities."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The SPPA supplement was administered to about one-half of the eligible CPS households.

This previous release has been revised to reflect changes in how the 2012 SPPA counted \"interviews.\" Specifically, the Census revisions count \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"don't know\" as interviews, in accordance with estimates generated from the 2008 and earlier waves of the SPPA. Alternatively, the September 2013 estimates provided by the U.S. Census Bureau had included respondents who \"refused to answer\" as interviews--an action that clouded comparisons with previous SPPA waves.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the 2012 SPPA estimates were unaffected by these revisions. And of those that were affected, most changes to participation rates were marginal, often in the range of 1-2 tenths of a percentage point.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Users are strongly encouraged to refer the CPS User Guide (produced by the Census Bureau), which contains additional detailed technical documentation regarding the CPS study design, sampling frame used, and response rates. Users are also encouraged to read the SPPA User Guide (produced by the Urban Institute) for information about the SPPA, including the design, dealing with missing respondent data, weights, and multi-variable analysis.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The universe statements for each variable are defined in the basic or supplement record layouts found in Attachment 6 and 7, respectively, of the CPS User Guide.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The SPPA provides estimates for 32 states: Alabama; California; Colorado, Connecticut; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Iowa; Kansas; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; Michigan; Minnesota; Missouri; Nebraska; Nevada; New Jersey; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Ohio; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Carolina; South Dakota; Texas; Virginia; Washington; West Virginia; and Wyoming.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the SPPA can reliably supply arts participation estimates for 11 metropolitan areas: Boston-Worchester-Manchester, MA-NH; Chicago-Naperville-Michigan City, IL-IN; Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; Denver-Aurora-Boulder, CO; Detroit-Warren-Flint, MI; Los Angeles-Long Beach-Riverside, CA; Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Miami Beach, FL; New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA; Philadelphia-Camden-Vineland, PA-NJ-DE-MD; San Jose-Francisco-Oakland, CA; and Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Users cannot do analysis that combines variables from Core 1 and Core 2 because respondents were assigned to either complete Core 1 or Core 2, but never Core 1 and Core 2. Also, analyses cannot use variables from more than two modules in the same runs since\nno respondent answered more than 2 modules. So doing such analyses can raise sample size concerns.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Users must use appropriate weights to analyze the SPPA 2012 data. For online analysis, subsets of the data were created, each with the variables that need to be used with the 1 SPPA weight variable. The Part 2 dataset contains CPS variables and SPPA Core 1 questions including those about asked respondents' and their spouse/partners' artistic activity and frequency of participation in the past year. The Part 3 dataset contains CPS variables and SPPA Core 2 experimental questions including those about asked respondents' and their spouse/partners' artistic activity and frequency of participation in the past year. The Part 4 dataset contains CPS variables and SPPA modules A1 and D questions that asked respondents and their spouse/partners about reading, film, and sporting event attendance as well as creating, performing, and other artistic activities in the past year. The Part 5 dataset contains CPS variables and SPPA Module A2 questions that asked respondents about other live performances attendances and music listening preferences in the past year. The Part 6 dataset contains CPS variables and Modules B, C, and E questions including those that asked respondents about accessing art through media and frequency of participation through the media in the past year, creating arts through the media in the past year, and participation in arts education in the past year.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The \"PC\" variables (e.g. JAZZ_PC) should be used to match the SPPA 2012 published results.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>Information regarding data processing for this data collection is in the \"Codebook Notes\" page(s) in the ICPSR Codebook.
