This antioxidant has been known to reduce the production of free radicals and limit pro-oxidative induced chemical reactions that cause both cell damage and oxidative stress. In relation to the human body and the unimpeded production of free radicals (oxidative stress), recent studies have shown that the Flavivirus genus, which includes the West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Tick-Borne Encephalitis virus, Yellow Fever virus, and Zika virus has shown promising results of infection reversal after vitamin c supplementation. The biological mechanism behind such reversal is believed to be contingent upon immunity support, and most recently, oxidative stress reduction during infection. The idea behind oxidative stress reduction revolves around the belief that vitamin c can temporally control genome RNA capping and replication, by inhibition and donating elections, causing an antioxidant effect. These findings suggest that vitamin c has an effect on the Flavivirus in vivo with regards to immunity support and replication inhibition.
