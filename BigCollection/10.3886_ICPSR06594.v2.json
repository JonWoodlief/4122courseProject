Standard topics included President Bill  Clinton's handling of his job, foreign policy, a\nnd the economy.  Respondents were also asked for their opinions of Hillary Clinton and  her influence on the president's decisions. In addition, the issues of  health care and the Whitewater deal were addressed in detail.  Respondents were asked how much they worried about not finding good  medical care and not having enough health insurance, whether they  thought that the health care plan Clinton proposed would bring about  the changes needed in the health care system, whether the plan was  fair to people like them, and, if Clinton's plan was adopted, whether  the quality of the health care they and their family received would  improve. Questions on the Whitewater deal probed respondents' beliefs  on how important an issue it was to the nation, whether President  Clinton participated in a cover-up of the Whitewater situation, and  whether Republicans in Congress criticized President Clinton about  Whitewater because they cared about ethics, or because they were  looking for political gain. Respondents were also asked for their  opinions regarding which nation posed the greatest threat to world  peace, and the degree to which they trusted Japan, Germany, Great  Britain, China, and Russia. Background information on respondents  includes voter registration status, household composition, vote choice  in the 1992 presidential election, political party, political  orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
