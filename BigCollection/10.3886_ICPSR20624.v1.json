A research team member contacted a designated Ohio Department of Youth Services (DYS) official on a weekly basis to receive a list of youths who met eligibility requirements.  Youth were then sent an invitation letter from the study team.  Eligible participants received follow-up phone calls from the research team inviting them to participate. The final sample included 175 youths aged 12 to 19 years who had a presumptive release date within the next 60 days and were placed on the mental health caseload. All data from youth and parents/guardians were collected by a Columbus Children's Hospital research assistant over the telephone. Ohio Department of Youth Services also collected information on re-arrests and recidivism from parole officers throughout Ohio. Interview data were collected in 2005 and 2006 from youth at four time points: one month pre-release, one month post-release, three months post-release, and six months post-release.  Parents of children 18 and over were not contacted for this study. However, the researchers collected interview\ndata from parents/guardians of youth under 18 at three time points: one month post-release, three months post-release, and six months post-release. Youth over 18 received a $40 gift card for each completed interview, with a maximum total of $160.  Youth under 18 received a $20 gift card for each completed interview with a maximum total of $80, while their caregivers received a $20 gift card for each completed interview for a maximum total of $60. A variety of standardized measures were completed, including the Voice Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV, a computerized, structured interview covering all major psychiatric disorders. Data were gathered regarding the frequency and timing of re-arrest rates and parole violation, and whether subjects received mental health care treatment following their release. Demographic variables were also collected."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A total of 3,531 variables were gathered from the Ohio Department of Youth Services (DYS) and through the administration of a variety of standardized surveys and interview protocols. The main categories of variables include variables relating to arrest history and recidivism, variables relating to the mental health of subjects, variables relating to the administration of mental health treatment and health insurance coverage post-release, and demographic variables. Variables collected through the DYS primarily include re-arrests and recidivism from parole officers throughout Ohio.  Specifically, these comprise whether or not a youth was absent from parole but not formally re-arrested for the six-month post-release period as well as data on re-arrest and re-incarceration. Variables relating to youths' legal history, including the number of previous arrests and total number of months that the youth had ever been incarcerated in a correctional facility, were also gathered through the DYS. Variables related to mental health were gathered primarily through the administration of the Voice Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-IV (DISC-IV), a computerized, structured interview covering all major psychiatric disorders, and the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MAYSI-2), a measure of psychopathology that the youths completed at admission to DYS. Variables measuring functional outcomes and mental health symptoms in the community were created using the the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS), a standard measure of adaptive functioning for a mental health population. Variables pertaining to mental health service utilization were composed using the utilized portions of the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents (SACA), yielding variables documenting inpatient and residential services, drug and alcohol services, outpatient services, and psychotropic medication usage.  Variables relating to health insurance coverage were created using the the insurance and public program participation questions from the National Survey of American Families (NSAF) to assess coverage during each post-release interview. Finally, demographic variables include age, gender, and race."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"delinquent behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile recidivists"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postrelease programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prisoner reentry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rehabilitation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social reintegration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"youthful offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
