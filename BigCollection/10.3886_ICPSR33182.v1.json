Respondents were asked how much attention they paid to the 2010 election campaigns in New York, how likely it was that they would vote in the 2010 election in November, whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Andrew Cuomo, Carl Paladino, Charles Schumer, Jay Townsend, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Joe DioGuardi, who they would vote for in the 2010 gubernatorial and Senate elections, and whether they would vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in the 2010 House of Representatives election. Respondents were queried on whether they approved of the way Barack Obama was handling his job as president, David Paterson as governor, Schumer and Gillibrand as senators, Cuomo as State Attorney General, and Michael Bloomberg as mayor of New York City. Respondents were also asked whether they approved of the way the New York state Legislature in Albany was handling its job, how they would rate the condition of the New York state economy, what they were most angry about, whether they thought police should have the power to request proof of citizenship in order to deal with the problem of illegal immigration, what their view was on abortion and same-sex marriage, how common they thought corruption was in the New York state government, whether they thought the Democratic party has too much power in the state government and whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the Tea Party movement. Information was collected on how serious of a problem respondents thought the current budget of New York state was, who they thought was mostly to blame for the current budget problems, what steps they thought should be taken to balance the budget, what state funded services they thought should be cut, and whether they thought it would be a good idea to layoff state employees. Respondents were asked if Cuomo or Paladino were elected governor whether they thought the economy would get better or worse, whether they thought that they would raise taxes or lower taxes, whether they thought they have the right kind of experience to be an effective governor, whether they thought they had the right temperament and personality to be a good governor, whether they thought of them as Albany insiders, and how they thought the media was treating them. Additionally respondents were asked whether they thought that New York City was more safe from crime than it was a year ago, how they would rate the job the police in New York City were doing, whether they or an\ny member of their immediate family had been the victim of a crime in New York City, how concerned they were that they or someone in their household might lose their job, whether their family's financial situation was better or worse than it was four years ago, and whether they supported the Tea Party movement.

rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, and voter registration
