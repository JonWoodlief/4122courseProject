Data have been collected on the Tecumseh population in southeast Michigan for over 30 years, beginning with a 1957 canvass of all households and adding all newcomers to the community until 1970, after which only previous residents have been followed. The Tecumseh project has conducted over 80 different studies, including both disease-specific investigations and studies concerned with the prevalence and incidence of disease in the\ncommunity. The core data file for the years 1959-1969 contains data collected in Round I: 1959-1960, Round II: 1962-1965, and Round III: 1967-1969 (referred to as the Cardiovascular Studies I, II, and III, and the General Surveillance Study II). These data include information taken from baseline medical history interviews, medical examinations, clinical measurements, laboratory work, and electrocardiograms. Mortality status of all persons at the time of attempted or actual contact in Round III is also provided. The major variable groups include demographic information, family history of major diseases, systematic review of present and past symptoms and conditions, smoking and drinking habits, physical examinations, measurements and laboratory work, and electrocardiogram results."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"communities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR XII.
