Data are available for both public and private  two-year and four-year institutions. This data collection contains  information about the residence and migration of college students  elicited as part of the VII package. The package was distributed to  approximately 30,408 colleges and universities and their branches  located in the United States and its outlying territories. The data  provide information on full-time and part-time students based on their  in-state, out-of-state, and foreign status. Only students enrolled at  an institution for the first time at each of the following class  levels were reported: (1) undergraduate, (2) graduate, (3)  first-professional, and (4) unclassified. Variables provide  information on enrollment, institution name, state of residence, and  part-time and full-time status. Information regarding institution  name, enrollment number, accreditation type, sex, and race of students is included in this study as well."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"college students"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"graduate students"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population migration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school enrollments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.

The first 12 columns are recorded in the data fields  marked 1 thru 12 (positions 90-149) on the layout and have a part and  line number (positions 79-84) as shown on the survey form with  position 84 being a zero. The 13th column on that line on the survey  form is recorded in the data field marked 1 (positions 90-94) of a  \"trailer\" record with the remainder of the data fields (positions  95-149) blank. That \"trailer\" record has an identical part and line  number to its \"header\" but the sub number (position 84) is a 1.
