Respondents were queried regarding President Bill Clinton's handling of foreign policy, the economy, health care reform, and the situation involving United States troops in Somalia. The poll also addressed the potential impact of Clinton's health care reform plan on the quality of care and the amount paid for care, policy options with respect to the United States' involvement in Somalia, support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, financial aid to Russia, theories regarding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the existence and activity of angels. Background information on respondents includes vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, political party, political orientation, religious preference, attendance at religious services, education, age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, and family\nincome. Respondents interviewed on October 7 were asked about President Clinton's address to the nation on Somalia, and whether they thought sending more troops to Somalia would insure that all United States troops could be safely withdrawn in the near future."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
