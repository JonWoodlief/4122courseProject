This survey, fielded  January 25-26, 2000, was a call-back of the January 15-17, 2000,  cohort from CBS NEWS NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY POLL #1, JANUARY 2000  (ICPSR 2919), and was conducted to assess respondent views on the  upcoming presidential election and New Hampshire  primaries. Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President  Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency as well as their  opinions of New Hampshire governor Jeanne Shaheen and her handling of  the state. Those polled were asked whether they intended to vote in  the New Hampshire presidential primaries to be held February 1, 2000,  and what their opinions were of Democratic candidates Vice President  Al Gore and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, and Republican  candidates Texas governor George W. Bush, Arizona senator John McCain,  publisher Steve Forbes, radio talk show host Alan Keyes, Family  Research Council president Gary Bauer, and Utah senator Orrin  Hatch. Respondents were queried as to which candidate they intended to  vote for and which candidate they thought would win, and whether they  had ever considered voting in the opposing political party's  primary. Respondents were further asked what they thought about the  candidates, which candidate could be trusted to keep his word, to  understand the complicated problems a president has to deal with, and  to say what he believes, and whether they thought any candidate had  made a decision as a direct result of a major campaign  contribution. Additional questions relating to the presidential  campaigns probed respondent views on the influence of television ads,  which candidate's health-care plan respondents supported, whether  respondents had been contacted by a campaign, whether they had seen  any of the candidates in person, and whether they knew who won the  Iowa caucuses. Respondents who had shifted their support to a  different candidate since their original interview were asked why they  had done so. Their views were also sought on whether Bradley's medical  condition, arrhythmia, would affect his ability to serve effectively  as president. Additional survey items focused on abortion, the most  important problems facing the country, and whether homosexuals should  be permitted to serve in the military. Background information on  respondents includes age, gender, political party, political  orientation, voter registration and participation history, marital  status, education, religion, race, Hispanic origin, household income, computer and Internet access, and military service."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bauer,
