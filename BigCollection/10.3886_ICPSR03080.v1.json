The first, a grantee component, consisted  of agencies that had received funding during 1995. A grantee list,  created in April 1996, was obtained from applicant records from the  grants management database from the Office of Community Oriented  Policing Services (COPS). Specifically, COPS provided databases for  the following programs: (1) Funding Accelerated for Small Towns  (FAST), (2) Accelerated Hiring, Education, and Deployment (AHEAD), (3)  Universal Hiring Program (UHP), and (4) Making Officer Redeployment  Effective (MORE). These databases included, among other things, the  applicant's originating agency identifier (ORI) and the status for  each submitted application. An application was considered \"funded\" if  the status variable indicated that the application was accepted by  COPS for funding by December 31, 1995. Because a single agency could  have had applications accepted in any of the multiple programs, the  various databases were flattened so that each agency represented a  single record. An agency was added to the grantee component of the  sampling frame if at least one of its applications was deemed  \"funded.\" The second component of the sampling frame was a nongrantee  component, which consisted of agencies that appeared potentially  eligible but remained unfunded through 1995. To determine the  nongrantee component of the sampling frame, a master list of  candidates for inclusion as eligible nongrantees was compiled in July  1998 consisting of agencies pulled from the following sources: (1) the  National Crime Information Center (NCIC), (2) the Uniform Crime  Reporting (UCR) Program, and (3) the National Law Enforcement Agency  List (NLEAL). NLEAL, which was a subset of the Justice Agency List,  contained the most comprehensive list of law enforcement agencies in  existence at any point between June 1993 and June 1997. To reduce this  master list, \"clearly ineligible\" agencies were removed using various  automated algorithms. Researchers also used a combination of visual  inspection and computer matching on the agencies from the NCIC and UCR  to further eliminate \"clearly ineligible\" agencies\n. This reduced  master list was then merged with the flattened grantee list and any  agency appearing on both lists was removed from the nongrantee master  list. The resulting agencies from the reduced master list (making up  the nongrantee component), along with the grantee list (making up the grantee component) comprised the sampling frame."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include agency identification number,  type of agency, FIPS code, Office of Community Policing Service  eligibility, COPS funding status, total number of full- and part-time  employees, total number of full- and part-time sworn employees,  population, and sheriff agencies' eligibility for grants, based on one  of three criteria: (1) the sheriff agency already had a Community  Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant, (2) another sheriff agency in  the same state received a COPS grant, or (3) the sheriff agency was  located in a state where sheriff agencies were known to have law enforcement authority."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community policing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime control programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement agencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policies and procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
