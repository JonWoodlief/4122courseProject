Google Classroom is one such tool that is free of cost and has gained popularity within a short span of time. The main purpose of the study is to assess teachers’ perception on the effectiveness of Google Classroom. The study is carried out through a qualitative research design. The sample of the study, which uses semi-structured interview method, consists of 12 higher education teachers who have implemented Google Classroom for at least one semester in their classroom. The data acquired has been put through a comprehensive analysis by coding and categorizing the data through NVivo. Findings revealed that teachers perceive it as only a facilitation tool that can be used for document management and basic classroom management, without having a significant impact on teaching methodologies. The responses of the teachers indicate that lack of user-friendly interface is the main reason for its inefficiency. Further studies can be conducted by taking the students’ perspective into account."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-08-31"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://prizrenjournal.com/index.php/PSSJ/article/view/39"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"issn"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2616-387X"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Journal, Prizren"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-04"}]}},"files":[{"label":"7.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":140955,"dataFile":{"id":3213592,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/FJVYI4/BWYKSA","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FJVYI4/BWYKSA","filename":"7.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":297811,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165a561ec80-6059ebeccc24","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"cc64996de7420cf678f0932b41ce3a36","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"cc64996de7420cf678f0932b41ce3a36"}}}]}}}
