The purposes of the evaluation were to describe the  activities of the RSAT program and the relationship between program  participants and success in the new program. There were five primary  evaluation questions: (1) Were the participants appropriate? (2) Was  the staff trained to deliver the planned services? (3) How did service  delivery vary over time? (4) Did the participants make timely  progress? and (5) What organizational factors changed service delivery  and participant progress? Residents were admitted to the RSAT program  and its comparison group on the basis of three criteria: (1) the  resident was not a sex offender, (2) he had a known substance abuse  history, and (3) he was expected to be released within one year. Youth  in the RSAT program underwent intensive substance abuse  psycho-education and relapse prevention in addition to the treatment  provided in the Maxey Model. Intake data from the Family Independence  Agency Information System (Part 1) were gathered for youths who  entered Maxey between 1995 and 1998. These data were used to determine  if significant differences existed between the RSAT and comparison  groups. Additional data were collected through a client survey (Parts  2 and 3), which included questions that evaluated youth satisfaction  with services and their predictions for success. Variables in Part 1  include program admission date, whether the youth was a sex offender,  substance abuse history, the group and wing to which the youth  belonged, age of first offense, age of admission to Maxey, offense  class, number of arrests, number of previous placements, number of  truancies, legal status, and date of first and second  offense. Demographic variables include race, age, marital status, and  county. Variables in Parts 2 and 3 assess the youth's opinions about  school, food, group sessions, hall staff, family sessions, family  visits, the overall program at Maxey, teachers, police, and  judges. Additional variables include last grade of school completed,  expected educational goal upon leaving Maxey, family substance abuse history, and prevalence of substance abuse in neighborhood."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was an evaluation of a Residential  Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) program intended to reduce substance  abuse and recidivism among youth placed at the W.J.
