If the constitution emancipates slaves it may also repeal that law and place the poor of every complexion on the same basis. It is supposed that a slave, being the property of his master, cannot gain an inhabitancy during the period of his slavery, so as to charge the town where he resided, in case of indigence. And when by virtue of the constitution he is said to emerge from slavery and take rank with citizens and freemen, he was in the army and not resident in the state - and whether birth or term of residence are necessary to create inhabitancy, so as to charge the town with maintenance, we have not the means of information.
