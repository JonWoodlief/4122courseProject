To shed light on this question, we randomized access to noninterest-bearing bank accounts among two types of self-employed individuals in rural Kenya: market vendors (who are mostly women) and men working as bicycle taxi drivers. Despite large withdrawal fees, a substantial share of market women used the accounts, were able to save more, and increased their productive investment and private expenditures. We see no impact for bicycle taxi drivers. These results imply significant barriers to savings and investment for market women in our study context."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Entrepreneurship"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Microfinance"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Savings"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Self-employment"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-04-09"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Administrative data, entrepreneurial logbooks kept by respondents, survey data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"STATA"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"13"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["http://www.econ.ucla.edu/pdupas/savingsconstraints.pdf"]},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/app.5.1.163"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Kenya"},"state":{"typeName":"state","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Western Kenya"},"city":{"typeName":"city","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bumala Town"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individual"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Market vendors (mostly women) and bicycle taxi drivers (all men) without an already existing savings account"]},{"typeName":"dataCollector","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"K-Rep Development Agency, Bumala Financial Services Association"},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"392 individuals were selected in and around Bumala Town among market vendors and bicycle taxi drivers if they did not have an already existing savings accound (either with Bumala FSA or some other formal bank).
