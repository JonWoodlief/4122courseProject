The goal of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) is to meet the needs of those engaged in broadly cross-national research by maximizing the comparability of income inequality data while maintaining the widest possible coverage across countries and over time. The SWIID’s income inequality estimates are based on thousands of reported Gini indices from hundreds of published sources, including the OECD Income Distribution Database, the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean generated by CEDLAS and the World Bank, Eurostat, the World Bank’s PovcalNet, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, national statistical offices around the world, and academic studies while minimizing reliance on problematic assumptions by using as much information as possible from proximate years within the same country. The data collected and harmonized by the Luxembourg Income Study is employed as the standard. The SWIID currently incorporates comparable Gini indices of disposable and market income inequality for 196 countries for as many years as possible from 1960 to the present; it also includes information on absolute and relative redistribution."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-02-28"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income inequality"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Solt, Frederick. 2019. \"Measuring Income Inequality Across Countries and Over Time: The Standardized World Income Inequality Database\""}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Solt, Frederick"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-03-04"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Standardized World Income Inequality Database, version 8.0, February 2019.","label":"swiid8_0.zip","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"s80","version":1,"datasetVersionId":150820,"dataFile":{"id":3376371,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"swiid8_0.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":22344539,"description":"Standardized World Income Inequality Database, version 8.0, February 2019.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:169494faad5-96775e8a485b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e527635d1d1795ba2112d8da29ac0716","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e527635d1d1795ba2112d8da29ac0716"}}},{"description":"BibTeX citation for the SWIID's article of record and current database version.","label":"SWIIDv8_0.bib","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":150820,"dataFile":{"id":3376370,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"SWIIDv8_0.bib","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":586,"description":"BibTeX citation for the SWIID's article of record and current database version.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16949511435-a992a26601a0","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"cb42181dd6566931eb225e663eb6c8bd","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"cb42181dd6566931eb225e663eb6c8bd"}}}]}}}
