Liberal peace theory contends that both economic dependence and democratic political systems reduce conflict propensities. Extant empirical analyses of the monadic liberal peace, however, are under-specified. First, the concept of economic dependence not only includes trade, but also foreign investment. Second, existing models do not control for the influence of economic development. Previous research on the monadic liberal peace has also failed to distinguish between the initiation of conflict and participation in conflict. We find evidence for a liberal peace: trade dependence, foreign investment, and democracy reduce a state's propensity to initiate militarized disputes."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-09-27"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Souva Prins.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68411,"dataFile":{"id":1544612,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Souva Prins.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":164239,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:54148","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e1a8fb666585154530a1f89a295a4e13","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e1a8fb666585154530a1f89a295a4e13"}}}]}}}
