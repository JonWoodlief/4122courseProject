Those surveyed were asked to give their   approval rating of George Bush with respect to his handling of the   presidency, foreign policy, the situation in Iraq, and the economy.   Questions were posed regarding Ross Perot, respondents' vote   intentions for the 1992 presidential election, their opinions of the   1992 presidential candidates and their running mates, and the   likelihood of their voting in the 1992 presidential election.   Respondents were queried regarding the United States Congress, taxes,   government spending, the national economy, the federal budget\ndeficit, the environment, family values, and the Hurricane Andrew   disaster. Items relating to Bush and Bill Clinton focused on their   ability to deal with problems and with an international crisis in   particular, their ideas to end the recession, and their areas of   concentration in the campaign. Questions concerning Clinton dealt   with his draft status, his performance as governor of Arkansas, and   his vice-presidential running mate Al Gore. Additional questions   focused on the Iran-Contra situation, the state of the future   generation, stimulating the economy versus protecting the   environment, and the rationale of lawyers in encouraging lawsuits.   Background information on respondents includes sex, age, race,   marital status, education, financial situation, religious preference,   political orientation, party preference, voter registration status,  and vote choices in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
