The study was accomplished in two phases viz. field survey and laboratory analysis with lactoscan and adulteration test. The survey findings revealed that most of the farmers (95%) knew the basic importance and the procedures to be adopted for quality milk production however they were lacking putting them into practice. Majority of farms (78.75%) used maize and bran as principal ingredients of concentrate. Most of the farms (81.25%) supplied green throughout the year and there 90% farms maintained their animals under stall feeding. Less than fifty percent farmers (43.75%) practiced hand washing with soap before milking and rest (56.25%) washed their hands by common water only. Majority of farmers (83.75%) practiced udder washing by water only. Laboratory analyses were carried out by taking 128 raw milk samples fortnightly from different MCCs in order to analyse fat, SNF, protein, electrical conductivity, sp. gravity and water. Sixty four samples from Bijayanagar, Gadhi, Saranpur, Chowki, Haraiya, Narayanchowk, Shantichowk and Bangai were considered for the study of adulteration by substances like sugar, salt, starch, neutralizer, urea etc. The data indicated that 1.56 and 3.12; 3.12 and 3.12; 3.12 and 3.12; 1.56 and 1.56; 1.56 and 3.12 percent for salt and sugar respectively for the MCC Bijayanagar, Gadhi, Saranpur, Chowki and Bangai. However, the values of 4.68% for sugar and 1.56% of the samples were adulterated by salt respectively for Haraiya and Narayanchowk. None of the samples were adulterated with any substances in Shantichowk. As a whole, none of the MCC showed any other adulterants.\r\nThe highest and the lowest values for fat, SNF, protein, conductivity, specific gravity and water content location wise were Chowki and Bijayanagar; Saranpur and Haraiya; Bijayanagar and chowki and Bijayanagar and Saranpur respectively. Rest of the location indicated the values within these. Similarly, period wise, highest and lowest values for fat, SNF, protein, conductivity and water content were 3rd and 7th; 7th and 4th; 7th and 4th; 7th and 1st; 7th and 4th; 4th and 3rd fortnight respectively. The result obtained from the study on the quality of raw milk from different places of western Chitwan indicated that the current situation need improvement from adulteration point of view as most of the samples were adulterated from salt and sugar. However, none of the samples were found to be adulterated by starch, neutralizer and urea."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-11"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"United States"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"4"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1/2016"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"dissertation"}]}},"files":[{"description":"January-April 2016 Issue (Vol 4, No 1/2016)","label":"Quality of Raw Milk Supplied to Organized Milk Collection Centers of Western Chitwan.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88794,"dataFile":{"id":2917438,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6OULGY/EGCTJU","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6OULGY/EGCTJU","filename":"Quality of Raw Milk Supplied to Organized Milk Collection Centers of Western Chitwan.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":912568,"description":"January-April 2016 Issue (Vol 4, No 1/2016)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:158547859b8-89dbec08cb42","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2b23189dfc9cf82a221be91c25c4477e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2b23189dfc9cf82a221be91c25c4477e"}}}]}}}
