Those polled were registered Democrats residing in Washington, DC.  Respondents were asked about their likelihood of voting in the  Democratic primary election for mayor, for whom they planned to vote,  whether they knew if Mayor Anthony Williams' or Willie Wilson's name  would be printed on the ballot, and whether they approved of the way  that Williams was handling his job as mayor. Respondents were also  asked to give their impressions of former Mayor Marion Barry,  Williams, and Wilson, and to comment on whether the fact that Anthony  Williams' name would not be printed on the Democratic primary ballot  would make them more or less likely to vote for him, whether Williams'  petition problems were a reason they might decide to vote for another  candidate, whether they agreed with the statement that Mayor Williams  was not doing enough to help lower-income city residents, whether they  voted in the last Democratic mayoral primary in 1998, for whom they  voted in the 1998 primary, and whether they knew the name of the  school, church, or other place where people on their block voted in an  election.
