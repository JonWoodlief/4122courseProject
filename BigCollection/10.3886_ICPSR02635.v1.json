Respondents were  asked to assess Clinton's honesty and trustworthiness, his moral and  ethical standards, his leadership ability, and his ability to maintain  a strong economy. Those queried were asked whether they trusted  Clinton to handle the nation's business, whether they based their  impressions of Clinton on his personal or professional performance,  and whether one could consider him an effective political leader, yet  a poor moral leader. Respondents were also asked whether they believed  that Clinton had obstructed justice in attempting to hide his  relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, whether  the scandal had damaged his ability to serve effectively as president,  and whether Clinton should resign or Congress should remove him from  office. Those queried were asked to compare Clinton's honesty and  moral and ethical standards to those of former presidents.
