Together, the two surveys are referred to as the New Beneficiary Data   System (NBDS). The NBDS contains information on the changing   circumstances of aged and disabled Title II beneficiaries. This wave   includes information from administrative records as well as data from   followup interviews with survivors from the original survey. The NBS   was conducted in late 1982 with a sample representing nearly 2 million   persons who had begun receiving Social Security benefits during a   12-month period in 1980-1981. Personal interviews were completed with   three types of beneficiaries: 9,103 retired workers, 5,172 disabled   workers, and 2,417 wife or widow beneficiaries. In addition, interviews   were obtained from 1,444 aged persons who were entitled to Medicare   benefits but were not receiving Social Security payments because of   high earnings. The NBS interviews covered a wide range of topics,   including demographic characteristics of the respondent, spouse, and   any other persons in the household, as well as marital and childbearing   history, employment history, current income and assets, and health.   Selected data were also gathered from spouses and added from   administrative records. The NBF followup interviews were conducted   throughout 1991 with surviving original sample persons from the NBS and   surviving spouses of NBS decedents. The NBF updated information on   economic circumstances obtained in the NBS, and added or expanded   sections dealing with health, family contacts, and post-retirement   employment. The interviews also probed major changes in living   circumstances that might cause changes in economic status (for example,   death of a spouse, episodes of hospitalization, and changes of   residence). In addition, disabled workers were asked about their   efforts to return to work, experiences with rehabilitation services,   and knowledge of Social Security work incentive provisions. Since the   1982 survey, selected information on the NBS respondents has been   compiled periodically from Social Security, Supplemental Security   Income (SSI), and Medicare records. These administrative data, which   can be linked to the survey data, make it possible to analyze changes   in NBS respondents' covered earnings, cash benefits, participation in  the SSI program, and health expenses."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"living conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marital status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicare"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"older adults"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reproductive history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.D.
