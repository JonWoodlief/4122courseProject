Six Cities Trusteeship Project was designed to chart and understand the changes in the scope, scale, diversity, growth, and role of nonprofit trusteeship in the United States from 1931 to 1991.

Each research team was responsible for identifying the 15 organizations in their city that fit the criteria of largest 501(c)(3): secular hospital, Protestant hospital, Catholic hospital, Jewish hospital, art museum, symphony orchestra, United Way, institution of higher education, Junior League, community foundation, YMCA, YWCA, secular family services, Catholic family services, and Jewish family services. The process resulted in a board-level data set of about ninety organizations that would be directly comparable across cities; researchers then collected demographic information on the trustees of each organization during the years 1931, 1961, and 1991.

The project coordinator provided research teams in each city with codesheets indicating the information to be collected. Memoranda were sent to researchers with instructions as questions arose or coding procedures changed. The research teams collected biographical information on trustees through print sources, Nexis searches, and interviews. They completed the codesheets as thoroughly as possible given the information available. There is extensive missing data in this study due to factors such as a lack of adequate records from 1931 and uncooperative organizations.
