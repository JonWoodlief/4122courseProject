Respondents' attitudes toward labor and residential mobility included what was most important for their quality of life, the main reasons they had for moving, what improved and what got worse after the last time they moved to another region or European Union country, whether they intended to move to another member state in the near future, their reasons for changing their place of residence, and the most important difficulties they would have to face. Respondents were also asked for their current job and previous job, their title, the reason for changing jobs, as well as their satisfaction with their current job and professional life. Respondents were asked additional questions about whether they took any training courses to improve their professional skills in the last 12 months, and the main reason why they did or did not. The second topic covered was risk issues regarding food. Respondents were asked questions such as: (1) what came to mind when thinking about possible problems or risks associated with food, (2) when going shopping for food, what were the most important factors that influenced their choices, (3) compared to ten years ago, had food safety improved, (4) if a serious food risk were found in fish or chicken, who would they trust the most to inform them about the risk, and (5) whether they had heard any European Union regulations about food safety, consumers' rights, or quality standards for hospitals. The third topic was about smoking habits and passive smoking. Respondents answered questions such as: (1) if they smoked every day, how many cigarettes a day they smoked, (2) if they were in favor of smoking bans in the public space, (3) how often they were bothered by exposure to tobacco smoke in daily life, and (4) why this exposure to tobacco bothered them. Another topic covered was AIDS prevention. Respondents' opinions were sought regarding how AIDS can be caught, whether the measures currently being undertaken in their country (such as an information campaign on the types of behavior that expose people to infection by the AIDS virus, and research funding to find an AIDS vaccine) were very effective and useful. The final topic, medical errors, asked how often respondents\nread or heard about medical errors in their country, how important a problem they thought medical errors were in their country, whether they or a family member suffered a serious medical error, and how likely it was that a hospital patient could avoid a serious medical error. Background information includes respondent's age, gender, nationality, origin of birth (personal and parental), marital status, left-to-right political self-placement, occupation, age when they stopped full-time education, household composition,region of residence, and use of a fixed or a mobile telephone."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AIDS"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AIDS prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"eating habits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"infectious diseases"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical malpractice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"regulation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk factors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"smoking"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tobacco use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
