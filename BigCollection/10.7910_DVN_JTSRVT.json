In 1.3G, H800 is the chief source of a large error field generated by its own SCF. To study the effectiveness of the field-shaking technique, we use two NI REBCO double-pancakes, one from 2 coils (HCoil2 and HCoil3) of the 3 H800 coils, and place them in the bore of a 5-T/300-mm room-temperature bore external magnet. The external magnet is used not only to induce SCF in the double-pancakes but also elimi-nate it by the field-shaking. For each run, we induce SCF in the double-pancake at an axial location where the external radial field Br > 0, then for the field-shaking, move to another location where the external axial field Bz >> BR. To examine if other SCF eliminating techniques, e.g., the current-sweep-reversal (CSR) method, is applicable to H800 even when L500 and H800 are series-connected, we perform similar sequences of test for other combinations of the double-pancake axial locations. In this paper, we report 77-K experimental results, develop an analy-sis that satisfactorily explains the results, and apply the analy-sis to design a field-shaking system for 1.3G at full operation."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1.3-GHz NMR magnet"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cryogenics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hts magnet"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"superconducting magnet"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"superconducting tape"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/17ja/17ja054/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-17-54</a><br /><br />This work was supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"17ja054_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149261,"dataFile":{"id":3337582,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"17ja054_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":414474,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1681a5b8cde-2ec3de0d83c6","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b20ca80684683b142e7ee70e941e8a0f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b20ca80684683b142e7ee70e941e8a0f"}}}]}}}
