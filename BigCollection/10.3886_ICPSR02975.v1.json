The phase of treatment at the Jackson Cooper Street facility lasted six  months, and was followed by a 12-month aftercare component. The main  theory of change behind the program was that education about drugs and  their physical, familial, and social effects, coupled with opportunities  to learn about recovery and identify triggers for substance use, would  help substance-abusing offenders to avoid both substance abuse and  criminal behaviors once released into the community. This study used  multiple data sources. Part 1, Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC)  Data, was acquired from the MDOC's Correctional Management Information  System, which included demographic, criminal history, programming, and  institutional misconduct information for a snapshot of the entire inmate  population.

The phase of treatment at the Jackson Cooper Street facility lasted six  months, and was followed by a 12-month aftercare component. The  in-custody phase of treatment was guided by a standardized,  cognitively-based curriculum created by Ken Wanberg and Harvey Milkman,  \"Strategies for Self Improvement and Change.\" The main theory of change  behind the program was that education about drugs, and their physical,  familial, and social effects, coupled with opportunities to learn about  recovery and identify triggers for substance use, would help  substance-abusing offenders to avoid both substance abuse and criminal  behaviors once released into the community. The overall goal\ns of this  research were to (1) conduct a process evaluation that examined the  integrity of program implementation, and (2) make specific  recommendations with regard to program structure and eligibility  criteria that could better prepare the program for an impact evaluation.  The major areas of focus included: (1) program context, including  program design, agencies contributing to its development, costs, and  operating assumptions regarding criminal behavior and the treatment of  addiction, (2) program goals, including compatibility, clarity, and  measurability of goals, operating assumptions and selection of  participants, and the level of buy-in from key stakeholders, (3)  selection criteria, including stated criteria and their operation,  profile of applicants versus the larger pool of eligible inmates, rates  of program completion, and frequency and reasons for dropouts and  terminations, (4) program intervention, including comparison between  program's design and its form once it became operational, type,  intensity, and duration of services and the degree to which treatment  standards have been realized, and (5) interagency linkages, including  level of cooperation and coordination among agencies actively involved  in program delivery and the relationship between the program and the Michigan Parole Board."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study used multiple data sources.
