Much of the interest has focused on the increased  incidence of compulsive or pathological gambling in those areas that  offer legalized gambling, and increased social ills, such as  crime. Concern about the spread of legalized gambling has provided  renewed interest in and funding f\nor research on the extent, nature,  and consequences of pathological gambling. However, most of what is  known about pathological gambling is derived from studies of treatment  populations or the general public. With few exceptions, research has  not examined the disorder in populations where it is arguably more  prevalent and severe, namely in the criminal populations. In fact,  very little research has been conducted to determine the prevalence  and consequences of pathological gambling in jail or arrestee  populations. This study sought to examine the extent, nature, and  consequences of pathological gambling disorders in arrestee  populations. Five research questions were addressed: (1) What is the  prevalence of pathological gambling in arrestee populations? (2) What  is the profile of the pathological gambler arrested for felony and  misdemeanor offenses?

At the time of this study's release,  the ADAM program was operational in approximately 35 cities  nationwide, providing national and local profiles of drug use within  arrestee populations and the monitoring of drug use patterns. An  extension and refinement of the previous Drug Use Forecasting (DUF)  program (see DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES,  1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]), the ADAM program (see ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE  MONITORING (ADAM) PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 1999 [ICPSR 2994],  2000 [ICPSR 3270], and 2001 [ICPSR 3688]) is the United States  government's primary source of information on drug use among  arrestees, and is one of the primary research tools on drug use,  crime, and other social indicators. Quarterly interviews with  arrestees selected using probability-based (for males) and convenience  sampling (for females) were conducted in jails and detention  facilities at each ADAM site. Urine samples were also collected and  tested for a core panel of drugs that included cocaine,  methamphetamine, marijuana, and opiates. Because the drug screen  could not detect drugs beyond 72 hours after use, only arrestees who  had been incarcerated 48 hours or less were eligible for  participation. The ADAM interview provided demographic and descriptive  data including race, age, marital status, source of income, screens  for substance abuse and dependency, treatment history, arrest and  incarceration experiences, and participation in local drug markets. At  the conclusion of the interview, respondents were asked to provide a  urine specimen. For this study, arrestees in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Des  Moines, Iowa, who had completed the ADAM interview and provided a  urine specimen were asked if they would be willing to answer an  additional set of questions concerning their gambling behavior. The  gambling addendum was administered as part of the ADAM data collection  in Las Vegas and Des Moines for six consecutive quarters beginning in  the fourth quarter of 1999. In the first quarter of 2000, the ADAM  program adopted a new instrument with major revisions, additions, and  deletions of items. The revised ADAM instrument retained specific  demographic and offense- related items, allowing limited use of the  interviews completed prior to its implementation. While data were  collected on the gambling behaviors of male and female arrestees since  the fourth quarter of 1999, only those who were interviewed using the  revised instrument, whi\nch starting being administered in the first  quarter 2000, are represented in this data collection, which is  comprised of responses from approximately 1,900 arrestees. At the  core of the 144-item gambling addendum was a modified version of the  National Opinion Research Center (NORC), Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual (DSM) Screen for Gambling Problems, commonly referred to as  NODS. This gambling screen was composed of 17 items that assessed  lifetime problem gambling and a corresponding set of 17 items  assessing past-year gambling problems. The gambling addendum, however,  included only past-year NODS items. The decision to exclude lifetime  items was based on time and budgetary concerns. Data from the ADAM  interviews and drug screening were merged with data collected using the gambling addendum, producing the dataset for this study."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Demographic variables taken from the ADAM data  collection include respondent's age, gender, race, ethnicity,  residency, education, employment, health insurance coverage, marital  status, and telephone access.
