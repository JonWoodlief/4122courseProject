It is intended for longitudinal  analyses of effects of welfare reform on individuals, families, and  households. The file can be linked to the Survey of Program Dynamics  (SPD) First Longitudinal File (ICPSR 3315), SPD Second Longitudinal  File (ICPSR 3594), SPD 1997 Bridge (ICPSR 2797), SPD 1998 (ICPSR  2917), and the SIPP panel files for 1992 (ICPSR 6429) and 1993 (ICPSR  6886). The subject matter is described as follows: demographic data  (age, sex, ethnic origin, marital status, household relationship,  education, and veteran status), economic data (work experience,  employment status, occupation, industry, weeks worked and hours per  week worked, total income, and income components for people 15 years  and older), income data (income from jobs, net income from business,  farm or rent, pensions, dividends, interest, and Social Security  payments), and data covering noncash income sources (food stamps,  school lunch program, employer-provided group health insurance plan,  employer-provided pension plans, Medicaid, Medicare, CHAMPUS or  military health care, and energy assistance). The file contains codes  for 41 individual states, plus the District of Columbia. The SPD  sample in the nine remaining states is identified in three groups for  confidentiality reasons: (1) Maine and Vermont, (2) Iowa, North  Dakota, and South Dakota, and (3) Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

The weights on this  file are longitudinal, therefore, they are only valid for estimates of  the characteristics of the cohorts of people who were represented by  the original sample persons from the SIPP 1992 and 1993 panels. An  original sample person is a sample person who was a self or proxy  respondent in Wave 1 of the SIPP 1992 or 1993 panel. Children born  since the beginning of the SIPP panel to original sample persons also  receive longitudinal weights. The original sample has undergone a  substantial amount of attrition from 1992 (or 1993) through 2002. As a  result, estimates from this file are not as representative of the  United States population as a cross-sectional survey would be.  Therefore, results should be viewed with caution. In addition, it  should be noted that this file is based on seven different survey  collection vehicles: the 1992/93 SIPP instruments that were used to  produce data for 1992, 1993, and 1994, a 1-7 modified March CPS  instrument that was used to collect data for calendar year 1996, the  1998 SPD instrument that was used to collect data for calendar year  1997, the 1999 SPD instrument that was used to collect data for  calendar year 1998, the 2000 SPD instrument that was used to collect  data for calendar year 1999, the 2001 SPD instrument that was used to  collect data for calendar year 2000 and the 2002 SPD instrument that  was used to collect data for calendar year 2001. Therefore, changes  that are noted over time could be the result of the different survey instruments used to produce the estimates.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006-08-03"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1992"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2001"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1992"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["personal interview"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["The universe consists of people who resided in the United  States, except people living in institutions, such as prisons and  nursing homes or entire military households, in March 1992 and/or  March 1993.
