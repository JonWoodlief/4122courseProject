As a result, shifts in the composition of the domestic coalition of support backing the leader provide a fundamental determinant of rivalry termination. While previous research (Bennett 1997) sought to explore the relationship between domestic political turnover and rivalry termination using regime transitions as a proxy for turnover of the stateâ€™s domestic ruling group, in practice this measure exhibits significant disconnect with the quantity of interest. Further, there are alternative pathways through which regime transitions may lead to rivalry termination. I test the relationship using new data from the CHISOLS project (Mattes, Leeds, and Matsumura 2016), finding that when rivals undergo a change in the source of support that maintains the leader in office, the probability of rivalry termination rises dramatically. I further find that regime transitions have an effect on the probability of rivalry termination that is independent of the effect of ruling coalition turnover. This study thus both asserts the relationship between domestic political turnover and rivalry termination and clarifies the mechanism by which the relationship operates."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Interactions, International"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-15"}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"44"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"5"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018"}}]}]}},"files":[{"label":"Archigos.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":141763,"dataFile":{"id":3224206,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/BYX6IL","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/BYX6IL","filename":"Archigos.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3445371,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165de73d5ce-146907b2dedd","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata-13","originalFormatLabel":"Stata 13 Binary","originalFileSize":5780006,"UNF":"UNF:6:aGaCS6mU5CpaRIyDTwgb+Q==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fce0d9026bf90ca3b88a3a6eee1c9759","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fce0d9026bf90ca3b88a3a6eee1c9759"}}},{"label":"Conflict Score.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":141763,"dataFile":{"id":3224208,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/Z77OAV","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/Z77OAV","filename":"Conflict Score.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":18045148,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165de73e663-8fbae45901fe","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata-13","originalFormatLabel":"Stata 13 Binary","originalFileSize":37467478,"UNF":"UNF:6:tua9p4FlDYbNuN/t+WclYA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0641c9dfccfa567f6c1da2b698a4f2cf","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0641c9dfccfa567f6c1da2b698a4f2cf"}}},{"label":"Rivalry Replication 1.25.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":141763,"dataFile":{"id":3224209,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/VWXQJV","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/VWXQJV","filename":"Rivalry Replication 1.25.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3361986,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165de73e9c8-41154aedf7f4","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata-13","originalFormatLabel":"Stata 13 Binary","originalFileSize":5600326,"UNF":"UNF:6:+/5kH6PvvNNz3QYN6iFolg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e8772b55e86109735074c8a2c3bc106e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e8772b55e86109735074c8a2c3bc106e"}}},{"label":"SOLS and Rivalry Termination.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":141763,"dataFile":{"id":3224207,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/HTVTRF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5WNUK2/HTVTRF","filename":"SOLS and Rivalry Termination.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":18881,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165de73eb08-9c0eabe1cc76","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"eaa50f91c838ad58a86331a9684776ee","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"eaa50f91c838ad58a86331a9684776ee"}}}]}}}
