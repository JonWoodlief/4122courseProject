Subprime lending has  introduced a substantial amount of risk-based pricing into the  mortgage market by creating a myriad of prices and product choices  largely determined by borrower credit history (mortgage and rental  payments, foreclosures and bankruptcies, and overall credit scores)  and down payment requirements. Although subprime lending still differs  from prime lending in many ways, much of the growth (at least in the  securitized portion of the market) has come in the least-risky (A-)  segment of the market. In addition, lenders have imposed prepayment  penalties to extend the duration of loans and required larger down payments to lower their credit risk exposure from high-risk loans."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"loans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mortgages"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
