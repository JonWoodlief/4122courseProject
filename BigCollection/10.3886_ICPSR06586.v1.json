The Institutional Population Component (IPC) is a   survey of nursing and personal care homes and facilities for the   mentally retarded and residents admitted to those facilities.   Information was collected on facilities and their residents at several   points during 1987. Use and expenditure estimates for institutionalized   persons can be combined with those from the Household Component for   composite estimates covering most of the civilian population.   Information on facilities and residents was collected from facility   administrators and caregivers, with additional information collected   from next-of-kin or other knowledgeable respondents. These data were   supplemented by Medicare claims information for covered sample persons.   Research File 36 provides information from the Medicare Automated Data   Retrieval System (MADRS) for a subset of persons from File 1 of   NATIONAL MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY, 1987: INSTITUTIONAL POPULATION   COMPONENT, FACILITY USE AND EXPENDITURE DATA FOR NURSING AND PERSONAL   CARE HOME RESIDENTS [PUBLIC USE TAPE 17] (ICPSR 6158) and a subset of   persons from File 1 of NATIONAL MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY, 1987:   INSTITUTIONAL POPULATION COMPONENT, FACILITY USE AND EXPENDITURE DATA   FOR RESIDENTS OF FACILITIES FOR PERSONS WITH MENTAL RETARDATION   [RESEARCH FILE 22R] (ICPSR 6467). Six data files are provided for   Research File 36R, all of which contain demographic data such as age\n,   sex, and race.
