Models for automatically and accurately scoring individual Tweets on the DIAMONDS dimensions of situations were developed. Stable daily and weekly fluctuations in the situations that people experience were identified. Predicted temporal trends were found, providing validation for this new method of situation assessment. On weekdays, Duty peaks in the midmorning and declines steadily thereafter while Sociality peeks in the evening. Negativity is highest during the workweek and lowest on the weekends. pOsitivity shows the opposite pattern. Additionally, gender and locational differences in the situations shared on Twitter are explored. Females share both more emotionally charged (pOsitive and Negative) situations, while no differences were found in the amount of Duty experienced by males and females. Differences in the situations shared from Rural and Urban areas were not found. Future applications of assessing situations using social media are discussed."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-05-28"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Situations, Social Media, LIWC, DIAMONDS, text-analysis; Personality"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The file tweets_8_14_to_8_28blinded.rds includes tweets streamed during the corresponding dates in August of 2014. \r\nSee read.txt file for descriptions of the remaining files which contain code needed to replicate analyses."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Serfass, David"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-05-28"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This file contains all code necessary to replicate results from the article Situations in 140 Characters: Assessing Real-World Situations on Twitter.
