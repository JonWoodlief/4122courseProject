Though certainly related, these data are at best a proxy for the actual commercial and productive activities of multinationals that most political scientists purport to be interested in. Simply put, this is a very indirect way of testing theories about the sociopolitical and economic factors that motivate MNCs’ choice of host countries. This article introduces a new firm-level data set designed to get around this problem by permitting more direct analysis of multinationals’ foreign operations. It then revisits the relationship between regime type and direct investment, finding evidence that MNCs are more likely to establish new subsidiaries in democracies than in nondemocracies. However, further analysis reveals that the strength of this relationship varies by context. Specifically, MNCs rely on regime type as an indicator of political risk when they lack an existing relationship with the host state. In addition, those operating in extractive industries are generally less responsive to political institutions than those operating in manufacturing or services. These results suggest that firm- and sector-specific factors deserve greater consideration than they have been given in the existing literature.\r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Interactions, International"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-03-10"}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"42:2"}}]}]}},"files":[{"label":"Bring Company Back In - Estimated Effects.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":134166,"dataFile":{"id":3132320,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5WUKVH/UOPUDC","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5WUKVH/UOPUDC","filename":"Bring Company Back In - Estimated Effects.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":4252,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1621117211a-5d8c2dfaca42","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata-13","originalFormatLabel":"Stata 13 Binary","originalFileSize":25899,"UNF":"UNF:6:qQbDIFceZ9xMAFtdId2kgA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2ef122feaea523202b172bfc200fb006","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2ef122feaea523202b172bfc200fb006"}}},{"label":"Bring Company Back In - Replication Code.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":134166,"dataFile":{"id":3132321,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5WUKVH/USIX4A","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5WUKVH/USIX4A","filename":"Bring Company Back In - Replication Code.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":21647,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1621117227d-2db221d84a97","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6108bb167ef3e022d50245435e15b767","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6108bb167ef3e022d50245435e15b767"}}}]}}}
