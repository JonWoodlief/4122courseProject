Work-related variables describe the place and conditions of   employment, including the degree of supervision, placement within the   workplace hierarchy, and the complexity of work with people, data, and   things. Respondents also were questioned regarding job satisfaction,   expecta\ntions for the future, job security, union membership and   activities, and preferred occupation. Additionally, respondents   provided self-evaluations of job and career performance, the importance   and prestige of their jobs, and a complete work history for all jobs   held for six months or more. Respondents who were parents at the time   of the interview were queried regarding parenting practices and   parental values, including methods of child discipline and   reinforcement employed, and the level of educational achievement and   future occupation preferred for their children. In addition,   respondents were asked to select the most and least desirable qualities   for their children from a prepared list of attributes. Respondents also   were questioned regarding social orientation and self-concept. To   measure social orientation, respondents were asked to state the extent   to which they agreed or disagreed with statements indicating   authoritarian or nonauthoritarian tendencies, different criteria of   morality and amorality, trustfulness and distrustfulness, and   statements indicating receptivity or resistance to change. Self-concept   was examined by questions concerning self-confidence and diffidence,   self-depreciation and self-endorsement, anxiety, fatalistic and   accountable attributions of responsibility, and the conformity or   independence of their ideas. Respondents also were asked to select the   values most and least desired for themselves. Background information   collected for respondents and their families includes household   composition, metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area of residence, marital   status and duration of marriage, education, ethnicity, religion,   country of birth and year of immigration, wife's age and employment   status, grandparents' occupations, and parents' country of birth,   occupation, education, and age when the respondent was born. Also   recorded were the number of brothers and sisters the respondent grew up   with, the occupation of each sibling, whether the respondent lived with   his parents and what his parents' occupations were when he was 16, the   age and education level of each child living in the respondent's  household, and the respondent's social class self-placement."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"men"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parenting skills"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personality"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self concept"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social values"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVI.A.
