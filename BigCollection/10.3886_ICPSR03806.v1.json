An original sample  person is a sample person who was a self or proxy respondent in Wave 1  of the SIPP 1992 or 1993 panel. A nonoriginal sample person is a  sample person who became part of the sample after the SIPP Wave 1 and  beyond (including the SPD samples). The SIPP 1992 and 1993 Panel  samples, from which the SPD sample originated, were designed to  produce only national estimates of the characteristics of interest to  the user. Although this 2001 cross-sectional file includes state  identifiers and is weighted to current state (as well as national)  control\ns, deriving sub-national estimates from this 9-year-old sample  that has experienced severe attrition (household and person  nonresponse) and other sample loss (through death,  institutionalization, etc.) as well as sample cuts dictated by  budgetary constraints, results in inadequate representativeness and  poor coverage in some of the smaller geographic areas. Even for the  national estimates, inadequate representativeness and poor coverage  occur in children of all races as well as Black adults aged 20 to  39. In addition to noninterview adjustment, Bureau of the Census  attempted to further correct for these deficiencies by bringing back  noninterviews from the 1997 Bridge sample and from a subset of the  SIPP 1992/1993 Panels. These sample cases are included in this  cross-sectional file, and will be included in the third (and final) longitudinal file, as well."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD), 2001  Cross-Sectional File  ","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41830,"dataFile":{"id":2662686,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD), 2001  Cross-Sectional File  ","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
