The current study links longitudinal crime data to a series of other databases. The purpose of the study was to examine the possible correlates of variability in crime trends over time. The focus was on how crime distributes across very small units of geography. Specifically, this study investigated the geographic distribution of crime and the specific correlates of crime at the micro level of geography. The study reported on a large empirical study that investigated the \"criminology of place.\" The study linked 16 years of official crime data on street segments (a street block between two intersections) in Seattle, Washington, to a series of datasets examining social and physical characteristics of micro places over time, and examined not only the geography of developmental patterns of crime at place but also the specific factors that are related to different trajectories of crime. The study used two key criminological perspectives, social disorganization theories and opportunity theories, to inform their identification of risk factors in the study and then contrast the impacts of these perspectives in the context of multivariate statistical models."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this study was to examine the possible correlates of variability in crime trends over time."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>In this logitudinal study a total of 24,023 street segments in Seattle were analyzed.

The UofA_lines file contains the vector representation of the street segments in Seattle, Washington, as defined by the study. Only residential and arterial streets were included in the study. Limited access highways were excluded because of their lack of interactive human activity. This left 24,023 units of analysis (i.e., street segments) in Seattle. For this study, the unit of analysis is defined as a street segment (i.e., as both sides of the street between two intersections). The original street centerline file obtained from the Seattle GIS department was edited to make sure each street met the study definition. Each street has a Street_id which is a unique identifier. The UofA_points file contains the m\nid-points of all the street segments. This shape file also contains a Street_id field which is a unique identifier.
