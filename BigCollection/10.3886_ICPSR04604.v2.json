Middletown III  included the Family Roles Survey (1977), the High School Survey (1977,  1989), the Community Survey (1978), the Government Services Survey  (1978), the Kinship Survey (1978), the Neighborhood Survey (1978), the  Religion Survey (1978), the Women's Occupational Survey (1978), and  the Recreation Survey (1982). Middletown IV was a 1999 replication of  two of the most important surveys that had been conducted in 1924 and  1977: the Community Survey and the High School Survey. The High School  Survey (1977, 1989, and 1999) queried respondents about the number of  years they attended Muncie schools, membership in extra-curricular  activities, sex education, curriculum, grades and schoolwork, books  and magazines read that were not assigned, and future plans post-high  school. Respondents were also asked about close friendships, work  outside of school, activities on Sunday, and their opinions about  their relationship with their parents, and several statements about  personal, political, and social issues. For the Community Survey  (1978, 1999), respondents were asked about their residence and living  in Muncie, as well as job history, reasons to work, and the advantages  g\nained from working. The survey also asked questions of respondents  about spouse employment and vacation, household roles, activities, and  expenses, as well as close friendships, important qualities in boys  and girls, educational plans for their children, and opinions on  special topics. For the Family Roles Survey (1978), respondents were  asked to express their opinion in regard to raising a family in  Muncie, spouse role performance and expectations, marital  satisfaction, and close friendships. The Government Services Survey  (1978) asked respondents about their participation in the 1976  presidential, 1974 Indiana congressional, and 1975 Muncie city  elections, service in the armed forces, and housing. In addition, the  survey asked respondents for their opinion in regard to unemployed  citizens, welfare, the Muncie community, and government programs, as  well as their awareness or use of certain programs. The Kinship Survey  (1978) asked respondents to identify where and how long they lived at  a location in relationship to Muncie. In addition, respondents were  asked for demographic information about their spouse, mother and  father (their own and their spouse's), siblings, cousins, and  children, their relationship and interactions with them, including  their participation in different types of activities together, giving  or receiving of goods or services, and frequency of communication. The  Neighborhood Survey (1978), queried respondents about their residence  in a Muncie neighborhood and their intent to remain at or move from  this location. Opinions were sought about the neighborhood and  particular facilities visited, attended, or used most often.  Respondents were also asked to identify whether relatives or friends  lived in Muncie, the location of their residence, as well as their  spouses' work location. Respondents scored their interactions with  their closest relative, and identified relationships with friends and  work associates. In the Religion Survey (1978), respondents provided  information about their participation in political elections, what  activities they enjoy, as well as their opinion in regard to quality  of life, marital satisfaction, racial inequality, women's liberation,  and their response when encountering a problem. In addition,  respondents were asked about their religious behavior and  philosophies, including practices such as prayer, fasting, and the  teaching and study of different religions. For the Women's  Occupational Survey (1978), respondents were queried about their views  in regard to quality of life and marriage including number of times  and age married, the status of the marriage, number of children born  in each marriage, marital satisfaction, relationship with spouse,  causes of disagreement with spouse, and household roles. Pertaining to  occupation, respondents answered questions about job training and  requirements, job satisfaction, and job discrimination. They also  provided their opinions about how work had affected their  relationships with their children and spouse. For the Recreation  Survey (1982), respondents were queried about attending professional  events, participating in sports and household activities, visiting  particular recreational locations, owning recreational, electronic, or  entertainment equipment, and playing a musical instrument. In  addition, the survey posed questions about membership in a group or  organization, vacations, religious behaviors, and books or magazines  read. Respondents also provided their opinion about gender attributes  pertaining to societal roles. Major demographic themes that may appear  in one or more of the surveys include age, gender, race, birthplace,  occupation and employment, income, social class, education, marital  status, religious preference, number of friends or relatives in the  city, number and ages of children or siblings, and household  composition, as well as the topic of organizational memberships,  po\nlitical affiliation, time spent per day watching movies or  television, and number of newspaper or magazine subscriptions. For the  Community Survey (1978, 1999), Kinship Survey (1978), Neighborhood  Survey (1978), and Women's Occupational Survey (1978), in addition to  occupation, the data may also include Duncan Socioeconomic Index (SEI), Siegel Prestige, or industry classification codes."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career
