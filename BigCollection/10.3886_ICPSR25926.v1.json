An experimental group was drawn from the First and Second Precincts, where the program was adopted, and a control group was drawn from the Third and Fourth Precincts. Control cases received the conventional police response. The experimental cases received intervention from both the Richmond Police and the Second Responders.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers followed a number of additional procedures to select eligible cases for the treatment and control groups. They paid a daily visit to the Youth and Family Crime Unit of the Richmond Police Department in order to copy the PD 109, or family violence report, forms that were submitted each day during the sampling period. They subsequently entered information from the forms into a database that ultimately provided the pool for a sample. Cases in the treatment districts that met criteria for inclusion but for which the researchers did not receive a second responder report were checked to determine if they had in fact been served by the social workers. Cases that did not receive the service in the treatment precincts were consequently excluded from both the treatment and control groups.</p>\n\n<p>Domestic violence literature and experimental studies, such as the Spouse Assault Replication Program (SARP), provided a basis\nfor the development of interview instruments, which underwent review by qualified experts and a pretest before actual use. Field interviewers received training in contact protocols, reviewed the interview instruments, and engaged in role-playing before meeting the study's participants.</p>\n\n<p>The evaluation of the Second Responder Program was based on two waves of interviews with victims of domestic violence.

Respondents were asked to assess their attitudes toward the police and toward the second responder.

Respondents were asked about protective orders, custody of children, and the criminal outcome of the incident and their experiences with the court system.  There were also questions related to the respondent's experience with family violence workers, and their experiences with friends and family since the incident. Several questions explored the incidence, prevalence, and types of violence that occurred in the respondent's life, including history of domestic violence, the initial crisis that brought them into the study, and about incidents that occurred in the subsequent six months. The experience of four main types of victimization were also documented: (1) the number of times the respondent's partner had harmed them, (2) the number of times the respondent's partner had threatened to harm them, (3) the number of times the respondent's partner had threatened to kill them, and (4) the number of times the respondent's partner had damaged property in their home.
