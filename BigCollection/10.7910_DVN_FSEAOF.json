One hundred dyads received standard of care (SoC), and 88 dyads were offered the intervention CCP. Patient-caregiver dyads were evaluated on patient complications and healthcare utilization; Caregiver Activation Measure; and health-promoting behaviors and medication adherence. Assessments were completed at baseline, discharge, and 30 days post-discharge.
