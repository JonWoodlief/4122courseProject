The OAMA Client Questionnaire variables include demographics, cognitive and mental capacities, financial exploitation measures, psychological abuse measures, and variables indicating the relationship of the elderly client to their primary trusted family member or friend.  In addition to 12 variables on age, race, gender, personal finances, and the pre-questionnaire cognitive capacity of the client, the OAMA Client Questionnaire consisted of two primary measurement tools for financial exploitation and psychological abuse. First, the Older Adult Psychological Abuse Measure (OAPAM) contained 37 variables for measurements on suspected physical, psychological and medical abuse of the elderly client by their primary trusted family member or caretaker within the past year. The variables in OAPAM measured various forms of psychological abuse of the elderly, such as isolation, disrespect, exploiting vulnerability, shame, threats and intimidation, and risk factors related to the client's trusted friends or family. Second, the Older Adult Financial Exploitation Measure (OAFEM) contained 83 variables for measurements of various forms of suspected financial exploitation of the elderly client by their primary trusted family member or caretaker.  The variables in OAFEM measured items including theft, scams, coercion, signs of abuse or financial entitlement by trusted friends or family members, and money management difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>The OAMA Staff Questionnaire variables include investigator position, agency code, investigator years of experience, investigator gender and race, and variables indicating the relationship of their client to the primary trusted caretaker, as well as their client's pre-questionnaire cognitive and psychological capacity.
