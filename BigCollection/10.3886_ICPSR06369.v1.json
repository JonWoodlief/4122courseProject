The study dealt with three samples. Two of the samples included victims and  witnesses currently involved in the criminal justice  system in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (\"in-system\" samples).  The third sample included was of victims originally located by the National  Crime  Survey conducted in Milwaukee in early 1974, who were reinterviewed on behalf  of this project by the United States Bureau of the Census (\"community\"  sample). Members of the \"in-system\" samples were contacted as their cases  were considered at one of four  stages in the criminal justice process: (1) the screening conference in the  district attorney's office, (2) the preliminary hearing, (3) the misdemeanor  trial, or (4) the felony trial. Both the in-system and community respondents  were asked about their attitudes toward security and safety, criminals, and  restitution, what problems crime victims may have as a result of experiencing  the crime and going to court, and their satisfaction with the handling of  their case by the police, the district attorney, and the judge. Incident  data cover the respondent's relationship to the offender, injuries  sustained, type of crime and what happened, reason for calling/not  calling police, and losses resulting from the crime. Follow-up data supply  information on resulting emotional problems and other problems resulting  from the crime, how people close to the respondent were affected, financial,  interpersonal, and physical-emotional crime-related problems, and court  system-related problems. Additional questions were asked about the types  of services provided by social agencies to the crime victims and witnesses,  the respondent's opinion of the behavior of the police, and, for victims,  perceptions of the importance of providing help for crime victims.  Demographic variables include age, education, race, sex, income, occupational prestige status, and employment history of respondents."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"case processing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trial procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victim compensation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victim services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victims"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
