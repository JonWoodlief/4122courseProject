From July 1, 1990, to June 30, 1991, the project staff obtained daily reports from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Admissions Office regarding new admissions to specified units. If patients granted permission, the staff member administered a Criminal Victimization Screening Schedule (CVSS) and asked permission to review the relevant portion of their medical charts. Patients were also asked if they would be willing to participate in interviews about their victimization. If so, they were given the Criminal Victimization Interview (CVI), a structured interview schedule developed for this study that included items on demographics, victim and assault characteristics, knowledge of victims' rights, and a post-traumatic stress disorder checklist. This information is contained in Part 1, Interview Data File. At the conclusion of the personal interviews, patients were referred to the Model Hospital Victim Assistance Program (MHVAP), which was developed for this project and which provided information, advocacy, crisis counseling, and post-discharge referral services to hospitalized crime victims and their families. The Follow-Up Criminal Victimization Interview (FUCVI) was administered to 30 crime victims who had participated in the study and who were successfully located 3 months after discharge from the hospital.

For each new admission, charge nurses in each of the  cooperating units were contacted by a staff member and asked if the  current medical condition of the newly-admitted patient permitted a  brief interview. For each patient whose condition permitted an  interview, a staff member asked the patient if he or she would be  willing to answer a few short questions about the events that produced  the injuries. If a patient granted permission, the staff member  administered the Criminal Victimization Screening Schedule (CVSS) and  asked permission to review the relevant portion of the patient's  medical chart. Patients were also asked if they would be willing to  participate in interviews about their victimization. Ideally, the CVSS  was administered to patients described above after one to two days  following their admission. If they were not available after two days  following admission (e.g., patient was in a coma), they were  interviewed as soon as they were able to complete the procedure. For  patients who had no prospect of ever being able to complete the CVSS  or who died as a result of their injuries, an attempt was made to  contact a close family member. If possible, family members were  interviewed using a revised version of the CVSS. Patients who were  identified as crime victims and who agreed to participate were  administered the Criminal Victimization Interview (CVI) while  hospitalized. At the conclusion of the interview, the Model Hospital  Victim Assistance Program (MHVAP) developed for this project provided  victims with information, assisted with referral to the prosecutor's  office and/or police in their jurisdiction, provided a brief  psychological intervention when indicated, and assisted with  establishing future outpatient psychological follow-up. Other  remaining sessions consisted of working directly with the victim to  contact the appropriate criminal justice and victim service officials  in their home districts, assisting with appropriate outpatient  psychological follow-up for those individuals who would benefit from  such services, and instructing victims in the techniques of specific  crime-related psychological interventions. The Follow-Up Criminal  Victimization Interview (FUCVI) was administered to 30 crime victims  who had completed the CVI and who were successfully located three  months after discharge from the hospital. The crime victims who were  contacted for a follow-up interview also had to meet the following  criteria: the crime occurred in the state of South Carolina, the  victim was a resident of South Carolina at the time of the crime, and  the victim resided in South Carolina at the time that the CVI was  administered. Eligible victims were contacted for a telephone interview.
