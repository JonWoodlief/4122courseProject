Respondents' opinions were sought   on Reagan's performance as president, the granting of military aid to   the Nicaraguan contras, the planned public investigations of the Iran   arms affair by Congress, and the decision to grant Lieutenant Colonel   North and John Poindexter limited immunity, thus forcing them to talk   to the Congressional investigating committees. Respondents also were   asked to evaluate Reagan's role in the Iran arms affair and whether   they had seen the press conference. Additional questions for those   who had seen the press conference included whether Reagan had   sincerely tried to answer the questions put to him, if Reagan's   performance left the respondent feeling more or less confident about   his ability\nto lead the nation, and whether the Iran arms sales were   direct arms for hostages trades. Demographic characteristics of  respondents also are included."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
