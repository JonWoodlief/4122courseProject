In addition, the survey gauged  opinions on government and public affairs issues: whether the United  States ought to have much more military power than any other nation in  the world, whether women in the military should be allowed to  volunteer for combat assignments, whether women should be required to  register for the draft, and whether the United States should go to war  to protect its own economic interests or the rights of other countries.  Respondents were queried about current school enrollment status and  education level, highest grade completed, type of school and diploma,  and plans for college and financing a college education. Other  questions asked about current and past employment status, reasons for  working, satisfaction with current job, and the employment situation  in the respondent's community.
