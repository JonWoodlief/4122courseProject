To this end, the data  describe, over a 86-year period, the sources, processes, and outcomes  of all military-security crises involving states. Variables were  collected at both the micro/state actor level and the  macro/international system level. At the macro level, seven dimensions  of crisis were measured: crisis setting, crisis breakpoint-exitpoint,  crisis management technique, great power/superpower activity,  international organization involvement, crisis outcome, and crisis  severity. Additional macro-level variables indicate various aspects of  geography, polarity, system level, conflict type, power discrepancy,  and involvement by powers. At the state actor level, variables  measuring five dimensions of crisis were compiled: crisis trigger,  state actor behavior, great power/superpower activity, international  organization involvement, and crisis outcome. Additional micro-level  variables indicate the role of war in each crisis. Others measure  several kinds of state attributes: age, territory, regime  charact\neristics, state capability, state values, and social, economic, and political conditions."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"conflict"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crisis management"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international alliances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international conflict"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international organizations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"militarism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military intervention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"war"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"world problems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DATAPASS I.

These new crises are DRC-Rwanda (#444) and South  Ossetia/Abkhazia (#445). For international crises, the GLOBACTM and  GLOBEFAC variables now include an additional category for cases in  which the global organization authorized the use of military force by  members to enforce resolutions. This change also affects the actor  level variable GLOBACT. Two potential protracted conflicts are on the  watch list: DRC/Rwanda, and Georgia/Russia. We are currently  evaluating the crises involving these pairs of states, and a  definitive decision will be made by the next release. Two cases are in  an ongoing/interim category: Iran Nuclear (2002) and North Korea  Nuclear. These cases, each of which probably includes several crises,  are expected to be coded during the coming year. As was the case with  past releases of the ICB datasets, a number of minor coding changes have been made in earlier cases.;Version Date: 2006-05-15Version Text: 2006-05-15 Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Six new cases have been added for 2002  as well as the data producers's new coding changes.

The unit of observation for Part 1,  which contains the macro-level data, is the international crisis. The  unit of observation for Part 2, which contains the micro-level data,  is the crisis actors involved. In all, the data cover 445  international crises involving 979 state actors. Both parts include  non-numeric data.
