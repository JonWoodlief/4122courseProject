The study sought to  answer several questions: (1) What is the effect of legal supervision  on the criminal behavior of addicts? (2) Does legal supervision have  time-course effects? (3) What are the differential effects of varying  types of legal supervision (e.g., probation, parole, urinalysis,  higher or lower number of contacts per month)? Data were obtained by  conducting retrospective interviews with four separate groups of  subjects from four distinct research projects previously conducted in  Southern California (McGlothlin, Anglin, and Wilson, 1977, Anglin,  McGlothlin, and Speckart, 1981, Anglin, McGlothlin, Speckart, and Ryan,  1982, and McGlothlin and Anglin, 1981). The first group were male  patients in the California Civil Addict Program, admitted in  1962-1964, who were interviewed for this survey in 1974-1975. The  second group was a sample of addicts drawn from male first admissions  between the years 1971-1973 from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and  Orange County methadone maintenance programs. These respondents were  interviewed during the years 1978-1979, an average of 6.6 years after  admission. The third group consisted of male and female methadone  maintenance patients selected from rosters of clients active on June  30, 1976, at clinics in Bakersfield and Tulare, California. These  subjects were interviewed during 1978 and 1979, an average of 3.5  years after admission. The fourth group of subjects consisted of males  and females who were active on September 30, 1978, at San Diego,  Riverside, San Bernardino, and Orange County clinics and were  interviewed during the years 1980-1981, an average of six years after  their admission. Subjects included Anglo-American and Mexican-American  males and females. The samples were generally representative of  California methadone maintenance patients except for the second  sample, which had been selected to study the impact of civil  commitment parole status on the behavior of patients receiving  methadone and was not necessarily representative of the overall  population of admitted patients receiving methodone. Before the  interview, a schematic time line on each offender was prepared, which  included all known arrests and intervals of incarceration, legal  supervision, and methadone treatment, based on criminal justice system  and treatment program records. In discussion with the subject, the  interviewer established the date of the first narcotics use on the time  line, then proceeded chronologically through the time line, marking a  change in narcotics use from less-than-daily use to daily use (or vice  versa), or a change in the respondent's legal or treatment status, as  a time interval. The interviewer repeated this process for successive  intervals up through the date of the interview. Parts 1-8 consist of the  interview d\nata, with Forms 2 and 3 corresponding to the various  intervals. There can be multiple intervals for each individual.   Variables cover drug use, employment, criminal behavior, legal  status, conditions of parole or probation, and drug treatment  enrollment. Form 1 data contain background information on offenders,  such as family and substance abuse history, and Form 4 data include  other personal information as well as self-reported arrest and  treatment histories. Parts 9 and 10, Master Data, were created from  selected variables from the interview data. Parts 11 and 12,  Arrest Data, were collected from official criminal justice records and  describe each offender's arrests, such as month and year of arrest, charge,  disposition, and arrest category. The datasets are split between the Southern  California (Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange County, Bakersfield, Tulare, and Riverside) and San Diego clinic locations."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug dependence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug law offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug related crimes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"methadone maintenance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"supervised liberty"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"treatment programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
