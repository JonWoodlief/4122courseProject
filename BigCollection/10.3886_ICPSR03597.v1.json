The survey was sent to departments serving areas with  populations of 100,000 residents or greater, since research indicates  that departments of this size are more likely to have frequent  contacts with the news media. A list of departments that comprised the  sampling frame was obtained from the 1999 National Directory of Law  Enforcement Administrators, published by the National Public Safety  and Information Bureau. This directory contained over 37,000  department profiles covering 18 levels of jurisdiction (i.e.,  municipal, county, federal, corrections) and included such information  as municipality population, number of serving officers, and the name  of the acting department chief. The purpose of the survey was to  gather information regarding the strategies employed by various police  departments to promote and enhance their image through the media and  their perceived effectiveness, as reported by police officials. Survey  items identified the following factors: (1) the presence and nature of  a formal departmental media strategy, (2) the prevalence of full-time  police PIOs, (3) PIO background characteristics, including  educational/vocational training in media, journalism, or public  relations, (4) specific goals of police media relations offices and  PIOs, (5) the various methods by which these goals are achieved, and  (6) the perceived quality of police-media interaction, the police  image, and the public informatio\nn office both before and after the  adoption of the current media strategy. All surveys were addressed to  the highest-ranking official within the department, asking him/her to  respond to the survey personally or to have the survey completed by a  member of the department who could a accurately represent the views of  the top police official. Each respondent was asked to provide a  complete evaluation of department police-media relations and was  assured complete confidentiality of all information provided. A  pretest of the survey instrument that revealed questionnaire items  requiring minor revision was mailed to all municipal police  departments serving areas having populations between 90,000 and 99,999 residents. The final survey was mailed in the spring of 2000."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include the number of news organizations  and reporters (newspapers, TV, or radio) a department communicated  with during an average week, whether the department's staff ever  contacted reporters to issue a press release, schedule a news  conference, or provide assistance with crime coverage, whether the  department had a written media policy or media strategy, whether the  department's current media policy had been helpful in preparing the  department for communications with the media, controlling news leaks,  addressing allegations of misconduct, presenting a favorable public  image, or promoting department policing strategies, who within the  department had routine authorization to communicate with the media,  whether these individuals ever had any formal training in media  communication skills, whether the department provided training in  media communication for its staff and what the format (video  presentation, reading material, or guest lecturer) and content of the  training were, views on the importance of promoting crime prevention  education, building police/ community partnerships, building a  positive police image, and informing the public of police initiatives,  whether the department had a favorable or unfavorable working  relationship with the media, whether the department felt that the  media was biased against them, and complaints a department had  regarding media coverage of its department.
