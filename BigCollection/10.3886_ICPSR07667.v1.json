This file merges information from two  administrative sources: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the  Social Security Administration (SSA). The starting point of the merged  dataset was the IRS Tax Model File of Individual Income Tax Returns,  a public-use IRS file designed to sim\nulate the administrative and  revenue impact of tax law changes. It contains over 100,000 federal  income tax returns subsampled from the STATISTICS OF INCOME sample of  the following 1972 tax forms: (1) 1040, Individual Income Tax Return  (and its associated schedules), (2) 1040A, Individual Income Tax  Return, Short Form, (3) 4625, Computation of Minimum Tax, (4) Maximum  Tax on Earned Income, (5) Application for Automatic Extension of Time  to File United States Individual Income Tax Return, (6) 4874, Credit  for Wages Paid or Incurred in Work Incentive (WIN) Programs, and (7)  4875, Presidential Election Campaign Fund Statement. The nearly 170  items extracted from these tax forms include exemptions, earned and  unearned income, income loss, foreign tax credit, medical and dental  expenses over 3 percent of AGI, state and local income taxes, and  capital gains and losses. To this individual income tax data, the  Social Security Administration matched (using the unique  identifier of Social Security number) selected demographic information  (including such variables as the race, sex, and age of the primary  taxpayer) from the SSA's longitudinal summary earnings files for income year 1972.
