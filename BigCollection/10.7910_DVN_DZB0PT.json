Each record is uniquely associated with a particular census code. The records are sorted by the census code in ascending order. There is one record per industry, and hence 417 records.  Variables include: SIC code, census industry name, total output, intermediate output, consumption, investment, gross private fixed capital formation, net inventories, exports, government, federal government, federal government - defense, federal government - other, state and local government, state and local government - education, state and local government - health, welfare and sanitation, state and local government - safety, state and local government - other, shipments from advertising, input-output code corresponding to census code in variable one, number of census industries corresponding to input-output industry in variable 20, value of shipments for census industry in variable 1, value of shipments for census industries counted in variable 21. The source for this information is from: U.S. Bureau of the Census. Census of Manufactures, 1963 Subject Statistics: Size of establishments.</p>\r\n<p>The 1972 dataset includes numerous variables from the 1972 Bureau of Economic Analysis Input-Output study. This data has been arranged by SIC so that the dataset conforms to other datasets such as concentration ratios, which are arranged by SIC. This data can be used to calculate variables such as the fraction of a commodity's sales that go to consumers, government, etc.  Data on imports will be useful as a supplement to the domestic concentration ratios, and the advertising sales variable will be of interest as well.  There are 450 records; one for each of the 1972 SIC Manufacturing Industries. Variables include: SIC code, SIC name, Total output of the commodity whose input-output is given later in the record, total sales of this commodity to industries, total sales of this commodity to final consumers, total investment purchases of this commodity by industries for investment purposes, total sales of this commodity to industries engaging in fixed capital expenditures, net change in inventories of this commodity, total sales of this commodity to foreign buyers, total sales of this commodity to all levels of government, total sales of this commodity to the federal government, total sales of the commodity to the federal government for defense purposes, total sales of the commodity to the federal government for non-defense purposes, total sales to state and local government, total sales to state and local government for educational purposes, total sales to state and local government for health and welfare, total sales to state and local government for safety purposes, total sales to state and local government that do not fall into other categories, total purchases of advertising by this industry, total value of imports of this commodity, the input-output code associated with the data defined in this record, the number of SIC industries included in the input-output code, the value of shipments of the SIC, the value of shipments of the SIC's included in the input-output industry, and the total value of shipments of the input-output industry.
