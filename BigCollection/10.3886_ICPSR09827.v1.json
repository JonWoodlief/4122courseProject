All hospitals with fewer than 1,000 beds were stratified, the   primary stratum depending on size and geographic region. Within each of   these 24 primary strata, the allocation of the hospitals was made   through a controlled selection technique so that hospitals in the   sample would be properly distributed with regard to type of ownership   and geographic division. Sample hospitals were drawn with probabilities   ranging from certainty for the largest hospitals to 1 in 40 for the   smallest hospitals. Of the 497 hospitals in the sample, 424 were in   scope and agreed to participate. The within-hospital sampling ratio for   selecting sample discharges varied inversely with the probability of   selection of the hospital. The smallest sampling fraction of discharged   patients was taken in the largest hospitals, and the largest fraction   was taken in the smallest hospitals. In nearly all hospitals, the daily   listing sheet of discharges was the frame from which the subsamples of   discharges were selected within the sample hospitals. The sample   discharges were selected by a random technique, usually on the basis of   the terminal digit(s) of the patient's medical record number, which was  assigned when the patient was admitted."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"National Hospital Discharge Survey, 1973","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38000,"dataFile":{"id":2632438,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"National Hospital Discharge Survey, 1973","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
