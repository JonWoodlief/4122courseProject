Respondents were asked whether they  approved of President Bill Clinton's handling of foreig\nn policy, the  economy, health care reform, the budget deficit, and crime. Questions  also covered respondents' opinions regarding how important the crises  in Haiti, Rwanda, and North Korea were to United States interests and  whether they approved of Clinton's handling of the situations. The  issue of spousal abuse/domestic violence was also addressed in detail,  with specific reference to the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Respondents  were asked how serious a problem they thought wife abuse was in this  country, and whether the police treated cases of domestic violence  seriously enough, or if police were more likely to treat domestic  violence as just a family matter. Other issues addressed included  the space exploration program and the use of United States military  troops in other countries. Background information on respondents  includes voter registration status, household composition, vote choice  in the 1992 presidential election, political party, political  orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
