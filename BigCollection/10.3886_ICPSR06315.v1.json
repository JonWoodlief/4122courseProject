In addition to describing the overall  contours of the conduct of research in United States police agencies,  this study also sought to explore the organizational dynamics that  might contribute to understanding the different roles research plays  in various types of police organizations. Questionnaires were mailed  in 1990 to 777 sheriff, municipal, county, and state police agencies  selected for this study, resulting in 491 surveys for  analysis. Respondents were asked to identify the extent to which they  were involved in each of 26 distinct topic areas within the past year,  to specify the five activities that consumed most of their time during  the previous year, and to describe briefly any projects currently  being undertaken that might be of interest to other police agencies.

One part of the survey consisted of a series  of questions asking respondents to identify the topics on which they  worked during the past year. In another approach, a series of  questions addressed methods and resources employed in the course of  doing research. The third technique was to ask respondents to indicate  their agreement or disagreement with a series of statements that  characterized the nature of research as it was practiced in their  agencies. In formulating the questions, a list of topic areas was  prepared from the researchers' own experience in planning and research  that was supplemented with results from early pretesting on a small  number of agencies not in the national sample. Surveys were mailed  during the last two weeks in August 1990 to each of the 777 police  agencies selected, resulting in 491 surveys for analysis. In October  1990, all police agencies that had not returned a questionnaire were  sent a follow-up letter requesting return of the survey. The survey  instrument was offered to agencies in two formats: one that phrased  questions in terms of \"the research and planning unit,\" and another  that phrased questions in terms of \"those responsible for research  and planning.\" Agencies were instructed to choose the first format if  they had a formal research and planning unit, the second if they did not."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Respondents were first asked to identify the extent  to which they were involved in each of 26 distinct topic areas within  the past year and next to describe their research topics by listing  the five activities that consumed most of their time during the  year. Another question asked respondents to describe briefly any  projects currently being undertaken that might be of interest to other  police agencies. A second approach sought to describe police research  not in terms of the agenda of top\nics studied but in terms of the  methods police used to study those topics. Five questions queried  respondents on various aspects of the methods of police research. A  third section called for respondents to react to a series of ten  statements characterizing the nature of research as practiced in their  agencies. Another section probed for information about the  characteristics of those responsible for research in their agency,  such as whether the research staff reported to the agency head and, if  not, to whom they reported. To determine what initiates police  research in the police agencies surveyed, respondents were asked to  evaluate on a 4-point scale the degree to which 14 factors played a  role in initiating research in their agencies. In assessing the impact  of research on police agencies, the researchers relied on six  questions. The mix and phrasing of these questions were designed to  control and minimize the phenomenon of inflating the actual impact of research."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement agencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police departments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"research"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
