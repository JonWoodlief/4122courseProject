Specifically, the study coded 7,217 articles on arts-and-cultures at 17 metropolitan newspapers and 1,530 articles from three national daily newspapers. Cities were selected for inclusion in the study based on their geography and size and an interest in comparing cities with and without established arts scenes, broad arts presence, and newspaper competition.

Reporting the Arts II: Sections [2003] analyzed 4,036 sections of 583 separate issues of 20 newspapers during the month of October 2003. National newspapers included in the study were The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today. Metropolitan newspapers included in the study were the Charlotte Observer, Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Denver Post, Rocky Mountain News, Houston Chronicle, Miami Herald, Philadelphia Daily News, Philadelphia Inquirer, Portland Oregonian, Providence Journal, Contra Costa Times, Oakland Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, and the San Jose Mercury News.

The first was assigned the task of locating the arts-and-culture articles and listings; the second revisited the same newspaper as a double check and performed the coding data entry. Data were entered in a custom-written online interface, which contained built-in error checks to screen for illegal codes and ineligible newspaper sections. A field was designated to flag articles whose inclusion or exclusion was ambiguous, and they were resolved by the project's research analyst. The verbal description of each article was checked to make sure that it conformed with its code. For a double check all articles with the same code were grouped and proofread by coders to flag inconsistencies in categorization. Because any coder error in long articles would have a disproportionate effect on the findings, items of outlying length were coded twice.  Every section of each newspaper was scrutinized for articles and listings on arts and culture. Excluded were stories on culture in the sociological sense: food and drink, religion, philosophy, education, and the humanities. Non-arts media storie\ns were excluded: non-entertainment television, including news, sports, and advertising; magazines; other journalism; spectator sports; consumer fashion; media business; Internet; Web site and online media; technology; consumer electronics; and telecommunications. The cities and newspapers scrutinized in this study do not, statistically speaking, amount to an accurate portrayal of American arts journalism. Other clusters of case studies might have yielded somewhat different results. The quantitative content analysis at the heart of this study, and especially over-time comparisons, are subject to error. Obtaining, filing, examining, and coding thousands of articles in hundreds of papers amounts to a complicated process rife with opportunities for mistakes. These are compounded when measurements happen at two points in time and are made by different groups of coders. The published report has emphasized only trends that were discernible even when accounting for a double margin of error. The researchers are confident, though, that the larger picture of transforming newsrooms and communities is accurate for the country as whole today.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers chose to conduct the content analysis during October because it is a busy time for arts coverage. The cities and the papers -- which were picked to encompass a wide range of types -- add up to an illustrative cross section of communities and news organizations, analyzed at the peak of their annual performance. The month of October should have resulted in 584 separate issues of the 20 newspapers in the study, however the Oakland Tribune of October 6 was missing. A few issues were delivered with missing sections (33 sections were missing in total). Ten of the missing sections were specialist arts sections. As a consequence, the data are somewhat understated for The Plain Dealer (missing one weekend supplement), The Houston Chronicle (missing one weekend supplement), The Oakland Tribune (missing two weekend supplements and the October 6 daily arts and leisure section), The Oregonian (missing one weekend supplement and two daily arts and leisure sections), and The Providence Journal (missing one daily arts and leisure section).</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Each article was classified according to the following attributes: prominence in the newspaper, byline (staffer, freelancer, syndicated columnist, or newswire), length, focus (local, national, etc.), type of article, and the artistic discipline covered.
