The surveys assessed farmers perceptions of climate change and actions taken to cope with the changes, as well as associated socio-economic information and crop diversity for the household. The purpose for collecting the data was to investigate whether there are differences between genders in the use of crop diversity to cope with climate change (Activity #2). Questions concerning the relevance of crops for adapting to climate change will be used to build a database on indigenous knowledge and resilient crops and varieties (Activity #1). Questions concerning seed sources for regular and climate change resistant crops shed some light on the effectivenss of the local seed flow for climate change adaptation (Activity #3). The datasets for Sarawak and Bolivia are complete but the datasets from Nepal and India are incomplete in that data from several sites are still being collected.\t  Questionnaires were carried out as interviews  with the farmer, typically the head of household. In Sarawak all farmers in 5 villages were interviewed. Whereas in other locations a sampling protocol was used. Surveys were performed by local partner institutions: Proinpa (Bolivia, Li-bird (Nepal), MSSRF (India), and SIAS (Malaysia)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"climatic change * traditional farming * crops * * rice * potatoes * resistance to temperature extremes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AGROVOC"},"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://aims.fao.org/standards/agrovoc"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neglected and underutilized species * NUS * indigenous communities * seed systems * resilience"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bioversity International"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bioversity International"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.bioversityinternational.org/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bioversity International"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.bioversityinternational.org/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Household/Survey data"]},{"typeName":"otherReferences","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["CRP 7: CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bolivia, Malaysia, India, Nepal"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bolivia (Cochabamba and La Paz) Malaysia (Sarawak)"}}]}]}},"files":[]}}}
