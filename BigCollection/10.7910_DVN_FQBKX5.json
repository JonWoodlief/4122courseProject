ECMWF, the data provider and developer, defines their methods of reanalysis as follows: “Reanalysis (as well as analysis) is a process by which model information and observations of many different sorts are combined in an optimal way to produce a consistent, global best estimate of the various atmospheric, wave and oceanographic parameters.”\r\nhttp://www.ecmwf.int/en/how-are-data-obtained-do-they-come-observations-or-have-they-been-derived-numerical-models\r\nExtent downloaded: (degrees)\r\nN: 2 W: 27 S: -5 E: 36\r\nResolution downloaded: (degrees)\r\n0.125 x 0.125 (approx. 14km at the equator).
