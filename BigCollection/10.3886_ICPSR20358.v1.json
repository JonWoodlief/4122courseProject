During the study's planning phase, an instrument was drafted for use in extracting this information. Each site provided copies of the forms\nthat are routinely included in court files to help guide the instrument development. A draft form was distributed to UFC administrators and staff at each site for their review and comments. The form underwent four rounds of major revisions based on their feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Data collectors were recruited from former UFC staff and current and former non-UFC court staff. All data collectors were trained by the principal investigator in the use of the data collection form. The vast majority of all data extraction required a manual review of paper files. Maricopa County did not maintain separate UFC files after cases closed. As a result, data collectors had to locate and review files from multiple courts (domestic relations, juvenile, etc.). In addition, the multi-case nature of these families meant that there were far more files than families under review. The 406 UFC families in the study had 1,399 cases requiring review and the 196 non-UFC families had 712 cases requiring review. As forms were returned, project staff reviewed them for consistency and completeness and followed through with data collectors, as needed, to improve data collection quality in general and to clarify data on specific cases.</p>\n\n<p>In order to increase comparability across the sites, cases were drawn from approximately the same time period at each court. The time period selected was after the state had adopted legislation that was in compliance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA). This was done to ensure that any differences observed among the sites in the processing of dependency cases were not attributable to different legislative mandates among the states. The time period was also selected to allow a minimum of one year to elapse between the entry into the UFC and data collection. This provided the greatest opportunity to collect outcome data for all of the UFC cases. At all three sites, a few cases in the sample universe had to be eliminated because the files were sealed, otherwise unavailable for review, or contained incomplete data.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>Variables in this dataset are organized into the following categories: background variables, items from dependency/abuse and neglect filings, delinquency filings, domestic relations/probate filings, civil domestic violence/protection order filings, criminal domestic violence filings, criminal child abuse filings, other criminal filings, and variables from a summary across cases.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically, the final version collects information about the family, including basic demographic information and a summary of the family's current and prior involvement in the justice system.
