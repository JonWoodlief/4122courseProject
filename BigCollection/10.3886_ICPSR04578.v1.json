The study used data collected by the Bureau of  Justice Statistics (BJS), available as RECIDIVISM OF PRISONERS  RELEASED IN 1994: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 3355), which tracked a sample  of 38,624 prisoners released from prison in 15 states in 1994 over a  period of three years. The data consist of information on each  releasee's entire officially recorded criminal history. This includes  all recorded adult arrests through the end of the follow-up  period. These data were obtained from state and Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) automated RAP sheets and include arrest,  adjudication, and sentencing information. Each arrest event includes  information on adjudication and sentencing related to that event, if  such action was taken. The data also include some demographic  information, type of release from prison, and type of admission into  prison. However, this information is only available for the 1994  release and not for all prior (or future) arrest events. This data  collection consists of the syntax for a SAS macro used to estimate  individual offending trajectories. Individuals that had some problem  in their arrest history records or were not included in the BJS report  were not included in the analysis sample. Arrest records were  restructured into a hierarchical person-event-level file. Arrest  events of each person were clustered in chronological order. The  arrest histories were then truncated after the first post-release  re-arrest event. For those persons that were not arrested after release, the arrest age was set to the age at censoring."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The key independent variables used in estimating  the pre-release criminal history accumulation process included the  arrest number, the age at first arrest, whether or not the individual  was confined as a result of the previous arrest event, and a measure  of the number of years taken to reach each arrest event cumulated  through the last arrest event.
