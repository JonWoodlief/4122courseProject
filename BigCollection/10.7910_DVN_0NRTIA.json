Despite being in the weak absorption regime, the experimental level of LH current drive is successfully simulated, by taking into account the variations in the parallel wavenumber due to the toroidal effect. The effect of radial transport of the fast LH electrons in EAST has also been studied, which shows that a modest amount of radial transport diffusion can redistribute the fast LH current significantly. Taking advantage of the new capability in GENRAY, the actual Scrape Off Layer (SOL) model with magnetic field, density, temperature, and geometry is included in the simulation for both the lower and the higher density cases, so that the collisional losses of Lower Hybrid Wave (LHW) power in the SOL has been accounted for, which together with fast electron losses can reproduce the LHCD experimental observations in different discharges of EAST. We have also analyzed EAST discharges where there is a significant ohmic contribution to the total current, and good agreement with experiment in terms of total current has been obtained. Also, the full‐wave code TORLH has been used for the simulation of the LH physics in the EAST, including full‐wave effects such as diffraction and focusing which may also play an important role in bridging the spectral gap. The comparisons between the GENRAY and the TORLH codes are done for both the Maxwellian and the quasi‐linear electron Landau damping cases. These simulations represent an important addition to the validation studies of the GENRAY‐CQL3D and TORLH models being used in weak absorption scenarios of tokamaks with large aspect ratio."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer simulations"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"EAST"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"experiments"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"lower hybrid current drive"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tokamaks"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/14ja/14ja080/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-14-80</a><br /><br />This work was supported in part by DoE Contract No. DE-SC0010492."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"14ja080_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149500,"dataFile":{"id":3344787,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"14ja080_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":876120,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1684de6929f-795f796bd5d4","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1b0fc8bd68db94df5673dc5b639e15a0","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1b0fc8bd68db94df5673dc5b639e15a0"}}}]}}}
