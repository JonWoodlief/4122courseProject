The project attempted to examine  more closely the relationships among inmate characteristics, treatment  process, and treatment outcomes than previous studies in order to  explore critical issues in prison-based drug treatment programming and  policies. Researchers examined in-treatment measures and multiple  post-release outcomes for inmates who participated in TC drug  treatment programs or comparison groups at five state prisons:  Graterford, Houtzdale, Cresson, Waymart, and Huntingdon. Matched  comparison groups were made up of TC-eligible inmates who participated  in less intensive forms of treatment (e.g., short-term drug education  and outpatient treatment groups) due to a shortage of intensive  treatment slots at the five institutions. Included in the treatment  sample were all current TC residents as of January 1, 2000. New  subjects were added to the study as they were admitted to treatment  programs. Between January 1 and November 30, 2000, data on all inmates  admitted to or discharged from alcohol or drug treatment programs were  collected on a monthly basis. Monthly tracking was continued  throughout the study to determine treatment outcomes (e.g., successful  vs. unsuccessful). TC clients were asked to complete additional  self-report measures that tapped psychological constructs and inmate  perceptions of the treatment experience, and TC counselors were asked  to complete periodic reassessments of each inmate's participation in  treatment. Self-reports of treatment process and psychological  functioning were gathered within 30 days after admission, again after  six months, again at the end of 12 months, and again at discharge if  the inmate remained in TC longer than 12 months. Counselor ratings of  inmate participation in treatment were similarly gathered one month,  six months, and 12 months following admission to treatment. After  release, both treatment and comparison groups were tracked over time  to monitor rearrest, reincarceration, drug use, and employment.

(3) Were inmates  with different levels and types of need matched with appropriate  treatment? (4) To what degree did appropriate assessment and program  placement moderate treatment effects?

Matched  comparison groups were made up of TC-eligible inmates who participated  in less intensive forms of treatment (e.g., short-term drug education  and outpatient treatment groups) due to a shortage of intensive  treatment slots at the five institutions. The comparison groups were  constructed based upon known predictors such as drug dependency, need  for treatment, and criminal history. Process and outcome measures  incorporated a range of institutional measures (e.g., misconducts),  intermediate measures (e.g., attitudinal and behavioral change,  participation in treatment), and post-release measures (e.g., drug  relapse, rearrest and reincarceration, employment, levels of parole  supervision). In order to create adequate comparison groups, formal  classification assessments and drug and alcohol assessments were  conducted on all inmates. The average scores on the Pennsylvania  Department of Corrections Screening Instrument (PACSI) and the Texas  Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen were examined for inmates in  each program to determine how many inmates fell into low, medium, and  high need categories. Because a shortage of space precluded  intensively treating all those who were assessed with a high need for  alcohol or other drug (AOD) treatment, a large pool of eligible  offenders assigned to less intensive forms of treatment (e.g.,  outpatient treatment, drug education, or ancillary groups) was  accessible for inclusion in the matched comparison sample. Included in  the treatment sample were all current TC residents as of January 1,  2000. New subjects were added to the study as they were admitted to  treatment programs. For each inmate admitted to an AOD treatment  program during the study period, researchers collected the treatment  start date, the discharge date, and the treatment outcome. Between  January 1 and November 30, 2000, data on all inmates admitted to or  discharged from alcohol or drug treatment programs were collected on a  monthly basis. Monthly tracking was continued throughout the study to  determine treatment outcomes (e.g., successful vs. unsuccessful). TC  clients were asked to complete additional self-report measures that  tapped psychological constructs and inmate perceptions of the  treatment experience, and TC counselors were asked to complete  periodic reassessments of each inmate's participation in treatment.

Counselor ratings of inmate participation in\ntreatment  were similarly gathered one month, six months, and 12 months following  admission to treatment. Standardized drug scores were calculated based  on the inmate's TCU Drug Screen score, if available, or the inmate's  PACSI score, if the TCU was not available. Because the TCU is a 0-9  scale, and the PACSI is a 0-10 scale, scores were transformed into  standardized z-scores. After release, both treatment and comparison  groups were tracked over time to monitor rearrest, reincarceration,  drug use, and employment. Inmates were informed that their  participation in the research was voluntary, and they were asked to  sign a Subject Consent Form. The researchers retained the  responsibility to maintain the security and confidentiality of all  information obtained from the inmates during all data collection and  analyses. At the time of the creation of this dataset, 247 TC inmates  and 809 Comparison inmates had been released from prison, with follow-up periods extending up to 18 months."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Measures can be broken down into the following four  categories and their sources: (1) Inmates Background Factors were  collected from the Pennsylvania Additive Classification System (PACT),  the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Screening Instrument  (PACSI), and the TCU (Texas Christian University) Drug Screen.
