To that  end, the initiative worked to (1) improve access to prenatal care  and strengthen effective parenting, (2) improve the quality of child  care, and (3) strengthen and sustain positive involvement of fathers  in their children's lives. As part of the evaluation, a baseline  community survey and surveys of childcare providers were conducted and  births records were obtained from the New Jersey State Department of  Health.</p>\n\n<p>Extracted from New Jersey vital events public-use data files,  Datasets 1-3 contain information on births during 2001-2004 to women  in Trenton and, for comparison, two New Jersey cities not covered by  the intervention, Camden and Newark. The birth records data include  sex, birth order, birth weight, gestational age, one-minute and  five-minute APGAR scores, month of pregnancy when prenatal care began,  number of prenatal visits, weight gained during pregnancy, medical  risk factors for the pregnancy, obstetric procedures performed,  delivery complications, congenital anomalies and abnormalities,  mother's marital status and number of live births now living, and the  parents' age, race, Hispanic origin, state/country of birth, and  education.</p>\n\n<p>Dataset 4 contains data from the baseline community survey, which  in 2002 interviewed the primary caregivers of children aged 0-5 in  Trenton households. The survey collected information about child and  parental health, parenting practices, fathers' involvement in their  children's lives, health insurance and health care utilization,  attendance at parenting groups or classes, and utilization of child  care. Additional information collected by the baseline survey includes  United States nativity, year of immigration, race, Hispanic origin,  education, employment status, alcohol use, illicit drug use, earnings,  and household income.</p>\n\n<p>Datasets 5-7 contain data from the childcare provider surveys  conducted in 2003, 2004, and 2005, which collected information about  the teachers and childcare providers in the Trenton childcare centers  that were participating in Children's Futures. Respondents were  questioned about their work experience, age, race, place of residence  (ZIP code), education, credentials, position held and hours worked,  languages spoken, salary/hourly rate for the job at the center,  childcare training and practices, opinions about center staffing  levels, and beliefs about how to help infants and toddlers learn and  grow. In addition, the respondents were asked how prepared they were  to work with infants or toddlers with certain conditions such as  emotional disturbances, attention deficit disorder or attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), fetal alcohol syndrome, asthma, severe allergies, and developmental delays.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child rearing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child welfare"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preschool children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA V.

Eligible parents and/or guardians in Trenton  were sampled from two distinct lists--one that was screened for  households with at least one child aged five or less, and a larger  list of Trenton households that was not screened for eligibility.  One-hundred fifty-nine completed English language interviews were  obtained from the 751 households that were dialed from the screened  list. Once the screened list was exhausted, households in the  unscreened list were contacted. In total, 7,677 telephone numbers were  dialed from the unscreened list, resulting in 340 completed English  language interviews. Additionally, 580 cases from the screened and  unscreened lists were identified as requiring a Spanish interviewer.  Of these, 127 resulted in a completed Spanish interview. Finally,  staff from the Children's Futures initiative posted flyers at city  community and health care centers, which described the study and  provided a toll-free number to participate in the survey. A total of  28 interviews were completed with respondents who called into the  toll-free line.</p>\n\n<p>The Trenton, New Jersey Childcare Provider Surveys attempted to  interview all teachers and childcare providers at the centers involved  with Children's Futures.
