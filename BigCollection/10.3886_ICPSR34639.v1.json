Easy to use data products will accelerate meaningful comparative effectiveness research (CER).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Methods:</strong>\nThis project used data from the Medicare Chronic Condition Data Warehouse for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or stroke in 2007 with two-year follow-up and one-year pre-admission baseline. The project joined over 100 raw data files per condition to create research-ready person- and service-level analytic files, code templates, and macros while at the same time adding uniformity in measures of comorbid conditions and other covariates. The data product was tested in a project on statin effectiveness in older patients with multiple comorbidities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results:</strong>\nA programmer/analyst with no administrative claims data experience was able to use the data product to create an analytic dataset with minimal support aside from the documentation provided. Analytic dataset creation used the conditions, procedures, and timeline macros provided. The data structure created for AMI adapted successfully for stroke. Complexity increased and statin treatment decreased with age. The two-year survival benefit of statins post-AMI increased with age.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>\nClaims data can be made more user-friendly for CER research on complex conditions.  The data product should be expanded by refreshing the cohort and increasing follow-up.

The complex cardiovascular disease (CVD) patient is of particular concern. Over 38 million American adults over age 60 are living with CVD. Despite recent declines, CVD remains the leading cause of death in the United States. In 2006, coronary heart disease (CHD) caused one of every six deaths, and stroke was the third leading cause of death in both men and women. CVD is the leading cause of death after age 65, with 67 percent of CVD events in this age group. Several evidence-based drug therapies have been shown to reduce CVD risk, including statin therapy. Physicians frequently do not adhere to national cholesterol guidelines and they are often reluctant to aggressively treat the elderly with CVD, especially those ≥75 years of age. However, the degree to which co-existing conditions contribute to gaps in guideline adherence is not known. Moreover, virtually no clinical trial data are available from individuals ≥80 years of age for evidence-based guidelines in this age group.</p>\n\n<p>The Enhanced Data to Accelerate Complex Patient Comparative Effectiveness Research project was funded through an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) R24 grant (R24HS01944D-01) in order to address these important gaps that remain in the literature. To accelerate the use of Medicare data by analysts, the University of Iowa (UI) and Buccaneer, A General Dynamics Company have produced a data product based on Medicare administrative data contained in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW). This data product, developed as a collaboration between UI CER scientists and Buccaneer methodologists, consists of an easy to use suite of analytical files and accompanying pre-coded variables and algorithms that compress over 100 raw Medicare data files into streamlined longitudinal person-level and summary service-level analytical files. These files are subject to the same data use agreement (DUA) requirements with CMS that the agency has for all research identifiable Medicare administrative files.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>To create the data product, data for Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and/or treated in the Emergencey Department (ED) with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in 2007 were manipulated to produce analytic files for comparative effectiveness studies in patients with multiple chronic illnesses (referred to as complex patients). It i\ns the hope of the investigators/developers that access to researcher-ready data files will enhance CER capacity.
