The  study consisted of telephone interviews conducted in the spring of  2002 with 177 employers who had advertised entry-level openings in the  prior six months. The survey included questions about the company,  such as size, industry, employee turnover, and racial composition,  questions about hiring procedures, questions about the last worker  hired for a position not requiring a college degree, and questions  about the employer's attitude toward various kinds of marginalized  workers. An emphasis in the survey was placed on assessing employers'  attitudes about and experience with applicants with criminal histories."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study investigated how and why employers   make the hiring decisions they do.

(2) How   does the type of crime or the context of the sanction affect   employers' evaluations of applicants with criminal records? (3) What   kinds of formal screens do employers use to evaluate applicants for   entry-level jobs? and (4) How do the characteristics of the job, the   applicant pool, the customer base, and the company (location, size,   industry, etc.) affect employers' willingness to consider applicants  with criminal records?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data consist of 177 completed telephone interviews  with employers. The survey was administered by the Michigan State   Survey Center. Calls were made to each establishment, asking to speak   with the person in charge of hiring. The baseline survey instrument   was developed by Harry Holzer et al. (1996, 2002). It includes   questions about the company, such as size, industry, employee   turnover, and racial composition, questions about hiring procedures,   questions about the last worker hired for a position not requiring a   college degree, and questions about the employer's attitude toward   various kinds of marginalized workers. In addition, several vignette   items were added to assess employers' reactions to applicants   convicted of different types of crimes or who had received different   types of sanctions.
