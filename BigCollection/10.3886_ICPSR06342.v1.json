The 1991 NHPI was a   two-part survey with two separate questionnaires. One questionnaire was   sent to nursing homes and board\nand care homes (Facility File), while   the other was sent to home health agencies and hospices (Agency File).   Data on services provided to individuals at their residences (also   included in the Agency File) were gathered as well, and thus the NHPI   represents an expansion over earlier versions of the study (the   Inventory of Long-Term Care Places, conducted in 1986, and the National   Master Facility Inventory, conducted eight times between 1967 and   1982). Variables in the Facility File include name and address of   facility, age group primarily served, disability group primarily   served, ownership type, total beds, and number of residents by age and   sex.
