While Mexican immigrants are the largest population of immigrants in the United States (39 percent), the rest of the population is widely varied, with no one nation accounting for more than 3 percent of all immigrants.

This study is an exploratory study in two cities which reflect the diversity of experience with immigration across the country: Denver, Colorado and surrounding areas, where the focus is on Mexican immigrants, and Portland, Maine and surrounding areas, where the focus is on three of the many refugee populations which have newly settled here. The contrasts, not only in the immigrant populations themselves, but also in the political and historical contexts of the communities in which they live, offer an opportunity to enrich the field of research on child care choices for this vulnerable population of children and families.</p>\n<p>Additional details about this study can be found on the New Americans\n<a href=\"http://muskie.usm.maine.edu/newamericans/index.html\">http://muskie.usm.maine.edu/newamericans/index.html</a>\nWeb site.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The purpose of the Child Care provider survey was to learn from early care and education providers about the following issues:\n<ul>\n<li>experience serving immigrant/refugee families</li>\n<li>challenges expected and experienced</li>\n<li>accommodations made for families</li>\n<li>communication with families</li>\n<li>level of parent involvement</li>\n<li>concerns about and opportunities to serve  immigrant/refugee families</li>\n<li>expanding child care choices for immigrant/refugee families</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p>A brief survey was designed to assess training needs on immigrant and refugee issues in child care and beliefs about English language acquisition.</p>\n\n<p>A K-2 Teacher survey was designed for kindergarten, first grade, and second grade teachers to obtain their perceptions about the impact of attendance in early care and education programs on the school readiness of children from these populations.The survey asked teachers about the following:\n<ul>\n<li>experience with teaching immigrant/refugee children</li>\n<li>efficacy of ELL instruction currently provided</li>\n<li>knowledge about the cultures of families</li>\n<li>interactions with and accommodations for immigrant/refugee families</li>\n<li>influence of preschool on school performance</li>\n<li>expected and encountered challenges with teaching ELL students</li>\n<li>knowledge of English language acquisition</li>\n<li>related training received</li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p>This study attempts to understand refugee and immigrant families' beliefs about and experiences with child care, and how these factors impact their decision-making processes.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p><strong>Child care provider surveys</strong></p>\n\n<p>The study was designed to be administered to early care and education providers.

The longer survey was sent by mail and email to a list of providers supplied by local child care resource and referral agencies. The brief survey was administered over a three-month period to all providers that attended regularly scheduled training sessions. The brief survey was only administered in Maine as permission could not be obtained to administer the survey at training sites in Colorado. Because the brief survey was handed out at training sessions, the responses are more representative of providers who are likely to seek out and attend training. Surveys were sent with a cover letter twice, with a month between the mailings. To increase the response rate in Colorado, the Colorado Division of Child Care agreed to have the cover letter printed on their letterhead and signed by the director of the division.
