Data  collected in this study measured the amount of time that people spent  doing various activities in 2005, such as paid work, child care,  religious activities, volunteering, and socializing. Respondents were  randomly selected from households that had completed their final month  of the Current Population Survey (CPS), and were interviewed two to  five months after their household's last CPS interview. Respondents  were interviewed only once and reported their activities for the  24-hour period from 4 a.m. on the day before the interview until 4  a.m. on the day of the interview. Respondents indicated the total  number of minutes spent on each activity, including where they were  and whom they were with. Except for secondary child care, data on  activities done simultaneously with primary activities were not  collected. Part 1, Respondent and Activity Summary File, contains  demographic information about respondents and a summary of the total  amount of time they spent doing each activity that day. Part 2,  Roster File, contains information about household members and   nonhousehold children under the age of 18. Part 3, Activity File,  includes additional information on activities in which respondents  participated, including the location of each activity and the total  time spent on secondary child care. Part 4, Who File, includes data on  who was present during each activity. Part 5, ATUS-CPS 2005 File,  contains data on respondents and members of their household collected  two to five months prior to the ATUS interviews during their  participation in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Parts 6-10  contain supplemental data files that can be used for further analysis  of the data. Part 6, Case History File, contains information about the  interview process, such as identifiers and interview outcome codes.  Part 7, Call History File, gives information about each call attempt,  including the call date and outcome. Part 8, Trips File, provides  information about the number, duration, and purpose of overnight trips  away from home for two or more nights in a row. Part 9, Replicate  Weights File I, contains base weights, replicated base weight\ns, and   replicate final weights for each case that was selected to be   interviewed for ATUS, while Part 10, Replicate Weights File II,   contains replicate weights that were generated using the 2006   weighting method.

Unweighted data are not representative of the population due to differences between population groups in both sampling and nonresponse. ATUS weight variables include the ATUS final weight (TUFINLWGT), which indicates the number of person-days the respondent represents, the ATUS base weight (TUBWGT), and a ATUS final weight based on 2006 weighting methodology (TU06FWGT). ATUS weights were selected from the Current Population Survey (CPS), and CPS weights (after the first-stage adjustment) are the basis for the ATUS weights. These base weights were adjusted to account for the fact that less populous states were not oversampled in ATUS, as they were in the CPS. Further adjustments were made to account for the probability of selecting each household within the ATUS sampling strata and the probability of selecting each person from each sample household. Part 9 contains replicate weights for the variable TUFINLWGT, as well as base weights, while Part 10 contains replicate weights for the variable TU06FWGT. ATUS replicate weights were based on the replicate weights developed for the CPS. ATUS began with the CPS replicate weight after the first-stage ratio adjustment, and each replicate was processed through all of the stages of the ATUS weighting procedure. The CPS replicate weights were based on a modified balanced half-sample method of replication, developed in the 1980s by Robert Fay.
