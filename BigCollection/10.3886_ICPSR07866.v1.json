Six major areas of concern  were examined in this study: (1) the appropriateness of  placement/admission and discharge, plus possible alternatives, (2) the  quality of life within the institutional environment, (3) the  residents' rights and legal status, (4) the medical and non-medical  services provided and needed, (5) the sources of financing such care,  and (6) the impact of government programs and policies upon the costs  and provision of certain types of service. This information was  collected from 9,090 residents of 851 institutions and from 3,289 of  their family members. Administrative staff at each resident's facility  also provided information about that facility as well as the sampled  resident. Data about the resident's institution include its basic  characteristics, e.g., type of care provided, ownership, number of  beds, occupancy rate, and services and programs offered. Resident data  include basic social and demographic characteristics, reason for  institutionalization, cost of care, current activities, type of  treatment, and the physical limitations of the institutional  population. Family data examine the next of kin's relationship to the  resident, e.g., relative's proximity to the institution, frequency of  visits, and monetary contributions to the resident, as well as the  next of kin's demographic characteristics and views of the resident and his or her institutionalization."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adolescents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alternatives

It was a three-stage design encompassing,  respectively, a sample of institution\ns, a sample of residents within  the selected institutions, and a subsample of the families of the  selected residents. Each stage of selection constituted a national  probability sample. A design objective of the survey was to provide  statistical information of roughly comparable reliability for each of  18 strata of institutions, i.e., six types of facilities by three size  categories. In effect, therefore, 18 independent samples were selected  and interviewed. The basic frame from which the institution sample was  taken was the 1973 Master Facility Inventory. In general, within each  of the 18 strata, institutions were chosen systematically with  probability proportionate to their sizes, i.e., the number of  beds. Some strata contained relatively few institutions, in which case  all the institutions were included in the sample with certainty. Penal  and juvenile detention facilities were excluded from the sampling  because they serve as incarceration institutions rather than personal care institutions."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"National Survey of Institutionalized Persons, 1976","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35209,"dataFile":{"id":2610625,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"National Survey of Institutionalized Persons, 1976","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
