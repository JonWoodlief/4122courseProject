The Master Sample is based on the 1996 Population Census enumerator areas and the estimated number of dwelling units from the 1996 Population Census. The EAs were grouped within a province by urban/rural, and a disproportional sample of EAs was taken from each group (stratum). Within each explicit stratum the PSUs were stratified by simply arranging them in geographical order by District Council, Magisterial District\r\nand, within the magisterial district, by average household income (for formal urban areas and hostels) or EA.\r\nThe allocated number of EAs was systematically selected with probability proportional to size in each stratum.
