Of the 25 women enrolled in the course, 21 voluntarily completed all of the instruments. A comparison group of 21 women who were taking graduate courses in education also completed the Attitudes Toward Women Survey, and the modified version of the Osgood's Semantic Differential. The Semantic Differential was also administered to 85 students in graduate education courses in Boston, MA.\r\n<br /><br />  A questionnaire was distributed on the first day of the seminar. It was designed to assess demographic information, perceptions of personal roles, awareness of role conflicts, attitudes and values on a variety of other topics, and the current salience of these issues. A 27-item housekeeping checklist assessed \"division of labor\" in their homes.<br /><br />  Respondents were asked to complete Englehard's Attitudes Toward Women Survey, a questionnaire that assesses attitudes toward childrearing, discriminatory practices, education, and the nature of work appropriate for women. An additional questionnaire was administered to all subjects to assess their self-concept. A follow-up evaluation questionnaire was mailed to all of the respondents four months after the completion of the seminar. This included both open-ended and precoded items designed to collect additional background data on respondents, evaluation of the workshop, and the influences of the workshop on role satisfactions and feeling of role competence.\r\n<br /><br />  At the conclusion of the workshop, 27 hours of the taped class discussion were transcribed. A rudimentary content analysis was performed by the investigator. The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (paper data, audiotapes of workshop discussions).
