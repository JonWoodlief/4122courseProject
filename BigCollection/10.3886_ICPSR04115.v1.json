However, the difference between family and intimate partner and  stranger/acquaintance murders as a function of place, specifically the  degree of urbanicity or rurality, remained to be explored. This  research project examined rural and urban trends in family and  intimate partner homicide for the 20-year period from 1980 through  1999. The construct of place served as a backdrop against which  changes in trends in family/partner homicide were tracked, and against  which various independent measures that purportedly explain variation  in the rates were tested. \"Place\" was operationalized by population  and proximity to a metropolitan area. The overall research questions  were: (1) How do the rates of family and intimate partner murder  differ by place -- specifically, by a place's population size and  proximity to a metropolitan area? and (2) What are the independent  measures that explain the differences in rates by place, and how do  those measures affect changes over time? Finding some support for the  hypothesis that family and intimate partner murders are more prevalent  in rural than urban communities, an additional question emerged: (3)  Did any of these factors worsen over time in rural communities within the time period of interest?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For this study, intimate partners were defined as  current and former spouses (including common-law) and current and  former boyfriends and girlfriends (including same-sex relationships).  Family members were defined as parents, siblings, aunts/uncles,  stepparents and stepchildren, in-laws, and \"other\" family. The project  merged data from several sources. The offender data file from the  Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Supplementary Homicide Report  (SH\nR) series for 1980 through 1999 was the primary data source. These  agency-level data contain details about murders and non-negligent  homicide in the United States, including information about the  geographic location and, when known, the relationship between the  victim and the perpetrator. Data were weighted to adjust for missing  homicide records in the SHR data (as compared to data from the FBI's  Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest series) and for missing  victim-offender relationship information. Data for arrests for violent  crime (rape, robbery, and assault) and drug- and alcohol-related  offenses were obtained from the agency-level FBI Report A Arrest  File. Population, population density, and race (and racial  segregation) data from the decennial United States Census for 1980,  1990, and 2000 were interpolated for intercensal years. United States  Census population data were used to calculate all population-based  rates: per 100,000 age 15 and over for intimate partner homicide, and  per 100,000 for all ages for all other homicide types. Data on  hospitals, educational attainment (persons 25 or older with 12 or more  years of education), unemployment, and per capita income were obtained  from the 2002 Area Resource File (ARF). The total number of  proprietors (farm and non-farm) in the United States by state and  county for each year were provided by the Regional Economic Profiles  data. The project's population and proximity indicator collapsed the  10-point rural-urban continuum codes (Beale codes) into four  categories: metropolitan, nonmetropolitan populations adjacent to a  metropolitan area, nonmetropolitan populations not adjacent to a  metropolitan area, and rural. The Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers  Crosswalk file was used to match the FBI data with the other public  use data by matching FBI agency codes with Federal Information  Processing Standard (FIPS) codes. Data were aggregated in five-year  averages to account for potential instabilities in the annual rates, particularly for the low-population counties."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data include homicide rates for 1980 through 1999  for intimate partner homicide, family homicide, all other homicide,  and all homicide.

Additionally, residential overcrowding was  measured by persons per housing unit, isolation by persons per square  mile, traditionalist views of women and family by the percentage of  adults with 12 or more years of education, lack of access to health  care by the number of hospitals per 100,000 population, and substance  abuse by arrests per 100,000 population for alcohol-related offenses  (drunk driving, liquor law offenses, and public drunkenness), and  arrests per 100,000 population for drug-related offenses.
