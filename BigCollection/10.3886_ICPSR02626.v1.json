The project assessed the role that gangs play in the lives  of youth whose living conditions are otherwise comparable. In order to  study the criminal behavior of gangs, investigators sought to  interview 50 gang members and 50 non-gang, at-risk youth at two sites  in Colorado and one site in Florida. A large portion of the interview  questions asked in both the gang member interview and the at-risk  youth interview were parallel. The following variables appear in both  the gang member and at-risk youth files (Parts 1 and 2 respectively)  created for this data collection: gang popularity variables  (respondents' perceptions of the positive and negative attributes of a  gang, and why gangs endure over time), drug involvement variables  (whether respondents or fellow members/friends sold various types of  drugs, why selling drugs increases a person's \"juice\", the drug source  organization, and where they traveled to get the drugs), criminal  history variables (the reasons why respondents believed they were able  to get away with crimes, their first arrest age, and their most  serious arrest charge), personal activity variables (whether  respondents or fellow members/friends participated in dances, sporting  events, fighting, drug use or selling, shoplifting, assaulting people,  or burglarizing homes), variables concerning the future (whether  respondents would join a gang again/join a gang today, why some gangs  survive and others don't, and how respondents see their future), and  demographic variables (respondents' age, sex, race, city,  neighborhood, school, school status, type of work, marital status, and  relationship with parent(s)). In addition, Part 1, the Gang Member  Data, contains gang status variables (gang symbols, gang nickname,  gang turf, and how members define a gang) and gang membership  variables (roles of the respondents within the gang, why members join  a gang, what the most important gang rule is, and what happens to  those who refuse the gang). Part 2, At-Risk Youth Data, contains  additiona\nl variables on gang contact (the names of gangs who had  approached the respondents, methods used to try to get the youths to  join, how the youths refused the gang, and what happened as a result  of refusing) and prevention (how at-risk youth would advise a young  person to react if approached by a gang, and what the youths felt was the best way to prepare children to deal with gangs)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Many communities throughout the nation have  attempted to address the emergence of gangs and their related criminal  behavior since the mid-1980s. This study was designed to assist these  communities and the government in formulating and implementing  policies and programs designed to prevent and control the criminal  behavior of gangs. The study sought to measure the criminal behavior  of gangs, including their involvement in drug use and drug trafficking  activities, and to compare gang behavior with that of youth who were  at risk, but who had not yet become active in gangs. The project  assessed the role that gangs play in the lives of youth whose living  conditions are otherwise comparable. The study focused on three  critical research questions: (1) What is the nature and extent of  criminal behavior committed by youth gangs? (2) What is the nature and  extent of criminal behavior committed by non-gang, at-risk youth? and  (3) What is the marginal contribution of gang involvement to criminal behavior, comparing gang youth with at-risk youth?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In order to study the criminal behavior of gangs,  investigators sought to interview 50 gang members and 50 non-gang,  at-risk youth in three sites. Interviewers at each site were selected  and trained by the principal investigator using an interview  instrument developed for this study. All respondents were paid for  their time with either movie coupons or McDonald's coupons. In  addition to the coupons, those individuals who had been ordered to  complete community service time were given the opportunity to request  that the researchers contact the court to ask that the interview be  counted toward the youth's community service requirement. Interview  scheduling was established so that the safety of all human subjects  was protected -- for example, members of rival gangs were never  scheduled for sequential interviews. Each of the 285 interviews  completed during the study required approximately one and one-half to  two hours to complete. Interviews were audiotaped for later  transcription, and all responses were subsequently coded for computerized data analyses."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A large portion of the interview questions asked in  both the gang member interview and the at-risk youth interview were  parallel.
