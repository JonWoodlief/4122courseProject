At the five-year follow-up visit, an additional sample of 15 families was added to the 44 in the longitudinal sample. Comparison data were collected from 32 Chinese-American families at this time as well.<br /><br />  Participants were studied seven times over a six year period, beginning before the fourth month of pregnancy, and concluding when the children were five years old. Wives, husbands, and eventually children completed a battery of measures that included self-report scales and semistructured interviews. Other data included clinical assessments, unstructured observations, semistructured observations, and videotapes of parent-child interactions at 2 and 5 years old. Videotapes of some of the children at age 7 were made by a student as part of another project. The variables assessed for adults included psychological, marital, sociocultural, physiological, and parental ones. There are also child measures starting at birth. A total of 40-60 measures were administered to all participants throughout the six years.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study: Original record paper data, numeric file data from the various rating and self-report scales, audiotapes of interviews, and some videotapes of parent-child interactions at 2, 5, and 7. The Murray Archive also holds original record paper data from the Chinese-American comparison sample.
