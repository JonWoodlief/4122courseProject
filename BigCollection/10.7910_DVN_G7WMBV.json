The project identifies four types of variables that facilitate policy innovation: a favorable political context, a favorable political opportunity structure, substantial resources available to supporters, and a willingness by supporters to frame their proposals to \"fit\" with the political opportunity structure and to moderate and compromise. The project identifies a \"moderation dilemma\" for advocates: if they fight for the policy they truly want they may fail, but moderation and compromise to assure passage may result in a significant\nly weakened policy.<br /><br />Logistic regression analysis was used to model the context in which state policies were enacted. Liberal, non-Southern states with \"moralistic\" political cultures were most likely to have passed family and medical leave. Four state case studies (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Tennessee, and North Carolina) were chosen to maximize variation in these contextual variables and to allow for a focus on structural and group resources. The state case studies were compared wit\nh a case study of family and medical leave at the national level.\n<br /><br />Key structural resources included a unified leadership, the presence of political goals that could be linked with the bill, and the lack of distracting issues. Elite, professional advocates with strong ties to the political establishment and experience in passing moderate legislation were more likely to form successful coalitions to support family and medical leave. These \"insider\" coalitions enjoyed more credibility with decision makers and were also more likely to moderate and acce\npt compromise than were coalitions of \"outsiders,\" who found it difficult to accept the principle of incremental change. The definition of moderation varied between the Northern, Southern, and national case studies.\n<br /><br />The fact that the family and medical leave policies that succeeded on both the state and national levels generally cover barely half the population and are unpaid illustrates the moderation dilemma. It remains to be seen if this modest beginning will eventually lead to more significant policy development, or if family and medical leave will remain largely symbolic."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Political Science"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Policy Making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family Leave"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medical Leave"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard University, Department of Government"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Public health"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family.
