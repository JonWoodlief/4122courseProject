Specifically, the study assesses the impact of a  \"practice interview\" about an event on the completeness and accuracy  of later reports about a second, unrelated event. Three interview  conditions were employed, and each condition consisted of both a  practice interview and a target interview. The three conditions were  RS, RC, and CC, where \"R\" represents a practice session with  rapport-building only, \"S\" represents a target interview that  contained all components of the standard interview procedure, and  \"C\" represents either a practice or target interview that contained  all components of the cognitive interview procedure. In  rapport-building sessions, interviewers talked about school  activities, family life, and favorite games with the child. In  standard and cognitive interview sessions, the rapport-building  sessions were followed by a request from the interviewer for the child  to verbalize a narrative account of \"what happened\" during an event  that had been previously staged by the experimenter. This narrative  account was then followed by the interviewer's request for additional  information about the event. Cognitive interviews also included  several additional questions that were hypothesized to improve recall  performance. The number of correct items recalled and the number of  incorrect items generated were used to compare the performance of children in the three interview conditions."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"courts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"court cases"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"testimony"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
