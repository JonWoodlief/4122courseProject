In the first wave (1969-1970), women who had at least one teenage child and lived in a small to medium-sized town, took part in interviews. Topics covered in the extensive first wave interview included basic family and demographic information, employment history, attitudes toward child rearing and day care, satisfaction, and aspirations.<br /><br />  One year later, a follow-up questionna\nire was completed by approximately 88% of the original sample. This self-administered questionnaire included items on religion, job search activities, health, support systems, and welfare history. A short, thi\nrd wave questionnaire was mailed to a subsample of respondents in 1971 and 1972. Items examined included husband's background, self-assessment as a homemaker, husband's work, and role conflicts.
