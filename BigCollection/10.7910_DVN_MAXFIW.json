The study also seeks to determine the relationship between climate for\r\ninnovation, organizational learning and work motivation in employees of small and medium sized IT\r\ncompanies. A non-probability purposive sampling technique was employed to select a sample of 200\r\nemployees, aged between 25-35 years, out of whom 100 (50 men and 50 women) worked in small sized IT\r\ncompanies and 100 (50 men and 50 women) worked in medium sized IT companies. The DLOQ (Marsick\r\n& Watkins, 2003) was administered to measure organizational learning. The climate for innovation\r\nquestionnaire (Scott & Bruce, 1994) was administered to measure the support for innovation in\r\norganizations. The WEIMS (Tremblay et al, 2009) was administered to measure work motivation.\r\nSignificant differences were found between the employees of small and medium companies and also\r\nbetween men and women employees with respect to the dimensions of climate for innovation,\r\norganisational learning and work motivation (p<0.05). Climate for innovation, organizational learning\r\nand work motivation were found to be significantly correlated in small and medium sized companies\r\n(p<0.05). The study emphasizes the crucial importance of non-monetary factors in a company that may\r\nlead to higher job satisfaction, learning, productivity and increased performance and growth."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-08-10"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Arts and Humanities","Business and Management"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"corporate employees"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"innovative climate"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"organizational learning"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"small and medium sized companies"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work motivation"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This article is originally published and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21013/jmss.v4.n1.p23"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Journals, IRA"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-08-10"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This article is originally published and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21013/jmss.v4.n1.p23","label":"IRAJMSS23.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":86773,"dataFile":{"id":2865537,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MAXFIW/ARIF2D","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MAXFIW/ARIF2D","filename":"IRAJMSS23.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":173967,"description":"This article is originally published and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21013/jmss.v4.n1.p23","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:156a600a645-57c8ca7cc481","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"198a9895dcbe816fedc47d63ccfec185","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"198a9895dcbe816fedc47d63ccfec185"}}}]}}}
