They were also queried on whether they thought China's growing economy was a major threat to the economy of the United States, whether respondents thought the United States would have gained ground to China's economy by the end of 2011, whether Americans were more interested in what the country could do for them rather what they could do for their country, and whether most members of Congress were more interested in serving the people they represent or in serving special interest groups. Respondents were queried on their impression of the war in Afghanistan, whether the United States was doing the right thing by fighting the war in Afghanistan, and when United States troops should come home from Afghanistan. They were also asked whether they approved of embryonic stem cell research, whether federal spending on medical research using embryonic stem cells should be increased, decreased, or stay the same, whether illegal immigration was a serious problem, and their views on abortion. They were queried on their favorite holiday song, if they planned to make any New Year's resolutions for 2011, whether they thought they would gain or lose weight over the course of the next year, their preferred Sunday activity for 2011, whether they checked the labels of items to see if they are buying American made products, their frequency in checking e-mail, what they thought of their penmanship, and how frequently they wrote by hand. They were asked whether they had or planned to travel for vacation in the upcoming winter season, whether they were planning to travel some place warm or cold, and whether they thought the weather patterns had been normal or unusual the past few years. Respondents were also asked for their opinion of WikiLeaks, their interest in the 2011 royal wedding, whether they are paid what they think they are worth, whether they have Attention Deficient Disorder, and whether they were proud of their life so far.
