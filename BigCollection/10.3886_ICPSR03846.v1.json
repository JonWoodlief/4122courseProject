Respondents were asked to give   their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the   presidency, the economy, foreign affairs, health care, and the   welfare system. Views were sought on the most important issues facing   the country, the condition of the national economy, whether President   Clinton was seeking the right or wrong changes for the country, if he   made more mistakes than usual for a president, whether he was a   strong and decisive leader, and whether he understood the problems of   people like the respondent. Respondents were polled on whether they   approved or disapproved of the way President Clinton was handling the   situations in North Korea, Haiti, Rwanda, and Bosnia, whether the   United States' interests were at stake in these countries, and   whether the United States should take action to restore democracy in   Haiti and prevent North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons.   Questions involving health care asked whether President Clinton's   plan was better than the current system, whether President Clinton or   Congress should handle health care reform, whether the system should   be fixed or changed completely and in what ways, and whether it was   more important to guarantee health care for all Americans or to hold   down the cost for working people. Opinions were solicited on Congress   and how well it was doing its job, how much it accomplished in the   past 18 months, what prevented it from accomplishing more, and   whether the Democratic or Republican party could be better trusted to   deal with the country's main problems. Respondents were asked whether   they would likely vote for President Clinton or a Republican nominee   in the 1996 presidential election, whether they would vote for a   Republican or Democratic candidate in the upcoming United States   House of Representatives election, whether they approved or   disapproved of the way their own representative was doing his or her   job, whether they would vote to re-elect him or her, whether they   felt more inclined to vote for incumbents or challengers for public   office, and whether they favored or opposed term limits for   representatives. A series of questions addressed whether respondents   considered themselves professional sports fans, whether they watched   or planned to watch the world cup soccer games, and whether they   thought they might ever be soccer fans. Other topics addressed   whether respondents had ever heard of the religious right, whether   they held favorable or unfavorable impressions of this group, whether   they considered themselves a member of the religious right, whether   homosexual relations should be legal or illegal, whether it was   morally wrong, whether homosexuality was a choice, and whether   homosexuals should have equal rights. Background variables include   age, sex, ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, education,   religion, religiosity, employment status, household income, social   class, subjective size of community, labor union membership,   political orientation, political party affiliation, whether the   respondent was registered to vote, whether he or she voted in the   1992 presidential election, and if so, for whom (Democrat Bill   Clint\non, Republican George H.W. Bush, or Independent candidate Ross  Perot)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional elections (US House)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign affairs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"homosexuality"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"professional sports"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"religious right"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
