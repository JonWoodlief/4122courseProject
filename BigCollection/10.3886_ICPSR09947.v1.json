The  collection provides information on arrestees who both tested positive  for drugs and were released on recognizance as well as those arrestees  who tested negative but were not released on recognizance. Drugs  tested for include heroin, cocaine, PCP, methadone, and  amphetamines. Arrestees who were released were randomly assigned to  one of three groups: weekly urine testing, referral to drug treatment,  or a control condition. The data offer information on the offender's  background, family and employment status, probation and parole status,  pending charges, and prior convictions. Other variables include date  of arrest, charge, initial release, decision, date of disposition,  type of final disposition, number of subsequent arrests before trial,  and number of bench warrants issued.
