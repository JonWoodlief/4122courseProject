For many states, the BRFSS is the only available source of timely, accurate data on health-related behaviors. BRFSS was established in 1984 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); currently data are collected monthly in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Guam. More than 350,000 adults are interviewed each year, making the BRFSS the largest telephone health survey in the world. States use BRFSS data to identify emerging health problems, establish and track health objectives, and develop and evaluate public health policies and programs. The BRFSS is a cross-sectional telephone survey conducted by state health departments with technical and methodological ass\nistance provided by CDC. States conduct monthly telephone surveillance using a standardized questionnaire to determine the distribution of risk behaviors and health practices among adults. Responses are forwarded to CDC, where the monthly data are aggregated for each state, returned with standard tabulations, and published at the year's end by each state. The BRFSS questionnaire was developed jointly by CDC's Behavioral Surveillance Branch (BSB) and the states. Data derived from the questionnaire provide health departments, public health officials, and policymakers with necessary behavioral information. When combined with mortality and morbidity statistics, these data enable public health officials to establish policies and priorities and to initiate and assess health promotion strategies. Demographic variables include race, age, sex, education level, marital status, employment status, and income level.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Asthma is one of the nation's most common and costly chronic conditions, affecting over 38 million Americans at some time in their lives.

Core component: The core is a standard set of questions asked by all states. It includes queries about current health-related perceptions, conditions, and behaviors (e.g., health status, health insurance, diabetes, tobacco use, disability, and HIV/AIDS risks), as well as demographic questions. Optional CDC modules: These are sets of questions on specific topics (e.g., cardiovascular disease, arthritis, women's health) that states elect to use on their questionnaires. In 2010, 26 optional modules were supported by CDC. The module questions are generally submitted by CDC programs and have been selected for inclusion in the editing and evaluation process by CDC. State-added questions: These are questions developed or acquired by participating states and added to their questionnaires. State-added questions are not edited or evaluated by CDC. Before the beginning of the calendar year, CDC provides states with the text of the core component and the optional modules that will be supported for the coming year. States select their optional modules and choose any state-added questions. Each state then constructs its questionnaire. The order of the questioning is always the same: the core component is asked first, optional modules are asked next, and state-added questions last. This ordering ensures comparability across states and follows CDC guidelines. Once the content (core, modules, and state-added questions) of the questionnaire is determined by a state, a hard-copy or electronic version of the instrument is constructed and sent to CDC. For states with Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) systems, this document is used for CATI programming and general reference.

Sections 1 and 2 ask questions in relation to the individual's health status as well as his or her health related quality of life. Section 3 asks questions concerned with the individual's access to health care. Sections 4 and 5 are concerned with the respondents sleeping and exercise practices. Sections 7 through 9 ask questions concerning the individual's cardiovascular health, par\nticularly hypertension, cholesterol awareness, and cardiovascular disease. Section 10 asks questions concerning the individual's asthma history. Section 11 asks questions regarding tobacco usage. Section 12 asks questions regarding demographic variables such as marital status, income, education, race, weight, height, and other similar variables. Section 13 asks a question regarding whether or not the respondent provided any health care to a friend or family member. Section 14 has questions pertaining to physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. Section 15 asks questions regarding alcohol consumption of the respondent. Section 16 asks questions regarding the individual's immunization history. Section 17 asks questions regarding the respondent's history of arthritis. Sections 18 and 19 ask questions about the respondent's intake of fruits and vegetables and the respondent's physical activity. Section 20 asks questions regarding the respondent's history of HIV/AIDS, given there is a history, and the respondent is below sixty-five years of age. Section 21 asks questions regarding the respondent's emotional support and life satisfaction, and section 22 asks questions about the respondent's history of cancer, given the respondent has one. The optional modules are selected modules the individual states administering the survey choose to have in the survey along with the core questions. However, not all of these modules make the survey, but they are evaluated by the CDC. These modules include questions regarding the following: pre-diabetes, diabetes, inadequate sleep, visual impairment and access to eye care, cardiovascular health, actions to control blood pressure, heart attack and stroke, women's health, prostate cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, cancer survivorship, adult asthma history, arthritis management, tetanus diphtheria in adults, adult
