Averaging the original regression model forecast with an equal-weights model forecast reduced error by 7%. (II) Combining forecasts from two Australian models and from eight U.S. models reduced error by 14% and 36%, respectively. (III) Using more knowledge by including all six unique variables from the Australian models and all 24 unique variables from the U.S. models in equal-weight “knowledge models” reduced error by 10% and 43%, respectively.\r\nOriginality: This paper provides the first test of applying guidelines for conservative forecasting to established election forecasting models. \r\nUsefulness: Election forecasters can substantially improve the accuracy of forecasts from econometric models by following simple guidelines for conservative forecasting. Decision-makers can make better decisions when they are provided with models that are more realistic and forecasts that are more accurate."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-10-11"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"combining forecasts, damping, econometrics, equalizing, knowledge models, regression analysis."}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Graefe, Andreas"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-10-11"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Accuracy gains from conservative forecasting.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":145303,"dataFile":{"id":3239389,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OI9IA3/CKGWZQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OI9IA3/CKGWZQ","filename":"Accuracy gains from conservative forecasting.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":2590,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166620ebc98-37662e8a82ce","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:+fj2eWcHTiDHEQto+hn35A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3f77ad14e97c99bfd3bee8940fb3ded2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3f77ad14e97c99bfd3bee8940fb3ded2"}}}]}}}
