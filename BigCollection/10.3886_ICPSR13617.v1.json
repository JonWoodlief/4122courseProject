In particular, the  project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,  adult crime, substance abuse, and violence.

The project collapsed 847 census tracts  in the city of Chicago into 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon  seven groupings of racial/ethnic composition and three levels of  socioeconomic status. The NCs were designed to be ecologically  meaningful. They were composed of geographically contiguous census  tracts and geographic boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's  neighborhoods were considered in the definition of the NCs. Each NC  was comprised of approximately 8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal  Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a  stratified probability sample of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80  NCs were sampled from the 21 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by  three socioeconomic levels) with the goal of representing the 21 cells  as equally as possible to eliminate the confounding between  racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic status. Once the 80 NCs were  chosen, then block groups were selected at random within each of the  sample neighborhoods. A complete listing of dwelling units was  collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant women, children, and  young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18  years) were identified through in-person screening of approximately  40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The screening response rate  was 80 percent. Children within six months of the birthday that  qualified them for the sample were selected for inclusion in the  Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347 participants were  identified through the screening. Of the eligible study participants,  6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data collection, and 5,338 were  interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection.</p>\n\n<p>Data collection for  Wave 2 began in 1997 and ended in 2000. It included a letter sent to  study participants notifying them that they would be contacted to  schedule an interview. This letter explained the study,  reimbursements, and offered a monthly drawing prize of $1,000 for  those participants who kept their first scheduled appointment. A toll  free number was also included in the letter, so participants could  call and schedule their own interviews or ask questions.</p>\n\n<p>For  all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the child  were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to spend  the most time taking care of the child. Separate research assistants  administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child  interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face  interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the  personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated  telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in  Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 2 who lived  outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants  were able to travel for interviews. A total of 221 telephone  interviews were conducted during Wave 2, representing 3.55 percent of  the sample.</p>\n\n<p>Proxy interviews were conducted with study  participants who were emancipated minors (under 18 but married or  living independently). The study participants answered questions from  the primary caregiver's interview on the primary caregiver's  behalf. In Wave 2, four primary caregivers and two study participants  were interviewed in jail. Study participants in foster care could not  be interviewed. The Department of Children and Family Services did not  allow interviews of the foster parent or the child. Permission was  granted for a brief period in Wave 1, therefore there are some  children in the sample who could not be followed up in Waves 2 and  3.\nSome children were not in foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in  foster care by Wave 2 or 3. They were also not followed up. Lastly,  some participants were interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as  they were in foster care during Wave 2.</p>\n\n<p>Some participants in  Wave 1 spoke a language other than English, Spanish, or Polish. In  Wave 2, an abbreviated version of the primary caregiver's protocol was  administered, and the research assistant arranged for someone in the  household to translate on the spot. In Wave 2, the complete protocol  was translated into Spanish, and a subset of the primary caregiver's  interview was translated into Polish.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the age and  wave of data collection, participants were paid between $5 and $20 per  interview. Other incentives, such as free passes to museums, the  aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes were also included.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For  example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking  traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,  delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and  self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also  interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,  parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental  health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Exposure to Violence (Subject)</strong></p>\n\n<p>For Wave 1, a  subject self-report version of the Exposure to Violence measure was  used.
