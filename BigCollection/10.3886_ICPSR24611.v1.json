The Home Mortgage Di\nsclosure Act (HMDA) data were collected from 8,886 lending institutions and cover approximately 34.1 million home purchase and home improvement loans and refinancings, including loan originations, loan purchases, and applications that were denied, incomplete or withdrawn. The Private Mortgage Insurance Companies (PMIC) data refer to applications for mortgage insurance to insure home purchase mortgages and to insure mortgages to refinance existing obligations. Part 1, HMDA Transmittal Sheet (TS), and Part 4, PMIC Transmittal Sheet (TS), include information submitted by reporting institutions with the Loan Application Register (LAR), such as the reporting institution's name, address, and Tax ID. Part 2, HMDA Reporter Panel, and Part 5, PMIC Reporter Panel, contain information on all institutions that reported data in 2006. Part 3, HMDA MSA Offices, and Part 6, PMIC MSA Offices, contain information on all metropolitan statistical areas in the data. Parts 7 through 789 contain HMDA and PMIC Loan Application Register (LAR) files at the national level, at the agency level, and by MSA/MD. With some exceptions, for each transaction the institution reported data about the loan (or application), such as the type and amount of the loan made (or applied for) and, in limited circumstances, its price, the disposition of the application, such as whether it was denied or resulted in an origination of a loan, the property to which the loan relates, such as its type (single-family versus multi-family), and location (including the census tract), the sale of the loan, if it was sold, and the applicant’s and co-applicant's ethnicity, race, sex, and income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"loans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mortgage companies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mortgages"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"refinancing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.

Additionally, not all mortgage lenders are HMDA reporters. For example, a lender does not have to report HMDA data unless it has an office in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). As a result, reporting of home loans made in some rural areas may be relatively low.
