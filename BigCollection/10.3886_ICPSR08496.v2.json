Citizens' attitudes toward the police were also  examined. Baseline data were collected to determine residents'  perceptions of crime, victimization experiences, crime-avoidance  behavior, and level of satisfaction with the quality of life in their  neighborhoods (Parts 1 and 3). Follow-up surveys were conducted to  evaluate the effectiveness of experimental police programs designed to  reduce the fear of crime within the communities. These results are  presented in Parts 2 and 4. In Part 5, questions similar to those in  the baseline survey were posed to two groups of victims who reported  crimes to the police. One group had received a follow-up call to  provide the victim with information, assistance, and reassurance that  someone cared, and the other was a control group of victims that had  not received a follow-up call. Part 6 contains data from a newsletter  experiment conducted by the police departments after the baseline data  were gathered, in one area each of Houston and Newark. Two versions of  an anti-crime newsletter were mailed to respondents to the baseline  survey and also to nonrespondents living in the area. These groups  were then interviewed, along with control groups of baseline  respondents and nonrespondents who might have seen the newsletter but  were not selected for the mailing. Demographic data collected include age, sex, race, education and employment."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police activity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victimization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"New Jersey-Newark"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Texas-Houston"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
