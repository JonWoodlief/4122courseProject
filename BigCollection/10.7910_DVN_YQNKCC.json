IHI proposed a new methodology, the Global Trigger Tool ( IHI GTT), to detect and monitor adverse events and provide information to implement improvement. In 2015, the Sicilian Health System (SHS) adopted IHI GTT to assess the number, types, and severity levels of adverse events in 2015. To perform this reliably and uniformly, a centralized process was developed. The GTT was implemented in 44 of the 73 Sicilian public hospitals. 18,008 clinical records were examined. In this paper, we present the standardized application of the GTT and the preliminary results of 14,706 reviews of clinical records in medicine, surgery, obstetric and ICU wards, evaluated from June
