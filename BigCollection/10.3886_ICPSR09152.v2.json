They also were asked how they would vote if the election were held the day of the survey, if their minds were made up, and how strongly they favored the candidates they chose. Other information elicited included responden\nts' choice if they were only voting for president or for vice-president, if they were better off now than they were eight years ago, if they approved of the way Reagan was handling his job as president, previous voting behavior, who they thought would win the election, and whether they thought so because of opinions expressed in the media, by polls, by people they know and trust, or because of what the candidates themselves said.
