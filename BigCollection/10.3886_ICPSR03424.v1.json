The goals of the TRP were to increase attendance and to get children   safely to and from school. While habitual truancy, also referred to   as chronic absenteeism, was legally defined under the Juvenile Offender Act   of the State of Tennessee as five or more aggregate, unexcused absences in   the course of a school year, the TRP operationally defined students at risk   of truancy as those who had three unexcused absences in a school year. The   intent of TRP was to intervene before the student was adjudicated habitually   truant, so once a student had a third unexcused absence, the child was placed   on the TRP caseload. TRP staff would then intervene with a variety of   services, including home visits, community advisory boards, a suspension   school, and a summer program. The evaluation study was designed to test the following   hypotheses: (1) students who participated in TRP would increase their   attendance rates, and (2) students who participated in TRP and other community   services that were part of the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program   network would increase their attendance rates at higher rates than students   who participated in TRP alone. The targeted population for this study   consisted of child and youth residents from five of the six public housing communities   that participated in TRP.

The juvenile court probation officers who conducted the truancy   reduction programs submitted a list of TRP participants and their addresses   to study staff. Study staff then collected the TRP entry dates from the   probation officers and collected the attendance data from the juvenile   court to add to the metro school system's attendance data. Each   student's attendance record for each school year of the study was printed   from this system. Study staff then key entered the data into the study   database.
