A related hypothesis was that victims from states with strong  legal protection would have more favorable experiences and greater  satisfaction with the system than those from states where legal  protection is weak. The Victim Survey (Parts 1, 4-7) collected  information on when and where the crime occurred, characteristics of  the perpetrators, use of force, police response, victim services, type  of information given to the victim by the criminal justice system, the  victim's level of participation in the criminal justice system, how  the case ended, sentencing and restitution, the victim's satisfaction  with the criminal justice system, and the effects of the crime on the  victim. Demographic variables in the file include age, race, sex,  education, employment, and income. In addition to the victim survey,  criminal justice and victim assistance professionals at the state and  local levels were surveyed because these professionals affect crime  victims' ability to recover from and cope with the aftermath of the  offense and the stress of participation in the criminal justice  system. The Survey of State Officials (Parts 2 and 8) collected data  on officials' opinions of the criminal justice system, level of  funding for the agency, types of victims' rights provided by the  state, how victims' rights provisions had changed the criminal justice  system, advantages and disadvantages of such legislation, and  recommendations for future legislation.

By 1998, all 50 states had passed some form of a  statutory crime victims' bill of rights, and 29 states had amended  their constitutions to include rights for crime victims. Despite this  widespread adoption of legal protection for the constitutional rights  and civil liberties of victims, the implementation of such protection  and its impact on victims had not been widely studied, nor had much  research been directed at how this legislation influenced victim  perceptions of the criminal j\nustice system. To address these issues,  the largest survey of crime victims to date was conducted to determine  whether state constitutional amendments and other legal measures  designed to protect crime victims' rights had been effective. This  study sought to answer the following questions: (1) Do victims' rights  statutes work? (2) Do these statutes foster fairness and respect for  the rights and interests of crime victims? This study was designed to  test the hypothesis that the strength of legal protection for victims'  rights has a measurable impact on how victims are treated by the  criminal justice system and on their perceptions of the system. A  related hypothesis was that victims from states with strong legal  protection would have more favorable experiences and greater  satisfaction with the system than those from states where legal  protection is weak. In addition to the victim survey, criminal justice  and victim assistance professionals at the state and local levels were  surveyed because these professionals affect crime victims' ability to  recover from and cope with the aftermath of the offense and the stress  of participation in the criminal justice system. It was hypothesized  that criminal justice and victim services professionals would have  greater awareness of victims' rights issues in states with stronger  protections. This survey was also used to explore the reasons why  victims' rights laws might or might not produce satisfaction among victims."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The first step in the study was identifying two  states that were weak in protecting victims' rights and two that were  strong. From the four selected states, adult crime victims' names and  locational information were obtained from departments of corrections  and victims' compensation agencies. All crime victims selected had  reported crimes to the police, most had substantial exposure to the  criminal justice system through the progress of their case, and most  had fairly recent experiences with the criminal justice  system. Targeted for inclusion were victims of physical assault,  robbery, and sexual assault, as well as surviving family members of  homicide victims. Researchers attempted interviews with all such crime  victims who acknowledged their victimization. Phone interviews were  conducted with 1,308 of these crime victims. In addition to the  victim survey, state and local criminal justice officials and victims'  advocates were surveyed in these same four states to determine the  extent to which they were aware of the legal rights of victims, their  views of how victims' rights are ensured, and their thoughts about  what further steps may be necessary to strengthen the protection of  victims' rights. State officials included agency directors,  legislators, victim coalition directors, and other government  officials. Local officials included judges, prosecutors, parole and  probation officers, victim assistance coordinators, victim-witness  staff, defense attorneys, and police and sheriffs. About half of the local officials surveyed were judges."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Victim Survey (Parts 1, 4-7) collected  information on when and where the crime occurred, characteristics of  the perpetrators, use of force, police response, victim services, type  of information given to the victim by the criminal justice system, the  victim's level of participation in the criminal justice system, how  the case ended, sentencing and restitution, the victim's satisfaction  with the criminal justice system, and the effects of the crime on the  victim.
