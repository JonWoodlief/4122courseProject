Additional questions focused on the respondents'  knowledge of and opinions on the European Union (EU), including how  well-informed they felt about the EU, what sources of information  about the EU they used, and whether their country had benefited from  being an EU member. The surveys also questioned respondents on the  common European currency, whether certain policy decisions (e.g.,  defense, environmental protection, currency, health and social  welfare, education, etc.) should be made at the national or EU level,  what criteria were important for deciding whether a new country should  join the EU, how the enlargement of the EU would affect the current  members countries, the EU Common Agricultural Policy, the Treaty of  Amsterdam, the Basque Country, their thoughts about the 21st century,  and their feelings toward people of other nationalities, races, and  religions. A set of questions also asked about respondents' attitudes  toward the European Parliament, how this organization defended their  interests, and whether they planned to vote in the next elections to  the Parliament scheduled in June of 1999. A major focus of the surveys  was issues surrounding vacations and holiday travel. Respondents were  asked whether they had taken a trip in 1997 and, if not, the reason  they did not travel, whether they had ever been on a holiday and, if  so, when they went on their first holiday and for what duration, what  subsequent vacations they took, which countries and locales they  visited,\nwho accompanied them, and how they traveled to their  destinations. Other questions focused on where respondents stayed  during their holiday, what criteria they used to select a holiday  destination, how much they would spend in the current year for their  holiday, what type of payment (e.g., checks, credit card) they used,  what types of local products they purchased, what kinds of places they  visited, and what kinds of events they attended. They were asked who  arranged their holiday, how they obtained information and how they  rated tourist information in general, if they sought out tourist  information before or while on vacation, and how satisfied they were  if they had already taken a vacation during the year. They also  indicated whether they planned to travel in the following year and, if  so, specified their intended destination. Demographic characteristics  collected include nationality, left-right political self-placement,  gender, age, occupation, marital status, age at completion of  education, number of people in household, family income, size of  locality, region, and whether a telephone was available in the  household. Selected standard Eurobarometer constructed variables and  indices are also included.
