We first describe the basic features of the NI winding technique, including lumped circuit and distributed network models. Next, we present results of a stand-alone NI magnet composed of REBCO double-pancake coils, showing that the magnet is indeed self-protecting. In the last part of this paper, we discuss the technical issues, often called “NI behaviors”, objectionable demerits that still remain, particularly in nested-coil NI magnets. These include charging delay, non-linear magnet constant in time-varying operation, unbalanced forces that can overstrain the conductor. We conclude the paper with our conviction, and optimism, that the NI winding technique is viable for HTS magnets, high-field and large electric power devices."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"active control"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"charging delay"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"No-insulation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"overstrain"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self-protect"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/18ja/18ja016/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-18-16</a><br /><br />This work was supported by KBSI grant (D37611) to S.-G.
