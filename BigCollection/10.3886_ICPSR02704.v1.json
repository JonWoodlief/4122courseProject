Two specific programs were evaluated  in four New York City middle schools. The more limited program used  Project S.T.O.P.(Students Teaching Options for Peace), a conflict  resolution and peer mediation training program. The full  multi-faceted program combined Project S.T.O.P. with Safe Harbor, a  program that provided victimization counseling and taught violence  prevention. The effects of this combined program, offered in three of  the middle schools, were compared to those of just the Project  S.T.O.P. program alone in one middle school. To study the program  models, researchers used a quasi-experimental pre-post design, with  nonequivalent comparison groups. Questionnaires were given to students  to assess the impact of the two programs. Students were asked about  their knowledge and use of prevention programs in their schools. Data  were also collected on students' history of victimization, such as  whether they were ever attacked at school, stolen from, mugged, or  threatened with a weapon. Students were also asked about their  attitudes toward verbal abuse, victims of violence, and conditions  when revenge is acceptable, and their exposure to violence, including  whether they knew anyone who was sexually abused, beaten, or attacked  because of race, gender, or sexual orientation. Additional questions  covered students' use of aggressive behaviors, such as whether they  had threatened someone with a weapon or had beaten, slapped, hit, or  kicked someone. Data were also gathered on the accessibility of  alcohol, various drugs, weapons, and stolen property. Demographic  variables include students' school grade, class, sex, number of brothers and sisters, and household composition."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Since the 1980s, violence prevention programs  have focused on teaching youths alternative conflict resolution skills  through curricula and dispute mediation. Most of these prevention  programs have addressed violence in limited contexts. For example,  some focused on conflict resolution, some on assisting victims of  violence, and some on violence in dating relationships. Because the  effects of experiences with violence are likely to be cumulative and  to reinforce each other, it is postulated that the effectiveness of  violence prevention is maximized through a broad-based, multifaceted  program. This research project sought to evaluate the impact of such a  program by comparing it to a program that had a more limited  focus. Two specific programs were evaluated in four New York City  middle schools. The multifaceted program was comprised of Project  S.T.O.P.(Students Teaching Options for Peace), a conflict resolution  and peer mediation training program, in conjunction with Safe Harbor,  a victimization counseling and violence prevention program. The  comparison program consisted solely of the Project S.T.O.P.  program. The purpose of the comparison was to assess changes in: (1)  students' knowledge and skill in how to resolve conflict nonviolently,  (2) students' attitudes about violence and its acceptability, (3)  students' behavior with respect to fighting and other aggressive  behavior,\n(4) students' use of services for personal victimization  experiences, and (5) the amount of disciplinary action and weapons possession in the school."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Researchers assessed the impact of the two  violence prevention programs using a quasi-experimental pre-post  design, with nonequivalent comparison groups. Three of the schools  (Schools B, C, and D) had a multifaceted program that offered Project  S.T.O.P. in conjunction with the Safe Harbor program, while one school  (School A) provided only the Project S.T.O.P. program. In all schools,  Project S.T.O.P. had been in place for approximately one year before  the onset of the evaluation. Data were collected through  administration of questionnaires to students. The process began in  February 1993, the same month that the Safe Harbor program began in  three of the schools. Due to limited evaluation resources and the  eventual discontinuation of the Safe Harbor program in one school  (School D) during the second year of evaluation, data collection  efforts were more limited in two of the schools (Schools C and  D). Data were collected from students in grades 6 to 8 at four  different time periods: (1) before the Safe Harbor program began  (February 1993) in all schools, (2) at the end of the first program  year (June 1993) in all schools, (3) at the beginning of the second  program year (November 1993) for new 7th graders in Schools A, B, and  C, and (4) at the end of the second program year (June 1994) in Schools A, B, and C."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Students were asked about their knowledge and use  of prevention programs in their schools.
