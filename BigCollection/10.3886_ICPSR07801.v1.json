There were three distinct types of respondents: (1) active  skiers, i.e., individuals who had skied since November 1977, (2)  inactive skiers, i.e., individuals who had skied in the past but not  since November 1977, and (3) potential skiers, i.e., individuals who  had never skied, but might try in the next few years. Part 1 contains  data for 601 active skiers, e.g., preferences for, skill level, and  number of years experience in downhill and cross-country skiing, the  locations (both within and outside the United States) where  respondents had skied, number of days skied in the past season, type  and duration of ski vacations, and total days skiing over the past  five years. Other data include projected increase or decrease in  participation level, attitude toward cost of ski-related items, and  whether cost had kept respondents from skiing. Part 2 contains more  data gathered from the same group of active skiers, including  preferences for skiing alone or with others, adequacy of ski  facilities, and images of downhill skiing. This file also supplies  respondent background information, e.g., age, sex, marital status,  employment of spouse, number of children, occupation, number of times  moved in last five years, place of residence, income, and  education. Part 3 contains data for 676 inactive skiers, with the same  variables as Part 1, plus data for the number of years since last  skied, reasons for not skiing since then, and when resumption of  skiing would occur. This file also records inactive skiers'  preferences for skiing alone or with others, adequacy of ski  facilities, and images of downhill skiing. Part 4 contains background  data gathered from the 676 inactive skiers. Part 5 provides data on  1,003 potential skiers, e.g., interest in skiing, readership about and  television viewing of skiing, members of the family who had ever  skied, reasons for not taking up skiing, whether cost was a  contributing factor for not skiing, adequacy of ski facilities,  attitude toward the cost of ski-related items, images of downhill  skiing, and ownership of various recreational equipment. Part 6  contains additional data for the same group of potential skiers, e.g.,  recreational activities respondents would choose to participate in and  states where respondents would choose to ski. The same types of  background information collected in Parts 2 and 4 are contained in this file as well."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leisure"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"outdoor recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public image"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation equipment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation expenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"skiing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sports participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.F.
