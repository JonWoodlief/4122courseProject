Cross-sectional surveys of clients of sex workers were conducted at hotspots across the four states in May 2007 (n=1741). The sampling frame for the May 2007 survey was based on an existing list of hotspots compiled by PSI; it was updated on an annual basis. Stratified two-stage cluster sampling surveys were conducted with hotspots defined as the primary sampling units (PSUs). States were regarded as strata, although Maharashtra was divided into two strata: Mumbai (due to its size) and the rest of the state. Baseline (April 2006) and endline (November 2008) surveys were conducted for programme evaluation purposes, while the three intermediate rounds provided programme monitoring data. The target sample sizes for baseline and endline were 2400 individuals per round (480 per strata); the target sample size for monitoring was 1800 per round (360 per strata). The samples also allowed for comparisons across time within strata (calculating a 15% change in main behavioural indicator over time); significance level (alpha) was set at 0.05 and power (beta) at 80%."}]}},"files":[{"description":"Tools for ABTS-3_2007 (By PSI)","label":"ABTS-3-2007 - STI_Tools.rar","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131349,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2450319,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"ABTS-3-2007 - STI_Tools.rar","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":3148005,"description":"Tools for ABTS-3_2007 (By PSI)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168567","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fbca49c1b18d3208c5c34bee68697ea8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fbca49c1b18d3208c5c34bee68697ea8"}}},{"description":"Zipped ABTS/OTS Merged Data, India, By PSI","label":"PSI OTS_ABTS merged data set 2006-2008.tab","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131349,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2434879,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"PSI OTS_ABTS merged data set 2006-2008.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":25941485,"description":"Zipped ABTS/OTS Merged Data, India, By PSI","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:106698","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:WFwwNUBUbRLho5fU2jABBw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ac1fb366cff5ed3841dadfed26b25fb2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ac1fb366cff5ed3841dadfed26b25fb2"}}}]}}}
