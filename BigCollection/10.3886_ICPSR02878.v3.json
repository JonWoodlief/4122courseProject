Data were gathered using a  survey instrument developed by National Institute of Justice staff,  reviewed by practitioners and researchers with crime mapping  knowledge, and approved by the Office of Management and Budget. The  survey was mailed in March 1997 to a sample of law enforcement  agencies in the United States. Surveys were accepted until May 1,  1998. Questions asked of all respondents included type of agency,  population of community, number of personnel, types of crimes for  which the agency kept incident-based records, types of crime analyses  conducted, and whether the agency performed computerized crime  mapping. Those agencies that reported using computerized crime mapping  were asked which staff conducted the mapping, types of training their  staff received in mapping, types of software and computers used,  whether the agency used a global positioning system, types of data  geocoded and mapped, types of spatial analyses performed and how  often, use of hot spot analyses, how mapping results were used, how  maps were maintained, whether the department kept an archive of  geocoded data, what external data sources were used, whether the  agency collaborated with other departments, what types of Department  of Justice training would benefit the agency, what problems the agency  had encountered in implementing mapping, and which external sources  had funded crime mapping at the agency. Departments that reported no  use of computerized crime mapping were asked why that was the case,  whether they used electronic crime data, what types of software they  used, and what types of Department of Justice training would benefit their agencies."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Computerized crime mapping technology enables law  enforcement agencies to analyze and correlate data sources to create a  detailed snapshot of crime incidents and related factors within a  community or other geographic area. In particular, it enables agencies  to target resources for more effective crime control strategies,  identify likely suspects, evaluate the results of interventions, and  more efficiently and effectively allocate officers to geographic areas  in which they are needed. While interest in this technology within the  law enforcement community a\nppears to be growing, until recently little  data existed on how widely computerized crime mapping was used, in  what capacity, and what influenced an agency's implementation of a  geographic information system (GIS). As a first step in understanding  law enforcement agencies' use and knowledge of crime mapping, the  Crime Mapping Research Center of the National Institute of Justice  conducted a nationwide crime mapping survey to determine which  agencies were using GIS, how they were using it, and, among agencies that were not using GIS, the reasons for that choice."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The survey instrument was developed by National  Institute of Justice staff, reviewed by practitioners and researchers  with crime mapping knowledge, and cleared by the Office of Management  and Budget.

All other  surveys were sent to the attention of the agency chief. The survey  was mailed in March 1997 to a sample of law enforcement agencies in  the United States. Agencies that did not respond to the first mailing  were sent a second survey. Surveys were accepted until May 1, 1998.
