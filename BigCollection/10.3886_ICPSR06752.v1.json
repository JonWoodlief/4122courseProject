In  addition, respondents were queried on a few standard Eurobarometer  measures, such as whether they attempted to persuade others close to  them to share their views on subjects they held strong opinions about  and whether they discussed political matters, and how they viewed the  need for societal change. Respondents provided information about their  personal health care, including their general state of health, number  of hospital stays, types of examinations received, and whether they  had been on a diet, as well as their perceptions of heart  disease. Respondents also answered questions about the health care  system in their countries and indicated how well health care was run,  to whom the government should provide health care, whether the  government should spend more money on health care, and if th\ney were  willing to pay more taxes or have the government spend less on other  things in order to contribute to health care. A number of questions  concentrated on sickness benefits allocation. Questions concerning  public security included how safe respondents felt walking alone near  their homes, how often they had witnessed drug-related problems near  their homes, if their homes had been broken into, and whether they had  been attacked or seriously threatened. Respondents were also asked  about their awareness of consumer protection legislation adopted or  introduced by the European Union (EU) in areas such as import, postal  services, toy safety, pricing, packaging, advertising, contracts,  holiday conditions, and court proceedings.  Opinions were also  elicited on the police, type of contact respondents had with the  police, and the cooperation between the police forces from EU member  states. In addition, respondents answered a series of questions  concerning their views on employment, unemployment, and gender  equality. These data are reported in a separate collection,  EUROBAROMETER 44.3OVR: EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND GENDER EQUALITY,  FEBRUARY-APRIL 1996 (ICPSR 2443). Demographic and other background  information provided includes respondent's age, gender, nationality,  marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age  at completion of education, household income, size of household, car ownership, region of residence, and subjective size of community."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer

If desired, these cases can be excluded from  analysis.

Inconsistencies have been found such that the  number of nights spent in the hospital (Q119B and Q119C) is smaller  than the number of different times spent overnight in a hospital  (Q119A). Also, respondents who answered \"don't know\" to Q119A (code 99  in V54 and code 10 in V55) should not have been asked Q119B and  Q119C.
