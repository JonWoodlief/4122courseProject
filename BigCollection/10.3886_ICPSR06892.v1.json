Data from these surveys were used to construct variables for the panel cases that are comparable to those available directly for the cross-section cases. In addition, this data collection includes panel data not available in the previously released 1983 and 1989 cross-sectional SCF studies. Data from the 1986 SCF (ICPSR 9753) were treated only as a source of limited information for the construction of the cross-sectional variables and are otherwise not included. This dataset is not intended to reproduce the cross-section results from the 1983 or 1989 SCF. Cross-sectional items from 1983 and 1989 in this data collection include the composition of family balance sheets, terms of loans, relationships with financial institutions, pension status of the survey respondent and the spouse or partner of the respondent, economic assets and liabilities of families, attitudes of consumers toward credit use, and their reactions to consumer credit regulations. Demographic variables include age, gender, marital status, housing, and financial independence. Panel survey issues focused on changes in marital status, household composition, and work history, including number of employers in the past 36 months, reason for leaving job, number of months of full-time and part-time work in the past 36 months, and pension plan status for the respondent and the respondent's spouse. Gender, marital status, and age data were also collected for new household members."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer protection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"credit"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"debt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial assets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial institutions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household budgets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"loans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR IX.

The sample includes all cases  that were interviewed in 1989 that had either cross-section and panel  representation or only panel representation. A separate panel  questionnaire was used, which\nassumed the availability of information  reported earlier on marital and work history. An interviewer was sent  to this subsample of 1983 addresses. If the person at that address was  a respondent to the 1983 SCF or the spouse or partner of that person,  an attempt was made to obtain an interview. If the person living there  was a new person, an interview was attempted, and for a subsample the  original respondent was also pursued. The new person had only  cross-section representation and the 1983 respondent had only panel  representation. In general, the sample followed both 1983 respondents  and the spouses or partners of 1983 respondents in cases where the  original couple had dissolved. A small supplemental sample was added  to the panel/cross-section to compensate for new construction. There  are 1,479 original observations in the panel dataset, but due to the  multiple imputations stored as separate replicates, this collection has 4,437 observations."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Survey of Consumer Finances Panel Survey, 1983-1989","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35340,"dataFile":{"id":2611636,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Survey of Consumer Finances Panel Survey, 1983-1989","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
