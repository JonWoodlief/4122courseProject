The network’s study encompasses the momentous years of women’s movements from the emergence of autonomous protests in Europe and North America for the liberation of women in the 1960s and 1970s through the successful integration of movement activists into conventional politics in the 1990s and 2000s.  The unit of analysis in the study and the dataset is a policy debate which takes place in a political/government arena and ends with an official decision or non-decision. Information in the dataset comes from the two phases of the project—qualitative and quantitative.\n<br /><br />  The dataset suite includes a PDF codebook/users guide and two data files—one of the numerically based data set in SPSS and a second file with text appendices of supplemental descriptive information for 22 variables in PDF.  The dataset was initially presented to interested scholars August 29, 2007 at a short course at the American Political Science Meetings in Chicago.  In Fall 2011, the final RNGS dataset will become part of the ICPSR data archive.  It is also available to downloa\nd from the RNGS website -- http:/libarts.wsu.edu/polisci/rngs. The website also has documents that provide detail on all aspects of the project.\n<br /><br />"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job training, abortion, political representation, prostitution, hot issue, women's movement"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://libarts.wsu.edu/polisci/rngs/publications.html\">Link to publications</a>  related to this study<br /><br />  <a href=\"http://libarts.wsu.edu/polisci/rngs/capstone.html\">Link to a capstone book</a> that examines cross-issue patterns and trends<br /><br />  <a href=\"http://libarts.wsu.edu/polisci/rngs/comparative.html\"> Link to a follow-up study</a> \"Comparative State Feminism II\" that examines state feminism in the contemporary context"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"the Research Network on Gender Politics and the State"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Washington State University"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"RNGS"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://libarts.wsu.edu/polisci/rngs/"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://libarts.wsu.edu/polisci/rngs/images/rngs-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IQSS Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/images/iqss-logo-background.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-04-14"},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["The capstone book, <i>The Politics of State Feminism: Innovation in Comparative Research</i>, published in 2010 with Temple University Press<br /><br />"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"RNGS Appendix Text Files 2011.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":50714,"categories":["3.
