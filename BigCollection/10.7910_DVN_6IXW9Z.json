The androgen receptor (AR) is essential in both, though its function in androgen-independent cancers is poorly understood. We have defined the direct AR-dependent target genes in both androgen-dependent and -independent cancer cells by generating AR-dependent gene expression profiles and AR cistromes. In contrast to what is found in androgen-dependent cells, AR selectively upregulates M-phase cell-cycle genes in androgen-independent cells, including UBE2C, a gene that inactivates the M-phase checkpoint. We find that epigenetic marks at the UBE2C enhancer, notably histone H3K4 methylation and FoxA1 transcription factor binding, are present in androgen-independent cells and direct AR-enhancer binding and UBE2C activation. Thus, the role of AR in androgen-independent cancer cells is not to direct the androgen-dependent gene expression program without androgen, but rather to execute a distinct program resulting in androgen-independent growth."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-10-18"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Cell09_245.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54342,"dataFile":{"id":1581697,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Cell09_245.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1845394,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:61871","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"90fa52f86944f9da88c9bae66e8a0304","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"90fa52f86944f9da88c9bae66e8a0304"}}}]}}}
