To this end, separate surveys of the general public (Part 1) and physicians (Part 2) were conducted. The Survey of the Public collected data on demographics, health status, health insurance coverage, perceived quality of medical care, sources of medical information, and attitudes toward and experience with DTCAs and health information on the Internet. Respondents who had seen a DTCA or health information on the Internet in the past 12 months, perceived it as personally relevant, and discussed it with their physician were asked about the last time they had done this, e.g., whether they scheduled the doctor visit specifically because they wanted to discuss information they got from the Internet, whether, during or after the visit, the doctor diagnosed them with the disease or medical condition that a DTCA related to, and whether or not their physician ordered a test, changed their medication or treatment, or referred them to a specialist when they talked about a DCTA during the visit. Similarly, the Survey of Physicians explored the most recent occasion when physicians talked to a patient about information the patient found on the Internet or obtained from a DTCA. Physicians expressed their views on the impact of this information on health outcomes, health service utilization, and the physician-patient relationship. Additional topics covered by the Survey of Physicians included the role physicians played in their patients' health care decisions and role they would like to play in these decisions, physicians' use of the Internet for purposes related to the practice of medicine, and physicians' practice profiles, income, age, race, and Hispanic origin. The data from the Survey of Physicians include variables from the American Medical Association's (AMA) master files such as sex, type of medical specialty, and year of graduation from medical school."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"advertising"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Internet"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"patients"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physician patient relationship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physician practice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physicians"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prescription drugs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA I.
