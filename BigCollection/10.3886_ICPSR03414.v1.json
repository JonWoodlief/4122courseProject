The Developmental Disabilities Institute  at Wayne State University, in collaboration with the United Cerebral  Palsy Association in Michigan, conducted a one-year study to  investigate the prevalence and correlates of, and service system  capacity related to, domestic abuse among women with physical  disabilities in Michigan. The study aimed to address the following  research questions: (1) What is the prevalence of domestic violence  among a sample of women with physical disabilities? (2) What potential  factors for domestic violence exist among women with physical  disabilities? and (3) What is the capacity of existing support  programs (e.g., safe houses, shelters, and service agencies) to assist  women with physical disabilities? The population for this study was  women over the age of 18 who had physical disabilities. Consistent  with the work of other researchers, physical disabilities in this  study were defined as those disabilities that result in functional  impairment, such as cerebral palsy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida,  amputation, rheumatic conditions, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord  injury, traumatic brain injury, visual impairment, hearing impairment,  and stroke. A sample of 177 women was recruited through several  mechanisms. To address the question of domestic abuse prevalence, the  women participating in the study were first asked to complete a brief  questionnaire addressing demographic characteristics and their  experience with domestic violence (Part 1, Screening Interview  Data). Fifty-six percent (100) of the 177 women interviewed indicated  a positive history of abuse at their initial screening. In order to  address the second research question about the correlates of abuse,  this subsample of 100 women was invited and encouraged to participate  in the second phase of the research, which involved a more extensive  interview (Part 2, Abuse Interview Data). The interview used was based  on a protocol developed by Nosek (1995) that addressed demographic  characteristics, social networks, and abuse history. Variables in  Parts 1 and 2 include type of dis\nability, type of personal assistance  needed, and whether the respondent was ever physically, emotionally,  or sexually abused. Part 2 also contains variables on sources of monthly  income, who perpetrated the abuse, the abuser's gender, how long the  victim knew the abuser, whether the victim sought assistance from a  domestic violence program or shelter, and a description of the worst  incident of physical abuse. Demographic variables in Parts 1 and 2 include ethnicity, age, employment status, and marital status."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In the past few years it has become alarmingly  clear that women with disabilities are at an extremely high risk for  emotional, sexual, and physical assault.
