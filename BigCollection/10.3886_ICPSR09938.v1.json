General questions   probed the respondents' level of satisfaction with the way they spent   their weekends, whether they had too little or too much to do and   wished they had done more or less, whether they were enjoying   themselves more on weekends now than five years ago, and whether there\nwere enough things to do on weekends in the Washington area.   Specifically, respondents were asked to rate the weekend previous to   the interview on a scale of 1 to 10, list what they did on that   particular weekend, state the number of hours spent watching television   over the weekend, and indicate the day of the week by which their   weekend plans were set. Those surveyed were also asked about their   source of information for things happening on the weekend, whether they   had cut back on the amount of money spent on weekend activities over   the past year or two, and whether there were certain parts of the   greater Washington area they had stopped going to for fear of crime.   Other subjects addressed included the new stadium for the Baltimore   Orioles, the respondent's preference for the location of a new stadium   for the Washington Redskins, credit card debt, and personal spending   patterns. Background information on respondents includes political   alignment, education, marital status, number of children living at   home, employment status, unemployment among household members, Hispanic  origin, household income, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leisure"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"lifestyle"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation expenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"time utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"travel"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.F.
