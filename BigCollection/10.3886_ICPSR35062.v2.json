The first period, 2001-2006, utilized two surveys. Individuals who completed one survey but not the other had a value of -4 assigned by ICPSR for all variables pertaining to the survey not taken. In the second data collection period, 2009-2013, the survey consisted of a single document so no such designation assignment of missing cases exists.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The Principal Investigator deposited a data file for each of the two data collection periods. Due to the substantial overlap in the variables ICPSR merged the two files into one file. The file order and variable names are based off of the 2001-2006 data collection period. The file order was adjusted by ICPSR to account for sub-questions new in the 2009-2013 data collection period. Within the main question these variables were placed after the original variables. Variables unique to 2009-2013 were named by the Principal Investigator beginning with the letter \"V\" for the variable name. Questions not asked on one of the surveys have a missing value assignment of -5 by ICPSR designating those cases.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>A few questions used the same wording, and were named the same, but had different response categories during the two data collection periods. In 2001-2006 these questions had a Yes/No response format. In 2009-2013 the questions asked for the number of times (categorized) something occurred. For these variables ICPSR renamed the variables from 2009-2013 to include the letter \"R\" at the end of the variable name. The word \"(times)\" was also added to the variable label to signify the difference. Within the dataset the two variables follow one another.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>In the 2001-2006 administration, questions about grade, age, and gender were asked on both the A-9 and PPSC2 questionnaires. If data was missing from one of the surveys the data from the other survey was utilized. If there was a discrepancy between the two surveys, the Principal Investigator used the responses f\nrom the A-9 survey.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>Variables Q38L, Q39K, and Q40K refer to \"Adrenochromes\" which is a fake drug. These questions were used to identify patterns of exaggeration by the researchers.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The Principal Investigator created the variable ULOCATION to allow analysis by school. It was created by merging the survey year with the order schools were scanned in for that year. So the first school scanned in 2006 would have a value for ULOCATION of 2006001, and the second school scanned would have a value of 2006002. The order schools were scanned in changed from year to year.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>Some schools were re-surveyed over the course of a four-year cycle. In order to limit statistical dependence within the data, when schools were repeated, grades which contained students from previously surveyed students were dropped from the dataset. For example, if a school containing grades 9 through 12 was re-surveyed three years later, students in the 12th grade from the second administration of surveys would be dropped, as they would have been in the 9th grade from the first survey administration.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The Principal Investigator did not include any computed scale scores into the dataset. However, the Principal Investigator provided a document describing the computation of the scales they created and used. ICPSR included this in the PDF codebook. Researchers are free to re-create these scales for their own use. Also no variables were reverse coded in the dataset. The Principal Investigator provides the warning that researchers should verify that the variable in use is coded in the direction the researcher intends.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>ICPSR created a crosswalk and included it in the PDF questionnaire. The crosswalk contains the complete list of variables, in the order they appear in the data file, along with its' variable label, and the question number from the survey.</p>; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), rda Data file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"R01DA003371"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-07-22"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Randomized, de-identified community codes"]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individual"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Students in grades 7 through 12 attending schools on or near American Indian reservations with at least 20 percent American Indian students."]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Each year of the funding period a survey was completed by a sample of students in the 7th to 12th grades.
