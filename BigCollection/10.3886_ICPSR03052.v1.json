It also  investigated the role of other potential risk factors, including  family background, sexual behavior, alcohol problems, and a woman's  own aggressive behavior. The investigators sought to answer the  following questions: (1) Are victims of child sexual abuse at  increased risk of adolescent or adult sexual victimization as compared  to nonvictims? (2) Are victims of child sexual abuse at increased risk  of physically violent nonsexual victimization as compared to  nonvictims? (3) How is the risk of sexual revictimization and physical  victimization among abuse survivors affected by their engaging in  violent behavior, such as physical fighting, engaging in heavy  drinking, and practicing risky sexual behavior, such as having  multiple sexual partners? (4) Were women who reported drinking  problems and physical fighting in Wave 2 at increased risk of domestic  violence victimization at Wave 3, compared to the other child abuse  victims in the study? This study consisted of a secondary analysis of  selected variables collected during two waves of a three-wave  prospective study of the consequences of child abuse and sexual  assault for adult, adolescent, and child victims (McCahill, Meyer, and  Fischman, 1979). During the first wave of the study, data were  gathered on 206 girls ranging in age from 10 months to 12 years who  were victims of reported cases of sexual abuse and who were examined  at a municipal hospital in 1973-1975. In 1990 and 1991, follow-up  interviews (Wave 2) were conducted with 136 of the original 206 girls,  then aged 18 to 31. During this wave, a comparison group of girls  treated at a hospital for reasons other than child sexual abu\nse was  matched to the 206 victims on the basis of race, age, and date of  hospital visit, for purposes of analysis of their official criminal  records. The criminal records data are not included in this data  collection. Also, none of the women in the comparison group were  interviewed during Wave 2. In 1996 and 1997, another wave of follow-up  interviews (Wave 3) was conducted. Using the same criteria as in Wave  2, a new matched comparison group was identified, resulting in an  additional 85 girls in the sample. Of the 174 women interviewed during  Wave 3, 80 were known victims of child sexual abuse who also had been  interviewed during Wave 2. The data in Part 2 (Wave 3 Women Also  Interviewed at Wave 2) are a subset of Part 1 (All Wave 3  Interviews). Part 1 variables supply information on self-reported  family history of substance abuse and criminal activity, parental care  and neglect, and family violence when the respondent was a  child. Topics focusing on respondents' current (adult) experiences  include violence in relationships, injuries as a result of domestic  violence, use of a weapon during domestic violence, sexual history,  sexual victimization, and parental attachment. Variables in Part 2  cover parental affection and support received by the respondent when  she was a teenager, history of fighting, physical abuse by a partner,  dating and sexual history, alcohol abuse, and sexual  victimization. Demographic variables (found in Part 1 only) include age, marital status, race, and education."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study addressed the question of whether  women who were sexually abused as children were at increased risk of  either sexual abuse or of domestic violence victimization later in  life.
