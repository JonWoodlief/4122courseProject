Accordingly, the Urban Institute and Florida State University multidisciplinary research team employed a multimethod approach to evaluate the Agricultural Crime, Technology, Information, and Operations Network (ACTION) project, located along the sourthern coast and central valley of California and supported by the Bureau of Justice Assistance. The goal of the research was to provide policymakers, practitioners, program developers, and funders with empirically-based information about whether ACTION works. The objectives included assessing the effectiveness of the ACTION project in reducing agricultural crime, examining the costs and benefits and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) issues related to evaluating the program, and identifying how programs like ACTION can be effectively adopted by other jurisdictions."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>Two paper-and-pencil, self-administered surveys -- one in fall 2004 and the second in fall 2005 -- were sent to samples of farmers in the nine Agricultural Crime, Technology, Information, and Operations Network (ACTION) counties in California.  The researchers identified farms using lists provided by Agricultural Commissioners in each county. Specifically, an ACTION staff member contacted each county’s Agricultural Commissioner office and obtained their most accurate pesticide permit holder lists in June and July of 2004. This list was used fo\nr the 2005 survey as well.  Before sampling for the second wave of survey mailings in 2005, the researchers confirmed with Agricultural Commissioners’ offices that their lists of pesticide permit holders do not change more than 10 percent from year to year as permits are valid for three years at a time.</p>\n\n<p>The lists provided relatively complete enumerations of farm operations that use pesticides -- which typically includes all but the smallest operations and livestock operations that do not grow their own feed -- because these farms must register with the Agricultural Commissioners. Conversations with Commissioners’ offices and representatives from the National Agriculture Statistics Service indicated that the sampling approach was likely to capture the majority of pesticide users, particularly medium and large operations. Nonetheless, any results using these data may not fully generalize to all farms, such as those focused primarily on livestock or that do not use pesticides, or to farms beyond the study region. The survey instruments, developed with the assistance of experts who consulted on the project and with farmers, and drawing on instruments used in previous studies (e.g., Bean and Lawrence 1978; Farmer and Voth 1989; Cleland 1990), were administered in the fall (2004 and 2005, respectively) and asked farmers about experiences with agricultural crime victimization during the 12 months prior to the survey. It also asked questions about characteristics of their farm operations and the activities that they take to prevent agricultural crime.</p>\n\n<p>Advance notice of the study was given to farmers through the use of postcards, then surveys were sent to farmers in three waves at one-month intervals, with the second and third waves targeting nonrespondents. Cover letters were included, as was a letter of support from the California Farm Bureau Federation and a self-addressed, stamped return envelope. For the first survey, concern about the relatively low response rate prompted the researchers to reconsider incentive options for the follow-up mailing. The research team decided to provide a one or two dollar incentive in each survey mailed in the third follow-up. Because prior research provided no basis for determining whether two dollars would garner more responses than would one dollar, half the final follow-up received two dollar incentives and the other half received one dollar incentives. Subsequently, the researchers found little difference in the response rates of farmers who received one dollar versus two dollars. However, the incentives did appear to boost the response rate. Given the improvement gained from using the incentives, and the lack of difference in using one dollar versus two dollars, the second-year survey included one dollar incentives in all three waves of mailings. In addition, a raffle incentive was introduced in the final follow-up; respondents who returned the survey within three weeks were eligible to win $100.
