However, many astrophysical plasmas are nearly collisionless so that the MHD approximation is not applicable to turbulence at small scales. In this paper, we propose the extension of the theory of reconnection-mediated turbulence to plasmas which are so weakly collisional that the reconnection occurring in the turbulent eddies is caused by electron inertia rather than by resistivity. We \ffind that the transition scale to reconnection-mediated turbulence depends on the plasma beta and on the assumptions of the plasma turbulence model. However, in all cases analyzed, the energy spectra in the reconnection-mediated interval range from $E(\\k_\\perp) dk_\\perp \\propto k_\\perp^{-8/3} dk_\\perp$ to  $E(k_\\perp) dk_\\perp \\propto  k_\\perp^{-3} dk_\\perp$."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"kinetics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"magnetic fields"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"magnetic reconnection"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"magnetohydrodynamics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"turbulence"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/17ja/17ja038/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-17-38</a><br /><br />This work was supported by the NSF-DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering, Award No. DE-SC0016214, and by NSF Career Award No. 1654168."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"17ja038_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":145729,"dataFile":{"id":3246789,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/JTKKXJ/6ZTQID","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JTKKXJ/6ZTQID","filename":"17ja038_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":136068,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166ac99e587-4581a4d03374","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0d97da1a9fa67801ed9126c28e5b5e3a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0d97da1a9fa67801ed9126c28e5b5e3a"}}}]}}}
