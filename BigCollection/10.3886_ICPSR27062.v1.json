The larger purpose of the Midwest Study of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth (Midwest Study) was to gather information about services provided to selected youth served in participating states and the adult self-sufficiency outcomes achieved by the youth.  The research team considered the importance of experiences within the child welfare system on criminal behavior during the transition to adulthood. In addition, they examined whether social bonds predict criminal behavior and the risk for criminal justice involvement among former foster youth. The following research questions were addressed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are offending patterns during the early transition to adulthood (ages 17-22) among youth formerly in out-of-home care different from those of the general population?</li>\n<li>Do experiences in out-of-home care, including number of placements, placement type, age at entry, and receipt of independent living services predict later criminal behavior or criminal justice involvement during the transition to adulthood among youth aging out of the child welfare system? Is the relationship between out-of-home care experiences and crime moderated by race?</li>\n<li>Above and beyond prior experiences with maltreatment and within the child welfare system, do the bonds to parents or caregivers, education, or employment that foster youth have as they approach the transition to adulthood predict later criminal behavior or criminal justice involvement?</li>\n</ol>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The study collected data from two sources: (1) survey data from the Midw\nest Study of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth (Midwest Study), and (2) official arrest data.</p>\n\n<p>The Midwest Study was a longitudinal panel study that was part of a collaborative effort of the state public child welfare agencies in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, and the University of Washington. The participating states funded and/or operated the full range of services supported by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (e.g., life skills training, mentoring, tutoring, employment services, transitional housing), but these services varied considerably in availability between and within the states.  In addition, the policy regimes differed across the three states in ways that affected the supports available to youth who aged out of care. For example, at the time of this study, youth in Illinois were legally permitted to remain in care until age 21, while youth in Iowa and Wisconsin remained in care until approximately age 18.</p>\n\n<p>The Midwest Study survey data were collected directly from the youth in the sample every two years over three waves, between May 2002 and January 2007.  A total of 732 respondents participated in at least one of the in-person interviews over the three waves.  The interviews were approximately 90 minutes long and were made up almost entirely of fixed response questions. A portion of the survey was administered using Audio Computer Aided Self Interviewing (ACASI). Study participants listened to a recording of questions about criminal behavior through headphones and entered their responses into a computer.</p>\n\n<p>During the first wave of interviews, conducted between May 2002 and March 2003, 732 interviews were completed.  Youth were between the ages of 17 and 18 when they were first interviewed. The second interview took place in March through December 2004, between respondents' 19th and 20th birthdays. A total of 603 youth completed the Wave 2 survey.  The third wave of interviews, conducted between March 2006 and January 2007, took place as soon as possible after respondents' 21st birthday.
