The survey was conducted for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) over a four-month period, from June through September 2005. T\nhis collection contains 2 sets of travel data: (1) a survey of 1,220 permanent households within the Tahoe basin region, and (2) a subset survey of 125 seasonal households within the same area. The permanent resident dataset contains information about 2,732 household members, 2,471 vehicles, and details regarding 11,048 trips made during a 24-hour period; the seasonal resident subset features 726 trip observations and information about 229 household members and 185 vehicles. The survey relied on the willingness of study area residents to (1) provide demographic information about the household, its members, and its vehicles, and (2) document all travel for each household member, regardless of age, over an assigned 24-hour period. During the recruitment phase, respondents were asked to provide detailed household information, including permanent or seasonal resident status, number of household occupants, type of dwelling unit, number of vehicles available to household members, as well as the year, body type, and fuel type of each vehicle. Survey participants received mailed travel logs to aid in  documenting travel information for the 24-hour assessment period. Respondents were instructed to record their mode of transportation, trip purpose, number of passengers, departure and arrival times, activities at each trip destination, ride fare, and parking cost. Demographic information for this study includes age, gender, income, education, and employment status."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The primary objective of the survey was to document travel behavior data characteristics of regional households in order to update transportation models and plans for the Tahoe basin."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For Dataset 1 (Permanent Resident Households), the recruitment and retrieval phases were conducted via telephone interview.
