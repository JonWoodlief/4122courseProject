This suggests that some conflict situations are more open to mediation than others. This study develops and tests a rational model of the conditions under which mediation will occur in international conflicts. The model explores the mediatorâ€™s intervention dilemma in terms of her perceived ability to transform the game that characterizes the present conflict into a game of (partial or complete) cooperation. The measure of conflict versatility is offered to denote the likelihood of, and difficulty involved in, such transformation. It is argued that the greater the versatility of the conflict, (1) the more likely are disputants to seek mediation, (2) the more likely are outside parties to mediate, and (3) the more intrusive the mediation strategies employed. Examining data on Militarized Interstate Disputes (MIDs) since World War II, the authors find substantive support for these hypotheses. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lesley Terris, Zeev Maoz. 2005. \"Rational Mediation: A Theory and A Test.\" Journal of Peace Research, 42(5): 563-583. <a href=\"http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/42/5/563\" target= \"_new\">article available here</a>"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Zeev Maoz"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://psfaculty.ucdavis.edu/zmaoz/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-05-07"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data file","label":"terrismaoz05.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51438,"categories":["1.
