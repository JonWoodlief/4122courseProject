The modules are intended to demonstrate the process of   examining evidence and reaching conclusions and to stimulate students   to independent, critical thinking and a deeper understanding of   substantive content. They enable students with no previous training to   make use of the computer to analyze data on political behavior or to   see the results of policy decisions by use of a simulation model. The  SETUPS: AMERICAN POLITICS modules were developed by a group of political   scientists with experience in teaching introductory American government   courses who were brought together in a workshop supported by a grant   from the National Science Foundation in the summer of 1974. The   American Political Science Association administered the grant, and the   Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research was host   to the workshop and provided data for most of the SETUPS. The modules   were tested and evaluated during the 1974-1975 academic year by   students and faculty in 155 classes at 69 universities and colleges.   Appropriate revisions were made based upon this experience. This   collection comprises 15 separate modules: (1) Political Socialization  Across the Generations, (2) Political Participation, (3) Voting Behavior,  The 1980 Election, (4) Elections and the Mass Media, (5) The Supreme  Court in American Politics, Court Decisions, (6) The Supreme Court in   American Politics, Police Interrogations, (7) The Dynamics of Political   Budgeting, A Public Policy Simulation, State Expenditures, (8) The  Dynamics of Political Budgeting, A Public Policy Simulation, SIMSTATE  Simulation, (9) The Dynamics of Political Budgeting, A Public Policy   Simulation, SIMSTATE II Simulation, (10) Fear of Crime, (11) Presidential  Popularity in America, Presidential Popularity, (12) Presidential  Popularity in America, Advanced Analyses, (13) Campaign '80, The Public  and the Presidential Selection Process, (14) Voting Behavior, The 1976  Election, and (15) Policy Responsiveness and Fiscal Strain in 51   American Communities. Parts 8 and 9 are FORTRAN IV program SIMSTATE   sourcedecks intended to simulate the interaction of state policies.   Variables in the various modules provide information on respondents'   level of political involvement and knowledge of political issues,   general political attitudes and beliefs, news media exposure and usage,   voting behavior (Parts 1, 2, and 3), and sectional biases (15). Other   items provide information on respondents' views of government, politics,   Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter as presidents, best form of government,   government spending (Part 3), local police, the Supreme Court (Parts 4   and 15), the economy, and domestic and foreign affairs. Additional items   probed respondents' opinions of prayer in school, abortion, the Equal   Rights Amendment Law, nuclear energy, and the most important national   problem and the political party most suitable to handle it (Part 3). Also   included are items on votes of Supreme Court judges (Part 5), arrest of   criminal suspects and their treatment by law enforcement agencies (Part 6),  federal government expenditures and budgeting (Part 7), respondents'   feelings of safety at home, neighborhood crime rate, frequency of   various ki\nnds of criminal victimization, the personal characteristics of   the targets of those crimes (Part 10), respondents' opinions of and choice   of party presidential candidates nominees (Part 13), voter turnout for  city elections (15), urban unrest, and population growth rate.  Demographic items specify age, sex, race, marital status, education,   occupation, income, social class identification, religion, political  party affiliation, and union membership."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fear of crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"instructional materials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mass media"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Supreme Court"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR X.A.1.
