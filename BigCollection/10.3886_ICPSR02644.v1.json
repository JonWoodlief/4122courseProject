Their opinions were sought on whether it  was right for Congress to have publicly released the videotape, the  manner in which Clinton handled himself before the grand jury, and the  treatment of Clinton by the prosecutors. A series of items add\nressed  the questions posed to Clinton about the details of his sexual  activity with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Covered were  Clinton's refusal to discuss the details of that activity, whether the  prosecutors were right to ask such questions, Clinton's \"anger\"  about the repeated questions concerning the details, and the  respondents' interpretation of the phrase \"sexual relations.\" Those  queried were asked for their opinion on Clinton's interpretation of  the phrase \"sexual relations\" to mean only sexual intercourse and  not any other kind of sex. Respondents were asked to assess the  influence of the videotaped testimony on the American public, and to  comment on whether they believed Clinton's responses before the grand  jury. In addition, their opinions were sought on whether the president  should resign, remain in office, be impeached, or be censured, if it  were proven that he either lied under oath, encouraged Lewinsky to lie  under oath, or asked his aides or other people to cover up his affair  with Lewinsky. Background information on respondents includes sex and political party."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"grand juries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hearings"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lewinsky scandal"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"testimony"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
