These scales estimate the  probability that criminals will commit subsequent crimes quickly, that  individuals will commit crime frequently, that inmates who are  eligible for release on parole will commit subsequent crimes, and that  defendants awaiting trial will commit crimes while on pretrial arrest  or detention. The investigators used longitudinal data from five  existing independent studies to assess the validity of the four  predictive measures in question. The first data file was originally  collected by the Vera Institute of Justice in New York City and was  derived from an experimental evaluation of a jobs training program  called the Alternative Youth Employment Strategies Project implemented  in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Miami, Florida, and New York City, New  York. The second file contains data from a RAND Corporation study,  EFFECTS OF PRISON VERSUS PROBATION IN CALIFORNIA, 1980-1982 (ICPSR  8700), from offenders in Alameda and Los Angeles counties,  California. Parts 3 through 5 pertain to serious juvenile offenders  who were incarcerated during the 1960s and 1970s in three institutions  of the California Youth Authority. A portion of the original data for  these parts was taken from EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF THE CHRONIC  OFFENDER, [1978-1980: CALIFORNIA] (ICPSR 8226). All files present  demographic and socioeconomic variables such as birth information,  race and ethnicity, education background, work and military  experience, and criminal history, including involvement in criminal  activities, drug addiction, and incarceration episodes. From the  variables in each data file, standard variables across all data files  were constructed. Constructed variables included those on background  (such as drug use, arrest, conviction, employment, and education  history), which were used to construct the four predictive scales, and  follow-up variables concerning arrest and incarceration history. Scores on the four predictive scales were estimated."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminality prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"imprisonment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivists"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
