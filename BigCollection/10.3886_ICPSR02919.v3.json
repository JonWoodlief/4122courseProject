The focus of this data collection was the upcoming presidential election and New Hampshire primaries. Residents of New Hampshire were asked to\ngive their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency and New Hampshire governor Jeanne Shaheen and her handling of the state. Respondents were asked whether they intended to vote in the New Hampshire presidential primaries to be held February 1, 2000, and what their opinions were of Democratic candidates Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, and Republican candidates Texas governor George W. Bush, Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve Forbes, radio talk show host Alan Keyes, Family Research Council president Gary Bauer, and Utah senator Orrin Hatch. They were asked which candidate they intended to vote for and which candidate they thought would win, and whether they had ever considered voting in the opposing political party's primary. Respondents were further asked what they thought about the candidates, which candidate could be trusted to keep his word, to understand the complicated problems a president has to deal with, and to say what he believes, and whether they thought any candidate had made a decision as a direct result of a major campaign contribution. Additional questions related to the presidential campaigns probed the influence of television ads, which candidates' health-care plan respondents supported, whether respondents had been contacted by a campaign, and whether they had seen any of the candidates in person. Additional topics covered included abortion, the most important problems facing the country, and whether homosexuals should be permitted to serve in the military. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, marital status, education, religion, race, Hispanic origin, household income, computer and Internet access, and military service."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
