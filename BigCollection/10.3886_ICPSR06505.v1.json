The data   represent a sample of active new firms, started independently, that   cover all regions and industries of a typical state. Respondents   provided information concerning the income generated by their products   and their reasons for starting up a business in that particular area.   Also, respondents were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with   respect to taxes, availability of skilled labor and capital, and   accessibility to supplies and customers, and to indicate the importance   of these factors to their businesses. Additional questions called for   respondents to compare the current status of their firms to when the   firms first started up, in areas such as the amount of money they   received in loans, type of loans acquired, private and public stock   decisions, and the percent of the ownership retained by the founders.   The\nrespondents also addressed the focus of management, as well as how   they viewed their competitors' focus. In addition, survey participants   were given an opportunity to make their own comments, which also appear  in the data."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
