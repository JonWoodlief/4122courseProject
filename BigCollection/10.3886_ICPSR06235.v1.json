Offense rates in  housing developments were compared to rates in nearby areas of private  housing as well as to city-wide rates. In addition, the extent of law  enforcement activity in housing developments as represented by arrests  was considered and compared to arrest levels in other areas. This  process allowed both intra-city and inter-city comparisons to be  made. Variables cover study site, origin of data, year of event,  offense codes, and location of event.

This  study was conducted to provide an objective, quantitative description  of the extent and nature of crime in selected public housing  developments, an area where sound, empirical information was found to  be lacking. Three major questions guided the research: (1) How can  crime problems in housing developments be quantified using existing  records? (2) What are the rates of drug and other serious offenses in  conventional public housing developments, and how do these rates  compare to rates city-wide and in urban neighborhoods close to public  housing? (3) What is the extent of variation in offense rates among individual housing developments?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The investigators selected three major United  States cities and, within those cities, selected 29 housing  developments.

Demographic information for the housing developments and nearby  neighborhoods was developed from Census Bureau data and from information on  resident populations collected by housing authorities in compliance  with regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables cover study site, origin of data, year of  event, offense codes, and location of event.
