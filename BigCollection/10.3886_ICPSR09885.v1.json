Those surveyed were asked   how closely they had been following the presidential election, for   whom they would vote if their state held a Democratic primary or   caucus for president, the candidate towards whom they were leaning at   the time of the interview, whether they would vote for Bush or   Clinton for president if the election were held the day of the   interview, and whether they\nhad a favorable impression of Clinton.   Concerning Clinton's alleged extramarital affair with Gennifer   Flowers, respondents were asked whether they could vote for a   presidential candidate who had been involved in an extramarital   affair, whether they had heard about the allegations that Clinton had   had such an affair, whether they had seen Clinton's response to this   allegation on television, and whether they approved of Clinton's   response. Additionally, respondents were asked whether they agreed   with Clinton's assertion that the question of whether or not he had   an extramarital affair was between him and his wife, whether the   allegation of an affair made respondents more or less likely to vote   for Clinton, and if the question of whether or not Clinton had an   extramarital affair should be an issue in the presidential election.   Along the same lines, respondents were asked whether the news media   should continue to look into alleged extramarital affairs involving   Clinton or any other political candidate, whether Clinton should   withdraw from the race if it turned out that he did have an affair   with Flowers, whether his withdrawal should be based on having had   the affair or having denied it, and whether Clinton or Flowers had   told the truth. Background information on respondents includes  political alignment and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George H.W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Flowers, Gennifer"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"media coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
