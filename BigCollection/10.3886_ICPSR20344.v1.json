The researcher measured child outcomes  using several scales. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children  (WISC) (see PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS  (PHDCN): WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN-REVISED, WAVE 1,  1994-1997 [ICPSR 13604], and PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO  NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR  CHILDREN-REVISED, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 [ICPSR 13664]) and the child's  grades were used to measure the impact of exposure on the child's  cognitive functioning. Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)  (see PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN):  CHILD BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST, WAVE 1, 1994-1997 (ICPSR 13582) and PROJECT  ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): CHILD BEHAVIOR  CHECKLIST, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 [ICPSR 13611]) and questions about child  truancy, grade repetition, and drug use were used to assess the  behavioral impact of exposure to domestic violence. Anxiety was  measured by the anxiety sub-scale of the CBCL. The parent-child  relationship was measured by selected questions from the Home  Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scale (see  PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): HOME  OBSERVATION FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT, WAVE 1, 1994-1997  [ICPSR 13594]).</p>\n\n<p>For this study, the researcher defined domestic violence as the use  of physical force (for example, forcible restraint, slapping, shoving,  throwi\nng objects at, hitting, kicking, biting, burning, sexual  assault, or murder) or threat of the same against an intimate partner  (someone with whom the perpetrator was involved in a romantic or  sexual relationship for at least a month). Additionally, exposure to  domestic violence was defined as cohabitation with a primary caregiver  who was a perpetrator or victim of domestic violence. The definition of childhood included aged 0 to 18.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data include the variables that the researcher used  to study the effect of domestic violence exposure on not only  externalizing, internalizing, and total behavior problems, and  academic and cognitive ability, but also truancy, grade repetition,  and drug use.

One component of the PHDCN was the  Longitudinal Cohort Study, which was a series of coordinated  longitudinal studies that followed over 6,000 randomly selected  children, adolescents, and young adults, and their primary caregivers  over time to examine the changing circumstances of their lives, as  well as their personal characteristics, that might lead them toward or  away from a variety of antisocial behaviors. Numerous measures were  administered to respondents to gauge various aspects of human  development, including individual differences, as well as family,  peer, and school influences.
