An integral part of the design involved using a multi-method, multi-instrument approach that included both telephone and mail recruiting and allowed for mailback, phone and Internet responses. The sampling frame for this survey included all resident households within the study area. The survey administration was divided into three phases. The first was the pre-contact phase where pre-contact letters were sent to those selected in the sampling. Others were invited to participate through the Public Awareness Campaign. The second phase was the recruiting phase in which phone calls were placed to those on the random sample list who had phone listings, requested participation, collected Stage 1 (household information) data and assigned an initial travel day. Packets were mailed to those on the list without phone numbers, including printed survey forms, Internet access information and assigning a travel day. Materials were also provided to those recruited through the Public Awareness Campaign. The third phase was the retrieval phase where survey responses by phone, mail and Internet were tracked. Follow-up reminders were also provided to all who agreed to participate. An acceptable retrieval window was set to ensure that the data collected involved recollections of reasonably recent trip-making. For three two-day periods during November 2001 and February 2002, the Project Consultant team of TEI Engineers and Planners and the  Resource Systems Group conducted the household travel study in Volusia County, Florida with the purpose of reporting regional travel patterns and preferences to the Volusia County Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The first part of the survey questionnaire consisted of household information.

The mailing list of 6,300 names served as the sample for both the pilot study and the main survey. The pilot study included 630 names, and the balance of respondents was divided into two waves that constituted the respondent pool for the main survey. In order to ensure complete geographic coverage, the household sample was drawn from geographic sub-areas. Currently the Volusia County Metropolitan Planning Organization (VCMPO) has the county divided into six planning regions. These six planning regions are consistent with the Volusia County Comprehensive Plan planning regions. Once the survey was conducted, geographical stratification was possible because the households were geocoded by coordinate, allowing them to be \"tagged\" by any system of zones. Data from a similar study conducted in 1997, which served as a guide for this study, was provided by the VCMPO and were then used to ensure that an even distribution of surveys was being completed throughout the county. In total, two days of travel data were collected from 1,397 households resulting in a sample of 13,408 trips over 2,794 travel days. The project's scope of work specified that the error margin for trip generation rates should be +/- 5 percent with 95 percent confidence overall and +/- 10 percent for selected sub-areas. The target sample size of approximately 1,500 travel days was selected based on an assumption that the coefficient of variation for trip generation rates would be 1.0."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data has not been weighted.
