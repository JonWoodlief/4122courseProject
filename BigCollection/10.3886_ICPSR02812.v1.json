The Virginia Department  of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) administered this program. In this  capacity, the DCJS coordinated services, provided funds, and  participated in the development and dissemination of program  information and regulations. Given these responsibilities, DCJS'  Juvenile Services Section and the Criminal Justice Research Center  Evaluation Section agreed that an assessment of the CASA program was  needed. This study sought to evaluate the Virginia CASA program in  order to provide a better understanding of CASA activities and program  characteristics, and determine the impact of CASA intervention on its  client population. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected  from three sources: (1) administrative records gathered for a sample  of 78 cases (Part 1) involving 164 children (Part 2) taken from the  files of local juvenile courts, social service agencies, and CASA  programs, (2) telephone interviews administered to judges (Part 3)  presiding in all operational CASA jurisdictions across Virginia,  and (3) surveys distributed to CASA social workers (Part 4) and  volunteers (Part 5). Variables common to both Part 1 and Part 2  include the total number of abuse/neglect, custody, and Children in  Need of Supervision/Services (CHINS) petitions, date of first  petition, petition type, type of child abuse/neglect case, number and  date of prior removals from home, number of out-of-home, group home,  psychiatric, detention, and family/friend placements since the case  opened, whether there was any alcohol or drug abuse involved, and the  onset of these behaviors, whether there were any mental, intellectual,  academic, or behavioral limitations or problems, dates of first and  last court proceeding, date of finding (a social service agency  determination of whether abuse/neglect occurred), permanency date,  date of final placement, and the number of\nweeks a Court-Appointed  Special Advocate (CASA) was on the case. Variables unique to Part 1  include the age, sex, and date of birth for up to six victims and up  to three abusers, as well as whether any adult or child sibling of the  victim had been legally removed from the household, the relationship  of each abuser to each victim, and whether any of the victim's  siblings, mother, biological father, or caretaker had a criminal  history, mental illness, disabilities, or abused drugs or  alcohol. Other variables include the number of orders partially or  fully complied with or not complied with, the number of services  ordered for each victim and abuser, and whether there were any changes  in the family structure. For Part 3, judges were surveyed to determine  their perceptions regarding the role of CASAs, social workers, and  Guardians ad Litem (GALs) in abuse/neglect cases, the benefits of the  CASA program, how successful CASA case monitoring was, how useful CASA  information was, and the impact CASA programs had on the court  process. Judges also recommended changes or improvements they felt  were needed by the CASA program that served their court. The percent  of abuse/neglect, custody, and CHINS cases that each judge presided  over is also included. Demographic variables for Part 4 include the  age, sex, and race of each social worker. Other variables cover the  length of time worked with CASAs, the number of sexual abuse, neglect,  custody, and CHINS cases worked on, and the percent of time used to  appear in court, write reports, review records, interview the family  and child, and speak with CASAs and GALs. The respondents' perceptions  of the role of CASA, social workers, and GALs, how the CASA program  was beneficial or detrimental to a child, and suggestions for changes  or improvements to the CASA program complete the file. Variables for  Part 5 include the number of physical abuse, neglect, custody, and  CHINS cases worked on by a CASA volunteer. Additional variables  include the percent of time used to investigate and monitor the child,  family, foster family, the GALs, the social worker, and other CASA  staff, as well as the volunteer's relationship with social workers,  GALs, and judges. The age, sex, race, and educational background of each volunteer are also included."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In 1990, the Virginia General Assembly enacted  legislation that established the Court-Appointed Special Advocate  (CASA) Program. CASAs, who are appointed by a judge after a petition  is brought to court, are volunteers who serve as child advocates in  juvenile court proceedings, particularly in abuse and neglect  situations, and less frequently, in custody and Children in Need of  Supervision or Children in Need of Services (CHINS) cases. The  Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) administered  this program. In this capacity, the DCJS coordinated services,  provided funds, and participated in the development and dissemination  of program information and regulations.

A random sample of 78 cases (Part 1: Sibling Group Data)  comprising 164 children (Part 2: Individual Child Data) were collected  from three selected program sites: Lynchburg, Fairfax County, and  Virginia Beach, Virginia. Data for Parts 1 and 2 were gathered from  official records provided by CASA, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations  District Court, and t\nhe local Department of Social Services or  Department of Human Development (Child Protective Services and Foster  Care) files. Each chief judge, social services director, and CASA  program director was contacted directly to gain access to the  files. The information collected from these files included victim and  abuser demographics, characteristics of the case, previous abuse  history, family history, and court compliance information. Because  record-keeping strategies varied considerably across the three sites,  it was extremely difficult for researchers to obtain the same  information for each case. For Part 3 (Judges Data), a list of all  judges who were presiding in all operational CASA jurisdictions across  Virginia was compiled. Each judge on the list was sent an introductory  letter that explained the project and indicated that an evaluator  would be calling to schedule a convenient time to interview him/her by  phone. Interviewers subsequently called the judges to schedule  appointments and conduct the interviews. Actual interviews lasted  approximately 20-30 minutes. To encourage participation, judges were  also given the option of returning the survey in a written form,  which a small proportion of judges elected to do. For  Part 4 (Social Worker Data), a survey was distributed to all CASA  social workers in three sites who had worked or might have worked with  CASA volunteers. The survey instrument was reviewed by supervisors in  each site prior to distribution. Supervisors also distributed and  collected the surveys, which were accompanied by a explanatory letter  from the research and evaluation team. Because members of the  evaluation team were often on-site collecting data from social service  case files, respondents were able to speak with the evaluation team  regarding any questions concerning the survey instrument. Attached to  each survey was a sealable envelope to ensure respondent  confidentiality. Supervisors prompted social workers on two separate  occasions to complete and return their surveys, which were forwarded  to the evaluation team upon completion. Social workers who had not  worked with a CASA volunteer were asked to return the survey  unanswered, but to indicate on the form that they had no experience  with CASAs. Surveys returned unanswered were accounted for in the  response rate, but not included in the data. For Part 5 (Volunteer  Data), CASA program directors from all operational sites were  contacted and asked to compile a list of current CASA volunteers and  their addresses. The survey instrument (along with a stamped,  addressed envelope) was mailed to every active volunteer in all  operational program sites. Directors were asked to encourage all  volunteers to complete and return the survey. After the due date, all  directors were contacted on two separate occasions and informed of the  response rate of volunteers for their respective program, and again  encouraged to remind volunteers to complete and return their  surveys. After the last prompt and a fairly low response rate, the  Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) CASA program  coordinator was contacted and asked to facilitate volunteer participation."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were collected for a sample of 78 sibling  groups (Part 1) involving 164 children (Part 2).
