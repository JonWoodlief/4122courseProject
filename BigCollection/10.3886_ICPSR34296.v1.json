For race, the coding for individuals identified as being Hispanic/Latino, Asian, or Other were all grouped into the \"Other\" category. Lastly, the variables that asked for a specific year that an event took place (year diagnosed with HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis C, or when the person moved away from home for the first time) were removed from the data file and replaced with a variable providing the person's age of when the event took place using his or her year of birth.
