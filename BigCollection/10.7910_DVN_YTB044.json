We employed Qualtrics Labs, Inc. to conduct two large-scale data collections. The first lasted from September 2011 to December 2011. The second lasted from January 2012 to April 2012. We refer to these studies as WECT2011 and WECT2012, respectively. WECT2011 participants were not eligible to participate in WECT2012. Both studies had the same design (although there were several minor differences between them). Participants received compensation from for their participation ($53 for WECT2011 and $37 for WECT2012). Those who missed surveys or terminated their participation early received partial compensation based on the number of surveys they completed.\r\n\r\nAs part of this project, participants completed a total of 15 surveys over the course of three-months. The CFC data in this file come from the initial survey. We used the following 12-item scale:\r\nStrathman, A., Gleicher, F., Boninger, D. S., & Edwards, C. S. (1994).
