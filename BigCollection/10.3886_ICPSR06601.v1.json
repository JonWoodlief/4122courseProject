Simpson murder  trial. Respondents were asked how closely they followed recent news  about O.J. Simpson and the murders he was charged with. Respondents  were also asked whether the criminal justice system was biased toward  persons accused or against them, how much confidence they had that the  American criminal justice system generally makes the right decisions  about guilt and innocence, and, when wrong decisions are made by  criminal justice system, who they thought was most responsible:  prosecutors, judges, defense attorneys, or juries. The role of the  media and whether they\nhad been too harsh or too easy in coverage of  the O.J. Simpson trial were additional topics covered. Background  information on respondents includes voter registration status,  household composition, vote choice in the 1992 presidential election,  political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
