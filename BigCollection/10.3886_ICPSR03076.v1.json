This study was funded to examine the workings  of this court and its impact on the lives of victims. The four main  goals of the research were: (1) to describe the workings of the  primary components of this model jurisdiction in its response to  domestic violence, specifically (a) what the police actually did when  called to a domestic violence incident, (b) decisions made by the  prosecutor's office and the court in their handling of these  incidents, (c) how many victims talked to a victim advocate, and (d)  how many offenders received batterer treatment and/or were  incarcerated, (2) to describe the types of incidents, victims, and  offenders seen in a full enforcement jurisdiction to determine if the  types of cases coming to attention in such a setting looked similar to  cases reported in studies from other jurisdictions, (3) to interview  victims to hear directly about their experiences with a model court,  and (4) to examine how well this model jurisdiction worked in  preventing revictimization. Data used in this study were based on  domestic violence cases that resulted in an arrest and arraignment  before the Quincy District Court (QDC) during a seven-month study  period. Six types of data were collected for this study: (1) The  offender's criminal history prior to the study and for one year  subsequent to the study incident were provided by the QDC's Department  of Probation from the Massachusetts Criminal Records System Board. (2)  Civil restraining order data were provided by the Department of  Probation from a statewide registry of civil restraining orders. (3)  Data on prosecutorial charges for up to three domestic  violence-related charges were provided by the Department of  Probation. (4) Data on defendants who attended batterer treatment  programs were provided by directors of two such programs that served  the QDC. (5) Police incident reports from the seven departments served  by the QDC were used to measure the officer's perspective and actions  taken relating to each incident, what the call for service involved,  characteristics of the incident, socio-demographics of the  participants, their narrative descriptions of the incident, and their  stated response. (6) Interviews with victims were conducted one year  after the occurrence of the study incident. Variables from  administrative records include date and location of incident, number  of suspects, age and race of victims and offenders, use of weapons,  injuries, witnesses, whether there was an existing restraining order  and its characteristics, charges filed by police, number and gender of  police officers responding to the incident, victim's state at the time  of the incident, offender's criminal history, and whether the offender  participated in batterer treatment. The victim survey collected data  on the victim's education and employment status, current living  arrangement, relationship with offender, how the victim responded to  the incident, how afraid the victim was, victim's opinions of police  and the prosecutor, victim's sense of control, satisfaction with the  court, victim's past violent relationships and child sexual abuse,  victim's opinions on what the criminal justice system could do to stop abuse, and whether the victim obtained a restraining order."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Quincy District Court (QDC) serves eastern  Norfolk County, along Massachusetts' South Shore, an area of about 100  square miles. The court has jurisdiction for all juveniles and adults  charged with any misdemeanor or felony, provided the punishment for  the felony is limited to a maximum misdemeanor punishment. The QDC  initiated an aggressive, pro-intervention strategy for dealing with  domestic violence cases in 1986. This program was nationally  recognized by the Violence Against Women Office and the National  Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges as a model for its  integrated system-wide response to the myriad problems that typically  get clustered as \"domestic\" incidents (e.g., addiction, assault, and  abuse) by local police, court, and corrections administrators. This  study was funded to examine the workings of this court and its impact  on the lives of victims.

This distinction was made because this was the definition  utilized by the Violence Against Women Act, in which the assumption  was made that there are unique aspects to these relationships that  distinguish them from other types of domestic assault. Data used in  this study were based on domestic violence cases that resulted in an  arrest and arraignment before the Quincy District Court during a  seven-month study period. All consecutive arrests for domestic  violence involving male defendants and female victims that occurred  between June 1995 and February 1996 were initially examined for  inclusion in the final sample. From that pool the investigators  eliminated cases involving defendants and primary victims who were  under the age of 17, cases involving same-sex relationships, and cases  involving male victims and female defendants. The final sample was  composed of 353 cases of male-to-female domestic violence. It can be  described as a population since it included every case in this  category of incidents that occurred during the study's data collection  period. Six types of data were collected for this study: (1) The  offender's criminal history prior to the study and for one year  subsequent to the study incident were provided by the QDC's Department  of Probation from the Massachusetts Criminal Records System Board.
