The Person  Record file (Part 2) includes information on sex, age, race, marital  status, Hispanic origin, education, veteran status, family income,  family size, major activities, health status, activity limits,  employment status, and industry and occupation. These variables are  found in the Condition, Doctor Visit, and Hospital Record files as  well. The Person Record also supplies data on height, weight, bed  days, doctor visits, hospital stays, years at residence, and region  variables. The Condition Record file (Part 3) contains information for  each reported health condition, with specifics on injury and accident  reports. The Doctor Visit Record file (Part 4) documents doctor visits  within the time period and identifies acute or chronic conditions.

The sample for the NHIS is redesigned every decade using population  data from the most recent decennial census. A redesigned sample was  implemented in 1995, so the sample design for 1996 is different from  the sample designs in 1994 and earlier years of the NHIS. This new  design includes a greater number of prima\nry sampling units (PSUs)  (from 198 in 1994 to 358 for the 1995 design), and a more complicated  nonresponse adjustment based on household screening and oversampling  of Black and Hispanic persons for more reliable estimates of these  groups. Additionally, the 1996 population estimates were adjusted to  the national population estimates by age, sex, and race/ethnicity,  based on projections from the 1990 United States Census. Part of the  1996 NHIS sample was used for testing of the computer-assisted  personal interview (CAPI) system that was implemented for the 1997  NHIS. The CAPI test cases are not included in the 1996 public use  file. Relative to 1995, the 1996 NHIS sample size was reduced by  approximately 25 percent in the first and second quarters, and by 50 percent in the third and fourth quarters."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Condition Record","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41552,"dataFile":{"id":2661020,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Condition Record","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Doctor Visit Record","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41552,"dataFile":{"id":2661021,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Doctor Visit Record","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Hospital Record","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41552,"dataFile":{"id":2661022,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Hospital Record","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Household Record","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41552,"dataFile":{"id":2661018,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Household Record","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Person Record","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41552,"dataFile":{"id":2661019,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Person Record","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
