The follow-up study attempted  to include all individuals contained in the original sample. However,  the California Bureau of Criminal Statistics and the California Bureau  of Criminal Investigation were not able to provide records for all  individuals, and attrition occurred for a variety of reasons. No  records were provided for some individuals who had died. In some  instances the individual was not released from prison. Some records  were unusable (e.g., missing pages). A number of records were  \"purged\" from the California system if the individual had reached  age 70 and there were no known arrests in the prior ten years. These  sources of attrition resulted in a follow-up sample of 4,897  individuals. Attrition may result in some sample bias. All deaths of  individuals from the original sample may not be recorded, and  unrecorded deaths may inflate the amount of time free without  arrest. Complete records of out-of-state arrests were not available,  and this may also inflate time without arrest. Purging of records  should counteract the effects of unrecorded deaths and out-of-state  arrests, since those remaining in the sample would tend to have had  more arrests. The researchers compared characteristics of purged and  retained cases and concluded that there appears to be little serious bias associated with sample attrition."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data gathered for predictor variables include age  of the individual, prior periods of arrest, history of drug use, type  of offense, and seriousness of offense.
