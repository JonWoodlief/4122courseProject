PLTC policies combine private long-term care insurance with special Medicaid eligibility standards that protect assets of the insured once private insurance benefits are exhausted. This collection was extracted from a database compiled from data submitted by three of the PLTC states: California, Connecticut, and Indiana (New York refused participation). It comprises seven parts, which can be linked together using common identifying variables. Part 1, Insured, describes the characteristics of each issued policy and includes variables covering the effective policy date, policy type, elimination periods, maximum benefits, inflation protection mode, and annualized premium, as well as the year of birth, sex, marital status, and state of residence of the insured. Each insured person is represented by one or more records: one record for the initial PLTC policy, plus a separate record for each change to the policy, if any. Part 2, Changes, consists of policy change records used to update the policies in Part 1. Assessments for benefits are recorded in Part 3. This file includes variables on the assessment date, whether the insured met policy criteria at the time of the assessment, disability date, deficiencies in activities of daily living, and MSQ and Folstein test scores. Parts 4-6 describe service payments and utilization: reporting period (quarter), type of service received by the insured, service amount billed, days of service rendered, and amount of remaining benefits (dollars and days). Part 7 contains information on persons denied application to PLTC policies, including date of denial, type and amount of coverage sought, reason for denial, and the sex, year of birth, and marital status of the applicant."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance payments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"long term care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"long term care insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicaid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA II.
