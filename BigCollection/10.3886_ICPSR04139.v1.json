The CCEB provides decision-makers and the  European public with opinion data on the similarities and differences  between the EU and the candidate countries. The CCEB continuously  tracks support for EU membership in each country and records changes  in attitudes related to European issues in the candidate countries.  This round of the CCEB surveys was conducted between October 16 and  November 17, 2002, in the 13 candidate countries: Bulgaria, Cyprus,  Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,  Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey. Respondents were queried on  how interested and informed they were about science and technology,  sports, politics, economics and finance, and culture, which  professions they held in high regard (e.g., judges, medical doctors,  politicians, or scientists), and who they would trust to explain the  reasons for a major disaster (e.g., scientists, journalists, or  government representatives). Respondents were asked which scientific  and technological developments interested them most (e.g., medicine,  genetics, astronomy and space, or the Internet), how scientific they  felt certain subjects were, such as biology, history, economics,  mathematics, or sociology, and whether they understood certain  concepts and phenomena as reported in the newspapers and on the  television, like air pollution, global warning, the greenhouse effect,  holes in the ozone layer, nanotechnologies, and bovine spongiform  encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease). Respondents were further  asked a series of true and false questions regarding science-based  statements (e.g., the center of the Earth is hot, radioactive milk can  be safe if boiled, electrons are smaller than atoms, the Sun goes  around the Earth, and human beings developed from earlier species of  animals). Respondents were also asked if they agreed with statements  concerning science and technology and how science and technology  affected or will affect everyday living, the environment, industrial  development, and the fight to cure illnesses. Respondents were  further questioned on whether they agreed with statements concerning  ethical standards, genetically modified food, the way in which the  media reported on science and technology, and the responsibility of  scientists, politicians, farmers, and the food industry in relation to  mad cow disease. The survey also addressed policy areas in which the  EU should or should not be active (e.g., agriculture, environment,  international trade, foreign affairs, defense, energy, consumer  protection, employment and social affairs, and regional development),  as well as how research carried out at the national level compared to  research at the EU level and whether the respondent agreed with a  series of statements regarding important scientific and technological  developments (i.e., the Internet and biotechnology) originating  outside of Europe. Demographic variables include sex, age,  nationality, marital status, level of education, current occupation,  income, whether the respondent lived in a rural area or village, small  or middle sized town, or large town, religious affiliation, and voting intent."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"science"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"scientific research"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
