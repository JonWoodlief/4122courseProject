To that end, the DTE program provided random, weekly drug  tests to all clients in the program. These urinalysis tests allowed  DTE to monitor each client's compliance with release conditions and  progress in treatment programs, and to intervene appropriately when a  client showed signs of a drug abuse problem. The DTE program  supplemented drug testing with client drug evaluations and treatment  recommendations, which were provided to the client's probation officer  or case manager. This study was a program evaluation of two of DTE's  divisions: the Pretrial Release Supervision Program (PRSP) and the  probation and parole program. The pretrial division was chosen because  it was the first opportunity for the criminal justice system to  supervise and control the drug use of potential DTE clients. The  probation and parole program was selected for three reasons: it was  the largest component of the DTE program, it linked the pretrial and  post-sentence DTE programs, and the experience of this program could  be readily applied to the development of other such programs in other  jurisdictions. The programs were evaluated using administrative data  collected by corrections technicians, case managers, probation and  parole officers, and the DTE central office. Part 1 (Pretrial Data)  variables include dates of entry into and exit from the program,  number of drug tests, number of positive tests for various drugs, type  of offense and arrest date for each offense, and need assessment  rating for medical, employment, legal, family, psychological, and drug  addiction problems. Part 2 (Probation and Parole Data) variables  include a probation or parole indicator, prior drug arrests, prior  non-drug arrests, prior convictions, technical violations, drug use,  and new drug crimes committed during the program.
