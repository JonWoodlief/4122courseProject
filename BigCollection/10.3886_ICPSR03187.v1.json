The purposes of the study were (1) to analyze  the nature and circumstances of incidents of felonious police killings  and (2) to analyze trends in the numbers and rates of killings across  different types of agencies and to explain these differences. For Part  1, Incident-Level Data, an incident-level database was created to  capture all incidents involving the death of a police officer from  1983 through 1992. Data on officers and incidents were collected from  the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) data  collection as coded by the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. In  addition to the UCR data, the Police Foundation also coded information  from the LEOKA narratives that are not part of the computerized LEOKA  database from the FBI. For Part 2, Agency-Level Data, the researchers  created an agency-level database to research systematic differences  among rates at which law enforcement officers had been feloniously  killed from 1977 through 1992. The investigators focused on the 56  largest law enforcement agencies because of the availability of data  for explanatory variables. Variables in Part 1 include year of  killing, involvement of other officers, if the officer was killed with  his/her own weapon, circumstances of the killing, location of fatal  wounds, distance between officer and offender, if the victim was  wearing body armor, if different officers were killed in the same  incident, if the officer was in uniform, actions of the killer and of  the officer at entry and final stage, if the killer was visible at  first, if the officer thought the killer was a felon suspect, if the  officer was shot at entry, and circumstances at anticipation, entry,  and final stages. Demographic variables for Part 1 include victim's  sex, age, race, type of assignment, rank, years of experience, agency,  population group, and if the officer was working a security job. Part  2 contains variables describing the general municipal environment,  such as whether the agency is located in the South, level of poverty  according to a poverty index, population density, percent of  population that was Hispanic or Black, and population aged 15-34 years  old. Variables capturing the crime environment include the violent  crime rate, property crime rate, and a gun-related crime  index. Lastly, variables on the environment of the police agencies  include violent and property crime arrests per 1,000 sworn officers,  percentage of officers injured in assaults, and number of sworn officers."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Although many police policies are designed to  protect officers from the threat of violence and a great deal of  training is dedicated to teaching officers how to thwart assaults,  researchers have paid little attention to the subject of police\nkillings.
