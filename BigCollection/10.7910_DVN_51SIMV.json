Its purpose is to provide reliable statistical information allowing users to make meaningful comparisons between these countries. Accordingly, definitions of concepts and aggregates from national authorities are provided. The package contains nominal and real data on major time series such as outstanding consumer credit, loans for house purchase, loans to non-financial corporations and annual final consumption expenditures of households. Data are presented in euro and in national currency. In addition, ratios of household indebtedness are calculated and illustrated by graphs. It also includes breakdowns of the various credit statistics by maturity and currency.\r\n\r\nFor some countries, tables presenting the composition of consumer credit stocks by lender and by instrument are also available.
