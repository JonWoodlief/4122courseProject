Prior to President George W. Bush's January 28, 2003, State of the Union address, respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bush and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy. Respondents were asked to specify whether the war on terror, the situation in Iraq, or the United States economy was most important for the government to address, as well as their opinion of the condition of the national economy, whether they expected their taxes to increase, decrease, or stay the same in the next two years, and whether taxes should be cut or the federal budget deficit reduced. Views were sought on whether President Bush was leading the country in the right direction, if respondents were confident in his ability to handle an international crisis, if he had strong leadership qualities, whether he cared about the needs and problems of people like themselves, and if he shared the same priorities as the respondent. Respondents were also asked if they approved of the United States taking military action against Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power, even if it resulted in substantial United States military casualties, if the situation with Iraq would be resolved without fighting, if United States military action against Iraq would increase the threat of terrorism, and who they believed was currently winning the war against terrorism. Respondents polled immediately after the State of the Union Address were asked if George W. Bush had the same priorities they did, how his proposed tax cuts would affect the economy, if they expected their taxes to increase or decrease in the next two years, if they approved of the United States taking military action against Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein, and if the U.S. should wait or take military action soon.
