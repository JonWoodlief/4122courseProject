This survey, fielded August 10, 2000, is a call-back of the August 4-6, 2000, cohort (CBS NEWS MONTHLY POLL #1, AUGUST 2000 [ICPSR 3109]), and was conducted to assess respondent views regarding the 2000 presidential campaign. Opinions we\nre gathered on Texas governor George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, and Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman. Respondents were asked how much attention they were paying to the campaign, whether they planned on watching the Democratic Party convention, which candidate, Bush or Gore, they intended to vote for, whether that decision was firm, whether the choice of Cheney and Lieberman as vice-presidential candidates would affect their decision, and if they were happy with the choices for vice president. Respondents were queried on the leadership qualities of Bush and Gore and whether they were trying to bring different groups of Americans together or divide them. A series of questions was also asked on whether Lieberman had the right experience to be a good vice president, whether Gore's selection of Lieberman as his running mate affected the respondent's opinion of Gore, whether their opinion of Gore was affected by the Clinton Administration's scandals, and if choosing Lieberman would help distance Gore from the Clinton Administration. Respondents were asked if they knew what religion Cheney and Lieberman were, whether they would vote for a Jewish president, if America was ready for a Jewish president or vice president, and whether they were likely to vote for a Jewish candidate, a non-Jewish candidate, a candidate of their own religion, or if religion was a factor at all in determining which candidate to support. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, veteran status, voter registration and participation history, political party, political orientation, Hispanic descent, marital status, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
