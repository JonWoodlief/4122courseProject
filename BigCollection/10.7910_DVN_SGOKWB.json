Understanding magnetic reconnection thus requires study of the stability of a current sheet as it forms. Formation can occur due to sheared, sub-Alfv\u0013enic incompressible  flows which narrow the sheet. Standard tearing theory (Furth et al. 1963; Coppi et al. 1976; Rutherford 1973) is not immediately applicable to such forming sheets for two reasons: \ffirst, because the  flow introduces terms not present in the standard calculation; second, because the changing equilibrium introduces time dependence to terms which are constant in the standard calculation, complicating the formulation of an eigenvalue problem. This paper adapts standard tearing mode analysis to confront these challenges. In an initial phase when any perturbations are primarily governed by ideal MHD, a coordinate transformation reveals that the  flow compresses and stretches perturbations. A multiple scale formulation describes how linear tearing mode theory (Furth et al. 1963; Coppi et al. 1976) can be applied to an equilibrium changing under  flow, showing that tearing eigenfunctions grow slowly due to the flow and undergo exponential growth at a rate given by standard scalings with time dependence added. In the nonlinear Rutherford stage, the coordinate transformation shows that standard theory can be adapted by adding to the stationary rates time dependence and an additional term due to the strengthening equilibrium magnetic \ffield. Overall, this understanding supports the use of  flow-free scalings with slight modifications to study tearing in a forming sheet."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"flow"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"incompressible"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reconnection"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"RMHD"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tearing"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/17ja/17ja039/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-17-39</a><br /><br />This work was supported by The National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. 1122374; NSF-DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering, Award No. DE-SC0016215; DOE Award No. DE-SC0008409 (for our collaborator at the University of Colorado); and NASA Award No. NNX16AB28G (for our collaborator at the University of Colorado)."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"17ja039_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149405,"dataFile":{"id":3343193,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"17ja039_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1007170,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168395f2ad4-8c64ee96b458","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3234d7cf4fbc4f93dc61dd484da47e09","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3234d7cf4fbc4f93dc61dd484da47e09"}}}]}}}
