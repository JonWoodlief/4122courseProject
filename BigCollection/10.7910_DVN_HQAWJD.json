Participants were drawn from areas within a fifty-mile radius of five cities chosen to cover the major geographic regions of the United States: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco. The participants were drawn from a larger, nationally representative sample of American adults, the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development (MIDUS) conducted by the M\nacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife Development.\n<br /><br />In two- to three-hour interviews, participants were asked to talk about their life histories and what they do for their families, friends, and communities; about their paid work and volunteer work; their political engagement; and their financial contributions to charities and directly to other people. The interviews were taped and transcribed. In addition, structured summaries of the interviews were constructed by trained coders.<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analo\ngue materials for this study (94 transcribed interviews, summaries of 90 interviews, and computer files of data coded from the interviews and MIDUS survey responses for the 94 participants).
