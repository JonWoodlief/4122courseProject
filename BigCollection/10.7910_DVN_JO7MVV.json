Yet, 45% (100 species) of forest timber species could only grow up to sapling stage, i.e did not survive to higher level grows. The species composition had significantly changed, from forest species to pioneer species. On the other hand, keeping secondary grows after fire event and practicing agroforestry systems would enable to maintain approximately 51% (32 species) of forest species vegetation. The results showed that by integrating land use systems (comprising monoculture plantation, secondary forest and agroforestry system as a mosaic landscape) enabled to conserve at least 222 timber sapling species, 73 pole species and 63 tree species through maintaining seed availability, allocating sites for species to regenerate, and providing corridors for animals and seed dispersers to pass by. All timber species within 24 plots of 20 m x 100 m across Lubuk Beringin village (Bungo District, Jambi Province) covering remnant forest in protected forest, rubber agroforest of 60 years old, secondary forest of 30 and 10 years old and rubber monoculture of 30 years and 13 years old had been identified consisting of tree stage (more than 30 cm in diameter), pole stage (5-30 cm in diameter using 5 m x 40 m), sapling stage (less than 5 cm and more than 30 cm in height using 1 m x 4 m plots).
