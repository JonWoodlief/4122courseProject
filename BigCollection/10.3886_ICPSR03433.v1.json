Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, the economy, and the situation between Israel and the Palestinians. Respondents also expressed their views on the United States campaign against terrorism, the situation regarding Osama bin Laden, and the support given to the United States by Muslim people around the world. In addition, respondents voiced their concerns about more future terrorist attacks on the United States, their feelings toward Israel and the Palestinians, and their views on the role of the United States in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and the pursuit of peace in the Middle East. The poll elicited respondents' views on the influence of Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit to the Middle East on the prospects for peace, the negotiations and actions taken by Israel and the Palestinians, the responsibility of the leader of the Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat for terrorist attacks against Israel by Palestinians, the support of the United States for Israel, and the United States efforts in the war on terrorism. Respondents also answered a set of questions regarding the Catholic Church, its handling the issue of sexual abuse of children by priests, the level of trust respondents felt toward the Church in handling this issue in the future, their opinions of Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, who was accused of mishandling the issue of sexual abuse of children by priests, and the outcome of the American cardinals' meeting at the Vatican.
