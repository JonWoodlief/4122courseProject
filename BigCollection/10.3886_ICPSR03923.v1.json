The SCPS  provided detailed legal and extralegal data on felony defendants and  their cases from 39 large urban counties across 17 states. These data  were merged with a county-level dataset created specifically for this  project. The county-level data provided detailed information on key  community characteristics, such as the unemployment rate, crime rates,  region, racial composition, sex ratio, age structure, political  orientation, religious affiliation, and sentencing structures.  County-level indicators of unemployment rates, racial composition, age  structure, sex ratio, and geographic location were collected from the  County and City Data Books (2000) and the Census Bureau Summary Tape  Files (2000). County-level crime rates were gathered from the Federal  Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) for the year  preceding the felony case filings (1997). Information on religious  group affiliation at the county-level was obtained from the United  States Census of Churches (1997). County-level indicators of  political orientation were collected from the American National  Election Study (1996). Finally, indicators of type of sentencing  structure and guidelines at the county-level were gathered from the  United States Department of Justice National Survey of State  Sentencing Structures (1998). The merged data were used to assess the  main and conditioning effects of several community conditions on the  nature and severity of sentences received by individual defendants.  Sentenci\nng outcomes were measured by (1) the incarceration decision,  (2) the nature of the specific sentence, and (3) the length of  confinement term received.
