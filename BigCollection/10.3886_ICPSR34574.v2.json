The variables V3 and V501 designate the form number and grade respectively. Each variable label, at the end, lists which forms the question was asked on. A new missing value (-8) is used to distinguish those cases where the variable was not asked on a particular form.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: To protect the anonymity of respondents, all variables that could be used to identify individuals have been collapsed or recoded in the public use files. These modifications should not affect analytic uses of the public use files.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Variables omitted from the Western region questionnaires are noted in each codebook.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: A user guide is provided with the study documentation.

The MTF sample is drawn to generate representative samples of the four Census Bureau regions of the country (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), but it does not generate representative samples of smaller geographic areas such as states, counties, or cities.

The substances include tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, LSD, other psychedelics, amphetamines, sedatives/barbiturates, tranquilizers, inhalants, and other narcotics. These variables have been placed at the end of the file.

Generally speaking, in schools\nwith more than 350 students in the grade, a sample of students or classes was drawn. In schools with fewer than 350 students in a grade, all students were asked to participate unless logistical challenges required a sample be taken. For the 8th-grade survey, schools with fewer than 20 8th graders were generally excluded from the sample. For the 10th-grade survey, schools with fewer than 25 10th graders were excluded, with very few exceptions.  Each school was asked to participate for two years so that each year one-half of the sample would be replaced. Schools refusing participation were replaced with similar schools in terms of geographic location, size, and type of school (e.g., public, private/Catholic, private/non-Catholic).
