We argue that the objective of saving lives\r\nis best served by a careful balancing of fairness and efficiency considerations. Open, fair, and\r\nequitable access to health care for all citizens will lower overall mortality rates by enabling the very\r\npoor and chronically ill to satisfy their demand for necessary health care. But it will also result in\r\nhigher costs, not least by also increasing demand for irrelevant, unnecessary, and inefficient health\r\ncare. This undesirable demand and its associated costs can be reduced by increasing out-of-pocket\r\ncontributions paid for by patients. Such payments are unpopular, though, as they are regarded\r\nas regressive and damaging to health of the relatively poor. We argue that properly enacted, no\r\nsuch apparent trade-offs exist. If the freed-up resources are used for more life-saving measures,\r\nthen higher out-of-pocket contributions will lower overall mortality rates. However, this beneficial\r\neffect is conditional on what happens to total health spending. Ironically, out-of-pocket payments\r\nare most effective as health policies if they are not or only hardly used as a means of reducing\r\ntotal health expenditures. Our theoretical arguments are confirmed by an econometric analysis of\r\naggregate mortality rates in OECD countries over the period 1984 to 2007."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-02-26"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for Public Administration (mortality).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124361,"dataFile":{"id":3002866,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/PQCA6M/3SDHXB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PQCA6M/3SDHXB","filename":"Article for Public Administration (mortality).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":9228,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a79ca603b-7f079c72a30f","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0357f4380adea874eabd69416a8f1515","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0357f4380adea874eabd69416a8f1515"}}},{"label":"Article for Public Administration (mortality).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":124361,"dataFile":{"id":3002867,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/PQCA6M/KMOPAQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PQCA6M/KMOPAQ","filename":"Article for Public Administration (mortality).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":111899,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a79ca6544-63d0a7416afb","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:4Ps4m+FhJ049ICYon3a9OA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6b27d57f77d941f0a1bc05828837ef90","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6b27d57f77d941f0a1bc05828837ef90"}}}]}}}
