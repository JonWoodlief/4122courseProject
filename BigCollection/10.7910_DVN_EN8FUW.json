Societal events of interest included civil unrest, disease outbreaks, and election results. Geographic areas of interest include countries in Latin America (LA) and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\r\nThe handbook is intended to serve as a reference document for the OSI Program and a companion to the ground truth event data used for test and evaluation. The handbook provides guidance regarding the types of events considered; the submission of automated predictions or “warnings;” the development of ground truth; the test and evaluation of submitted warnings; performance measures; and other programmatic information.\r\n\r\nIARPA initiated a solicitation for OSI Research Teams in late summer 2011 for one base year and two option years of research. MITRE was selected as the Test and Evaluation (T&E) Team in November 2011. Following a review of proposals, three teams (BBN, HRL, and Virginia Tech (VT)) were selected. The OSI Program officially began in April 2012; manual event encoding and formal T&E ended in March 2015. \r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-01-25"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Reed, Terry"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-01-25"}]}},"files":[{"description":"OSI Program Handbook","label":"Open Source Indicators Handbook--PRS 16-4297.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124086,"dataFile":{"id":2971734,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EN8FUW/IE6KFE","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EN8FUW/IE6KFE","filename":"Open Source Indicators Handbook--PRS 16-4297.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1653095,"description":"OSI Program Handbook","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:159d70022a0-888ed5adfb05","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"be927b55def5145306bdc2ae2ad0aa6b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"be927b55def5145306bdc2ae2ad0aa6b"}}},{"description":"OSI Ground Truth","label":"OSI GSR May 2013 - March 2015_PRS 16-4297.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124086,"dataFile":{"id":2971805,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EN8FUW/RWIXGJ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EN8FUW/RWIXGJ","filename":"OSI GSR May 2013 - March 2015_PRS 16-4297.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":12651520,"description":"OSI Ground Truth","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:159d74eeb77-bf23329fab20","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"acbd34bf5ea378a08624cdfff22d5b34","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"acbd34bf5ea378a08624cdfff22d5b34"}}}]}}}
