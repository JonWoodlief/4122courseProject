The researchers also sought to better inform the development and provision of services targeted to delinquent youth in residential care by exploring whether characteristics assessed at intake into care predict adult offending risk. The research team tracked a large sample of delinquent boys and girls released from juvenile correctional facilities/programs in New York State in the early 1990s and used state administrative databases to document their involvement with criminal justice and child protective services in young adulthood. Sample youth were initially drawn from a research database originally created to examine short-term criminal recidivism rates and associated risk factors among known juvenile delinquents (Frederick, 1999). As part of that study, a comprehensive list of adjudicated delinquents discharged from the custody of the New York State (NYS) Division of Youth between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1994, was generated. The research team selected a stratified, random subsample of 999 youths with case reviews and tracked them forward through time from age 16 to age 28. The Administrative/Case File Review Data (Part 1) contain information on the experiences prior to being admitted into state custody of 999 youths. Specifically, Part 1 includes early risk factors taken from items coded during the initial recidivism study conducted by Frederick (1999). Part 1 also includes information on a youth’s childhood experiences with child welfare services collected by the research team as part of this study. Information on a youth's prior receipt of child welfare services was obtained by extracting records from the NYS Child Care Review Service system (CCRS). The Child Protective Services Reports Data (Part 2) contain information on the sampled subjects’ involvement with Child Protective Services (CPS) as young adults (ages 16-28). CPS data were collected by conducting person-based searches of CONNECTIONS, the NYS Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System. For Part 2, adult perpetration of child maltreatment outcome data were collected on a total of 1,543 child protective services (CPS) reports. The Criminal History Data (Part 3) contain information on the sampled subjects’ early adult involvement (ages 16-28) with the NYS adult criminal justice system. The research team documented adult crime and perpetration of child abuse and neglect via searches of two independent state administrative databases: (1) the NYS Offender-Based Transaction Statistics Computerized Criminal History (OBTS/CCH) database, which records all New York state-based arrests of individuals age 16 or older from point of arrest through disposition and sentencing; (2) the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) database, which tracks all New York State prison admissions and discharges. For Part 3, data were collected on a total of 6,627 adult arrest events. Part 1 contains 30 variables detailing information on the study participants, including demographic variables and variables related to offense history, individual functioning, child maltreatment, receipt of child welfare services, and family environm\nent. Part 2 includes 22 variables derived from child protective services (CPS) reports linked to a study participant, including variables relating to the participant's perpetration of child maltreatment, type of alleged maltreatment, investigation outcome, and outcome variables reflecting participants' involvement in various types of maltreatment allegations.

Specifically, Part 1 includes early risk factors reflective of a youth's offense history (e.g., age at first juvenile arrest, prior violent arrest), mental health need, substance use, history of physical abuse, history of sexual abuse, and family environment taken from items coded during the initial recidivism study conducted by Frederick (1999), which were based on reviews of a youth's court records, probation reports, intake and home assessments, and service plans.

CPS data were collected by conducting person-based searches of CONNECTIONS, the New York State (NYS) Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System. First, participants' name, sex, and date of birth were manually entered into CONNECTIONS via a phonetic-based search engine, and a computer-generated list of potential system matches was generated. Potential system matches were then manually reviewed and evaluated by experienced CONNECTIONS users based on the informatio\nn contained in the master search file. To ensure match quality and ongoing reliability, system searches were independently conducted and evaluated by two members of the research team for a subsample of participants. Disputed matches were resolved through discussion. For Part 2, adult perpetration of child maltreatment outcome data were collected on a total of 1,543 child protective services (CPS) reports. Aggregated information pertaining to a participant's overall type and amount of CPS involvement is also provided, and is attached to each report attributed to a given individual.</p>\n\n<p>The Criminal History Data (Part 3) contain information on the sampled subjects’ early adult involvement (ages 16-28) with the NYS adult criminal justice system.

To identify records for extraction and coding, lists of potential, computer-generated, person matches were created using key identifiers (e.g., participant name, date of birth, Social Security number) as search terms. Potential matches were then manually evaluated, based on the goodness-of-fit observed between the returned record and identifiers recorded in the youth's case files. To ensure data quality, specific matching criteria were developed for each system and a subsample of matches was independently reviewed by multiple coders. For Part 3, data were collected on a total of 6,627 adult arrest events.

Offense history variables include the youth's age at first arrest, age at first placement with OCFS, the number of arrest charges brought against the youth in the 12 months prior to his/her OCFS placement, and a series of dichotomous variables capturing prior arrest for violent crime, prior arrest for weapons-related charges, evidence of involvement in gang activity, and prior out-of-home placement for juvenile justice reasons. Individual functioning variables include whether the participant had abused marijuana, alcohol, or hard drugs prior to entering state custody, a four-point scale measuring overall substance abuse, and whether the participant had substantial mental health needs. Child maltreatment variables include whether the youth were ever physically or sexually abused by a parent, family or household member, or other adult prior to OCFS placement, and two dichotomous indicators of prior abuse, namely physical abuse and sexual abuse, compiled by aggregating items across identified perpetrators. Receipt of child welfare services variables include whether the participant had ever received child welfare services or foster care services.
