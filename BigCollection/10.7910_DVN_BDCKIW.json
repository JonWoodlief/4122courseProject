While the investment potential might be lucrative, there is always the risk that the host government will expropriate the profits and assets of the foreign investor. Political institutions, however, can serve as constraints on the actions of political actors in the host country. We argue that federal structures lower political risk. Joint-reputational accountability in overlapping political jurisdictions increases the likelihood that investment contracts will be honored. Empirical analyses of cross-sectional time-series data for 115 countries, from 1975-1995, are used to study how political institutions affect foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. After controlling for the effect of relevant economic and political variables, we find that both democratic and federal institutions help attract FDI, although the additive effect of democracy and federalism is small. This is not surprising; democratic systems already have low political risk; they do not need the additional credibility that the federal system provides to attract FDI. In contrast, we expect that federal structures significantly improve the trustworthiness of less democratic states. Empirically, we find that less democratic countries with federal political systems attract some of the highest levels of FDI."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-09-27"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"JensenReplication.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68408,"dataFile":{"id":1544594,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"JensenReplication.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":285742,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:54118","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6905308d742bdc047e46556b9a029196","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6905308d742bdc047e46556b9a029196"}}}]}}}
