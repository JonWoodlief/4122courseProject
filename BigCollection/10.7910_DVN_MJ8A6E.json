A number of proxy variables\r\nare used in lieu of environmental commitment, a non-observable variable. Strong evidence is found\r\nthat democracies sign and ratify more multilateral environmental agreements, participate in more\r\nenvironmental intergovernmental organizations, comply better with reporting requirements under the\r\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora, put a greater percentage\r\nof their land area under protections status, are more likely to have a National Council on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in their country and have more environmentally relevant information available than\r\nnon-democracies. The findings suggest that a spread of democracy around the world will lead to\r\nenhanced environmental commitment worldwide. Results are robust with respect to inclusion or\r\nexclusion of developed countries in the sample. The use of four different variables for democracy also\r\nensures robustness with respect to the measure of democracy. The strong evidence in favour of a positive\r\nlink between democracy and environmental commitment stands in contrast to the somewhat weak evidence\r\non such a link between democracy and environmental outcomes. The explanation presumably is\r\nthat theory predicts a stronger positive link of democracy with environmental commitment than with\r\nenvironmental outcomes."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-02-19"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for JPR (env commitment).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124251,"dataFile":{"id":3001788,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MJ8A6E/69FYZI","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MJ8A6E/69FYZI","filename":"Article for JPR (env commitment).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":8281,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a568a6e66-c57a8815d84a","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0547cc5f2d65489cfd3c5529f20bbf0c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0547cc5f2d65489cfd3c5529f20bbf0c"}}},{"label":"Article for JPR (env commitment).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":124251,"dataFile":{"id":3001787,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MJ8A6E/MVJLNV","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MJ8A6E/MVJLNV","filename":"Article for JPR (env commitment).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":24805,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a568a72ab-434bb145257a","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:HcHvYcalluRXbpyFa++XIg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f84df2239213b8f3a3e0f27f7c6c1ed4","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f84df2239213b8f3a3e0f27f7c6c1ed4"}}}]}}}
