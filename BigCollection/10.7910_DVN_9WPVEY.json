One local food organization is the consumer food cooperative. Scholars have argued that the preferences some consumers hold for beneficial social outcomes in addition to personal gain may influence the success of various organizations and business models, and effect market evolution. We investigate the possibility that prosocial and cooperative behavior may in part underlie the rise of new organizational forms and the growth of the local food economy.\r\n\r\nAll organizations must overcome social dilemmas and collective action problems using cooperation or coordination to remain viable. But organizations also vary in structure, composition and circumstance, with some requiring greater levels of individual cooperation than others. In contrast to many organizational types, consumer food cooperatives are explicitly focused on the cooperative action of members and include features, such as collective decision-making, which are known to support cooperation. However, organizational influences on human cooperation have not been measured experimentally. We hypothesize that consumer food cooperatives will attract or create greater levels of generalized cooperation than conventional grocery stores.\r\n\r\nTo test this hypothesis, we conducted an experimental dictator game to measure cooperation among consumers at a food cooperative and a comparable conventional grocery. Results show that cooperative customers exhibit a higher base rate of cooperation than similar conventional food shoppers. Multiple regression reveals that the relationship holds even when taking individual demographic factors such as income, education, and age into account. We argue that the organizational structure of consumer food cooperatives may increase realized prosocial attitudes and economic cooperation."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-07-07"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management","Social Sciences","Other"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cooperation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prosociality"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local food"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food co-op"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"experimental economics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"dictator game"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sustainability"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"submitted: Journal of Renewable Agriculture and Forestry"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables are described in the R code file."},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Waring, Timothy"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-07-07"},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey responses and dictator game contributions."]}]}},"files":[{"description":"An R code file to conduct a simple analysis of the data provided in the associated CSV file.","label":"Tremblay_Waring_analysis.R","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":85432,"categories":["Code"],"dataFile":{"id":2849771,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/9WPVEY/1HVWFL","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9WPVEY/1HVWFL","filename":"Tremblay_Waring_analysis.R","contentType":"type/x-r-syntax","filesize":3600,"description":"An R code file to conduct a simple analysis of the data provided in the associated CSV file.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:155c6c3dee3-04b1574bd227","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a4f2c083ed139a81c10baa4ea9c65fda","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a4f2c083ed139a81c10baa4ea9c65fda"}}},{"description":"A CSV datafile for use with the R code provided.
