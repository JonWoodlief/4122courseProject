In the long term, Weed and Seed programs are intended  to reduce levels of crime, violence, drug trafficking, and fear of  crime, and to create new jobs, improve housing, enhance the quality of  neighborhood life, and reduce alcohol and drug use. This baseline data  collection effort is the initial step toward assessing the achievement  of the long-term objectives. The evaluation was conducted using a  quasi-experimental design, matching households in comparison  neighborhoods with the Weed and Seed target neighborhoods. Comparison  neighborhoods were chosen to match Weed and Seed target neighborhoods  on the basis of crime rates, population demographics, housing  characteristics, and size and density. Neighborhoods in eight sites  were selected: Akron, OH, Bradenton (North Manatee), FL, Hartford, CT,  Las Vegas, NV, Pittsburgh, PA, Salt Lake City, UT, Seattle, WA, and  Shreveport, LA. The \"neighborhood\" in Hartford, CT, was actually a  public housing development, which is part of the reason for the  smaller number of interviews at this site. Baseline data collection  tasks included the completion of in-person surveys with residents in  the target and matched comparison neighborhoods, and the provision of  guidance to the sites in the collection of important process data on a  routine uniform basis. The survey questions can be broadly divided  into these areas: (1) respondent demographics, (2) household size and  income, (3) perceptions of the neighborhood, and (4) perceptions of  city services. Questions addressed in the course of gathering the  baseline data include: Are the target and comparison areas  sufficiently well-matched that analytic contrasts between the areas  over time are valid? Is there evidence that the survey measures are  accurate and valid measures of the dependent variables of interest --  fear of crime, victimization, etc.? Are the sample sizes and response  rates sufficient to provide ample statistical power for later  analyses? Variables cover respondents' perceptions of the  neighborhood, safety and observed security measures, police  effectiveness, and city services, as well as their ratings of  neighborhood crime, disorder, and other problems. Other items included  respondents' experiences with victimization, calls/contacts with  police and satisfaction with police response, and involvement in  community meetings and events. Demographic information on respondents  includes year of birth, gender, ethnicity, household income, and employment status."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Department of Justice launched Operation Weed  and Seed in 1991 as a means of mobilizing a large and varied array of  resources in a comprehensive, coordinated effort to control crime and  drug problems and improve th\ne quality of life in targeted high-crime  neighborhoods.
