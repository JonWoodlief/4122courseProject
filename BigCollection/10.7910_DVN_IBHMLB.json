Ninety-three women under 17 were surveyed while still hospitalized following the birth of a child. Each woman was asked questions about substance use (cigarettes, alcohol, marijuna, and other drugs). In addition, questions about the women's family and background were asked as were questions concerning the pregnancy and labor, the perinatal outcome, social support, the use of services, the role of the father of the child, contraceptive use, the timing of events during the pregnancy, and the woman's orientation toward the future. Earlier, intensive interviews had been conducted with forty pregnant adolescents. Although the results of those earlier interviews were not computerized and are not included here, they formed an integral part of the overall study. The hospital survey was developed to validate and elaborate on significant issues which eme\nrged from the intensive, open-ended interviews.
