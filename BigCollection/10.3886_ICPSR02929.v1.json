The result was an end-user application designed to  be run largely by SDNY's nontechnical staff.

The SDNY is the federal prosecuting office for Manhattan and  Bronx counties in New York City, as well as Westchester County and  several other northern counties. The office's primary mission is to  investigate and prosecute federal crimes in these counties. The case  tracking and mapping application was developed for SDNY to move from  the traditionally episodic way of handling cases to a comprehensive  and strategic method. The purpose was to create a system that could  collect case information and link it to specific geographic locations,  and collect information either not handled at all or not handled with  sufficient enough detail by SDNY's existing case management  system. This would give SDNY the ability to cut across agency lines  and establish geographic connections between criminals and federal  cooperators.
