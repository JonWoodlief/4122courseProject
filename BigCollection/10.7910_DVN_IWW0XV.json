These projected increases in health spending may not be a critical situation if\r\nrevenues and productivity of other areas of the economy maintain their historical trends. However,\r\nif revenues do not continue to grow, keeping the share of GDP spent on health constant despite\r\ngrowing demand will certainly affect the quality of and access to health services.\r\nLong-term fiscal projections are an essential component of planning for sustainable expansions of\r\nhealth coverage in Latin America."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-10-01"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Glassman, A. and Ignacio Zoloa, J.
