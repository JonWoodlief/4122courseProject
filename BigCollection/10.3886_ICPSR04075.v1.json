The Third Grade sample consisted of all children who were base year respondents and children who were brought into the sample in spring-first-grade wave through the sample freshening procedure described in section 4.3 of the manual and their families, teachers, and schools. The first-grade data collection targeted base-year respondents, in which a case was considered responding if there was a completed child assessment or parent interview in fall- or spring-kindergarten. While all base-year respondents were eligible for the spring-first-grade data collection, the effort for fall-first-grade was limited to a 30-percent subsample. The spring student sample was freshened to include current first graders who had not been enrolled in kindergarten in 1998-1999 and, therefore, had no chance of being included in the ECLS-K base-year kindergarten sample. For both fall- and spring-first grade, only a subsample of students who had transferred from their kindergarten school was followed. The third-grade data collection targeted base-year respondents and children sampled in first grade through the freshening operation. As in the first-grade data collection, only a subsample of students who had transferred from their kindergarten school was followed. In third grade, however, the subsampling rate applied to transferred children was slightly higher: children whose home language was non-English (also known as children belonging to the language minority group) and who moved for the first time in third grade were followed at 100 percent. In other words, children belonging to the language minority group who did not move in first grade but moved in third grade were all followed into their new third grade schools.

For example, if the analysis uses spring-kindergarten and fall-first grade data, then the appropriate weight would be one that begins with C23 (denoting child-level data from round 2 AND round 3).
