Respondents were asked for their opinions of President Bill  Clinton and his handling of the presidency and foreign affairs, as  well as their views on the United States Congress and the state of the  nation's economy. Those queried were asked which party they intended  to cast their votes for in the congressional elections, which party  they felt was better equipped to handle our nation's problems, and how  likely it was that they would vote in November. Given what respondents  knew about the Monica Lewinsky issue, they were asked for their  opinions on the future of Clinton's second term. They were also asked  for their views on the United States House of Representatives' recent  vote to hold hearings into whether Clinton should be impeached, how  their congressional representative's stance on that issue had  influenced their electoral decisions, and how concerned they were with  Clinton's behavior. Background information on respondents includes  age, sex, race, education, political party, political orientation,\nvoter registration and participation history, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
