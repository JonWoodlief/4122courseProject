A two factorial treatment combination made up of fertilization schemes and sanitary measures were laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates and 10 treatments. Data collected were subjected to a multivariate ANOVA and means separated with the Dunnett t-test with Calliandra calothyrsus considered as the main treatment. Mineral fertilizers and Calliandra calothyrsus significantly augmented stem diameter, plant height and plant vigor, total and marketable yields, despite the fact that late blight severity was high in the two treatments. The correlation matrix showed that total yield had significant and positive correlation with stem diameter (r = 0.74), plant height (r = 0.61), plant vigor (r = 0.61) and marketable yield (r = 0.99) and negative correlation (r = -37) with late blight severity. The increase observed is attributed to the nutrient contents of the treatments applied. Leafy prunings of C. calothyrsus increase soil organic matter which probably improves moisture retention and biological activity. The highest late blight severity recorded between the 45 and 60 coincides with active development of plant canopy which influences disease severity and create a canopy microclimate conducive to disease development. This study suggests that Calliandra calothyrsus has the potential of improving potato production provided appropriate fungicide is used."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-05-14"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Calliandra calothyrsus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Late Blight Severity"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Organic Manure"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Mineral Fertilizers"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Compost"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Takoutsing, B; Asaah, E; Yuh, R; Tchoundjeu, Z; Degrande, A; Kouodiekong, L. 2013.
