The program consisted  of an effort by the probation office, the district attorney's office,  and local advocates for battered women to coordinate prosecution of  offenders and then to effectively supervise them under probation. The  Domestic Abuse Reduction Team (DART), as the program was called, was  formed in 1996 and consisted of a domestic violence case coordinator  in the district attorney's office, a probation officer dedicated to a  domestic violence caseload, a legal advocate from the STOP Domestic  Violence program, and a domestic violence task force coordinator  housed in probation. This study documented the achievements of and  difficulties encountered by the interagency team in a largely rural  county in upstate New York. Such programs are relatively new in the  United States, and very new to rural areas. The focus of this process  evaluation was how the program functioned and the issues it addressed,  rather than outcome measures such as recidivism after  intervention. Data were collected from domestic incident reports  (DIRs) and the district attorney's mainframe database. The DIRs were  mandatory reports filed by police for each domestic violence incident  to which they responded. The district attorney's database contained  information about cases that were prosecuted, such as the name of the  court, the initial charges, and the sentences. Data were gathered from  these case files to describe the demographic characteristics of  victims and offenders and to describe offenses. Part 1 contains data  for all cases in Clinton County that stemmed from a DIR from 1998 to  2000. Part 2 contains a subset of these DIR cases for which there was  an identified male offender and a female intimate partner as a victim  that could be matched to the district attorney's database. This subset  allowed the principal investigators to pinpoint the official domestic  violence cases that were prosecuted. Variables in Parts 1 and 2  consist of the police agency filing the report, the date of the  incident, whether there was an arrest, the sex, race, and birth date  of both the victim and the offender, the relationship of the victim to  the offender, the charges filed, the court in which the case was heard, the pleas offered, and the sentence given."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was a process evaluation of a criminal  justice program responding to intimate partner violence.
