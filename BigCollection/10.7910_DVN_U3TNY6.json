The progress test is a systematic, longitudinal assessment that aims to measure students’ knowledge at the level that they are expected to achieve by the end of their program,  and the questions are based on the Dutch National Blueprint for the Medical Curriculum. The progress test is simultaneously administered 4 times a year to all undergraduate medical students, from the first to the sixth year. At the time of the study, 4 of the 8 medical schools in the Netherlands participated in the progress test. Each progress test consisted of 200 questions, which resulted in a total of 4800 questions. This progress test is particularly suitable because each test contains 200 unique questions developed by a large and diverse group of instructors at different medical schools, it is independent of any curriculum, and it contains both case-based questions and non-case-based questions."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Educational assessment; Educational measurement; Medical education; Progress test; Bloom’s taxonomy"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cho, A Ra"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-01-06"}]}},"files":[{"label":"jeehp-15-28_raw data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":149275,"dataFile":{"id":3337673,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"jeehp-15-28_raw data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":99052,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168265a7589-c82f6eebd4e8","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:nLlJ218wGyEUU/JssqWMrg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e10db3f3ce7d3d8b89fee703396588da","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e10db3f3ce7d3d8b89fee703396588da"}}}]}}}
