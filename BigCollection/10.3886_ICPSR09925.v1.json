Structured interviews were conducted by telephone with police representatives in most of the nation's 50 largest cities and in person with residents and police officers in high drug/crime districts in each of four major cities: Newark, Chicago, El Paso, and Philadelphia. Police department representatives were queried about the usefulness of citizen reports, reasons for citizens' reluctance to make reports, how the rate of citizen reports could be improved, and how citizen reports worked with other community crime prevention strategies. Residents were asked about their tenure in the neighborhood, attitudes toward the quality of life in the neighborhood, major social problems facing the neighborhood, and quality of city services such as police and fire protection, garbage collection, and public health services. Additional questions were asked about the amount of crime in the neighborhood, the amount of drug use and drug-related crime, and the fear of crime. Basic demographic information such as sex, race, and language in which the interview was conducted is also provided."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The American Bar Association Criminal Justice  Section conducted this study to determine how police use reports of  drug-related crimes provided by residents of high-drug crime areas,  and how willing residents of these areas are to make such reports. The  project was designed to take a careful look at citizen reporting of  drug activity. The study attempts to answer three key  questions. First, how important to the police are citizen reports of  drug activity, which types of reports are most useful, and what can be  done on the basis of citizen reports? Second, what is the extent to  which residents of high drug-crime neighborhoods are reluctant to make  reports to the police, and are they more willing to report other types  of crime? Third, what reasons do they give for their reluctance? The  study finds its theoretical basis in the literature available on  bystander intervention in crime, crime reporting by victims, and  community crime prevention. In order to gather the information,  interviews were conducted with the supervisors of police narcotics  units in 46 cities. Interviews were also conducted with 100 residents  of high drug-activity neighborhoods in each of the four cities chosen  for in-depth investigation. Site visits and interviews with other  officials in these cities were also undertaken.

Using a calculated interval based on the total  number of housing units, specific definitions of what a housing unit  consists of, and specific boundaries for each block, housing units in  each block were then systematically listed.
