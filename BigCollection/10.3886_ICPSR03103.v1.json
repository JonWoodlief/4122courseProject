It sought to answer the following questions: (1) What are the challenges facing prosecutors when children are exposed to domestic violence? (2) How are new laws regarding domestic violence committed in the presence of children, now operating in a small number of states, affecting practice? (3) What can prosecutors do to help battered women and their children? To gather data on these topics, the researchers conducted a national telephone survey of prosecutors. Questions asked include case assignment, jurisdiction of the prosecutor's office, caseload, protocol for coordinating cases, asking about domestic violence when investigating child abuse cases, asking about children when investigating domestic violence cases, and how the respondent found out when a child abuse case involved domestic violence or when a domestic violence case involved children. Other variables cover whether police routinely checked for prior Child Protective Services (CPS) reports, if these cases were heard by the same judge, in the same court, and were handled by the same prosecutor, if there were laws identifying exposure to domestic violence as child abuse, if there were laws applying or enhancing criminal penalties when children were exposed to domestic violence, if the state legislature was considering any such action, if prosecutors were using other avenues to enhance penalties, if there was pertinent caselaw, and if the respondent's office had a no-drop policy for domestic violence cases. Additional items focus on whether the presence of children influenced decisions to prosecute, if the office would report or prosecute a battered woman who abused her children, or failed to protect her children from abuse or from exposure to domestic violence, how often the office prosecuted such women, if there was a batterers' treatment program in the community, how often batterers were sentenced to attend the treatment program, if there were programs to which the respondent could refer battered mothers and children, what types of programs were operating, and if prosecutors had received training on domestic violence issues."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Violence against women and violence against  children are not isolated phenomena. Rather, such violence often  co-exists in families. Children who grow up in violent homes suffer a  wide range of adverse behavioral and psychological effects, including  a tendency to repeat abusive behaviors, as perpetrators and as  victims, when they attain adulthood. Increased awareness of the  adverse effects of domestic\nviolence on children has prompted some  states to enact laws either creating a new offense, or imposing new  sanctions, for cases in which domestic violence is committed in the  presence of children. It is the prosecutor's job to enforce these new  laws, as well as other existing laws that might be relevant. In their  efforts to enforce the law while balancing the interests of women and  children, prosecutors across the country have found themselves caught  in the midst of a debate over how best to protect children in the  context of domestic violence. This study aimed to describe current  practice and to identify \"promising practices\" in the response to  cases involving domestic violence and child victims or witnesses. It  sought to answer the following questions: (1) What are the challenges  facing prosecutors when children are exposed to domestic violence?

In consultation with attorneys from  the National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse, the decision was  made to survey two prosecutors' offices in each state, for a total of  100 respondent jurisdictions. The reasoning was that the statutory  framework was a key consideration when examining prosecutorial  decision-making. Depending upon the structure of each prosecutor's  office, it was possible to interview either a single individual with  responsibility for all family violence cases (whether as head of a  Family Violence Unit or as an individual attorney with this particular  assignment), or two prosecutors, one with responsibility for domestic  violence cases and the other with responsibility for child abuse  cases. For purposes of analysis, in jurisdictions where two  prosecutors were interviewed, the two responses were combined, so that  the unit of analysis remains the jurisdiction and not the individual attorney."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Questions asked include case assignment,  jurisdiction Cof the prosecutor's office, caseload, protocol for  coordinating cases, asking about domestic violence when investigating  child abuse cases, asking about children when investigating  domestic violence cases, and how the respondent found out when a child  abuse case involved domestic violence or when a domestic violence case  involved children.
