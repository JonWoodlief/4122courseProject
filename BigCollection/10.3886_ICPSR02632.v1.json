To develop the Proposed Iowa Juvenile Court Intake Risk Assessment, a team of juvenile court representatives from all eight judicial districts in Iowa, consisting of juvenile court officers, intake officers, and supervisors, designed a risk assessment test instrument to assess a group of juveniles at intake during a one-month period between October and November 1994. The follow-up data collection was conducted by chief juvenile court officers eight months after the original data collection. The purpose of the follow-up was to gather data regarding reoffending. Risk assessment variables include types and number of current offenses, prior arrests and adjudication, histories of supervision and service, substance use and abuse, runaway occurrences, peer relationships, gang affiliation, attitude during intake interview, level of parental control, schooling status (dropped out, graduated, truant), type of current school, discipline problems, suspensions at school, current employment, history of family problems, and reoffending.

The Iowa Division of  Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning (CJJP), Iowa Department of  Human Rights, was mandated to conduct long-range planning for the  criminal and juvenile justice systems, to study pertinent issues, and  to provide technical assistance to jurisdictions in their planning and  research endeavors. In 1993, CJJP received federal funds through the  National Institute of Justice to improve Iowa's capacity to conduct  criminal and juvenile justice evaluations. In investigating ways in  which this special funding could be put to use, CJJP met with the  chief juvenile court officers to discuss their needs. The chief  juvenile court officers expressed interest in the development of a  risk assessment instrument for use by the juvenile court at the time  of intake. It was anticipated that the risk assessment instrument  would be useful not only in providing the juvenile court officers with  a tool to appropriately assess the risk of recidivism, but also in  providing \"common ground\" to treatment staff and other relevant  officials to determine whether certain interventions worked better  with certain levels of risk than others, and whether limited resources  were being appropriately utilized in providing appropriate interventions to juveniles with specific risk scores."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To develop the Proposed Iowa Juvenile Court Intake  Risk Assessment, a team of juvenile court representatives from all  eight judicial districts in Iowa, consisting of juvenile court  officers, intake officers, and supervisors, designed the risk  assessment test instrument to assess a group of juveniles at intake  during a one-month period between October and November 1994.
