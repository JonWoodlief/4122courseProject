Our main concern is with examining whether the consistent pattern found by these authors of segmentation in the placement market, with a small set of schools forming a relatively self-enclosed elite, but with a wide circulation of their Ph.D.s throughout the discipline, continued to hold during the last four decades of the 20th century.  We find that it did.  While we see an expansion over the course of the 20th century of Ph.D. production from a handful of schools to a set of 132 Ph.D. producing institutions, with a decreasing inequality in concentration of Ph.D. production as exhibited in Lorenz curves, an elite set of schools, drawing faculty mostly from themselves and each other, still play a unique role in shaping the teaching of Ph.D.s in the discipline."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Natalie Masuoka, Bernard Grofman and Scott Feld. \"Production and Placement of Ph.D.s: 1902-2000\" (forthcoming in PS: Political Science and Politics April, 2007). <a href=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bgrofman/MASUOKA%20Prod%20Placement%20for%20Bernie%20web.pdf\" target= \"_new\"> article available here </a>"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bernie Grofman"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bgrofman/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-07"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1960"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2000"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data file for this study","label":"MASUOKA-Production and Placement_R&R_FINAL_additional tables for website1.doc","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61444,"categories":["1.
