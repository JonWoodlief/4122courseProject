The study also aimed to evaluate whether the outcomes of the demonstration project had application for other tribal communities confronting similar public safety issues related to substance abuse. Qualitative information from focus group interviews was collected. Six focus groups were held with individuals representing the following populations: service providers, policy makers, adult clients and family members, youth, traditional tribal healers, and community members. In addition to the focus groups, the evaluation team conducted an interview session with two traditional providers who preferred this format. All focus groups were conducted on-site at Lummi by two trained moderators from the evaluation team. There were six different sets of questions, one for each group. Each set included 9 to 10 open-ended questions, which addressed knowledge and impact of the Community Mobilized Against Drugs (CMAD) Initiative; issues or problems with the Initiative; how the community viewed its actions; the importance and inclusion of a cultural perspective (traditional healers and others) in implementing various aspects of the CMAD Initiative; and how the Initiative had affected work and networking capabilities, policy making decisions, and/or treatment. Participants were also asked to think about what they would like CMAD to address and about their perceptions and definitions of some of the service barriers they may be experiencing (clients, community, and/or youth).

The focus groups occurred in surroundings that ensured privacy and confidentiality. All consenting processes occurred just prior to the start of the groups except for the youth group session, in which all participants were required to come with signed parental/participant consent forms. Participants were handed copies of the focus group questions to refer to throughout the process. There were six different sets of questions, one for each group. Each set included 9 to 10 questions. All questions followed the format from general to specific and reflected an open-ended approach that encouraged discussion. These questions were reviewed by each member of Evaluation Oversight Committee (EOC), individually and as part of the group. All the focus groups were openly audio taped with full knowledge and agreement of the participants. In addition to taping, the moderators took notes throughout the session. The focus groups took from 90 to 120 minutes to conduct, depending on the length and time participants took to discuss the questions. In addition to focus groups, the evaluation team conducted an interview session with two traditional providers who preferred this format. These two individuals were interviewed together using the same questions employed in the focus group for traditional healers. All participants were provided with snacks and were compensated for their time and effort. Because the service providers and policy makers were paid employees of the Lummi Nation, they received prints of paintings done by Northwest Indian artists.

These designated individuals took on the responsibility of contacting the individuals. This same method was used to compile and recruit participants to the adult client group.
