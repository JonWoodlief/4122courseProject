The study only accounted for slightly more than half of all fatalities attributed to acts of terrorism between 1998 and 2005. The other significant number of fatalities are acts that went unclaimed, either by terrorist organizations in the database, unknown terrorist entities, or terrorists entities not classified as organizations by the database and therefore would not be part of the study. Also some organizations may have been excluded because they were deemed religious in nature. This would mean the findings on religion and lethality are understated. Finally, of the 499 organizations that committed an act, MIPT had no information or information that could be duplicative on 104 of the organizations, leaving the possibility of inaccurate data.;"},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Project on Violent
