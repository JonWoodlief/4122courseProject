The study, conducted in  1992-1993, was designed to provide information on what was occurring  and what needed to occur in the development and implementation of  community policing. The study sought to determine how community  policing was operationally defined and how it differed from  traditional forms of policing. In 1997, ORC Macro International, Inc.,  and the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) conducted a  longitudinal follow-up to the previous survey. The 1997 study was  designed to provide information on the most current practices and  trends in community policing. The survey was based on the survey  administered by the Police Foundation in 1992-1993. Parts 1 and 2 of  this data collection consist of the quantitative responses by chief  executives and police agencies, respectively, to the 1997 survey  administered to a nationally representative sample of police  agencies. The same survey instrument was also administered to a second  sample of chief executives (Part 3) and police agencies (Part 4) that  received at least one grant from the Community Oriented Policing  Service (COPS) office of the United States Department of Justice. This  second sample was designed to supplement the first sample in order to  adequately represent police agencies that were involved in community  policing. Part 5 consists of the police agency survey data gathered by  the Police Foundation in 1992-1993 and reanalyzed by the principal  investigators of this study. Part 6 contains the qualitative  open-ended responses to questions selected from the 1997 Police Agency  Survey (Part 2). Variables in Parts 1 and 3 include whether the top  executive was elected or appointed, whether the executive mandated  community policing, executive opinions about community policing, the  impact of community policing, who should be responsible for conducting  community policing, and what influenced the decision to implement  community policing. Information is also available on the type of  agency represented in the survey and its regional location. Parts 2,  4, and 5 include information about the types of resources that  agencies utilized in their approach to law enforcement, organizational  programs and practices, the agencies' current situation with respect  to community policing, when community policing was implemented, types  of administrative policies that had been implemented with respect to  community policing, types of training officers received, written  policies concerning police interactions with government agencies and  citizens, new legislation passed to support community policing, the  effects of community policing, types of organizational arrangements in  place, specific duties of patrol officers, special units, and civilian  personnel, specific responsibilities of captains, lieutenants, and  sergeants, types of citizen participation in community policing,  numbers of various types of personnel, population of jurisdiction, and  type of jurisdiction served. In addition, Parts 2 and 4 contain crime  rates for police jurisdictions for murder, rape, robbery, assault,  burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Part 6 contains open-ended  responses from the 1997 Police Agency Survey (Part 2) to questions  about resources used in the agency's approach to law enforcement,  specific types of officer training, specific written policies  concerning community policing, lessons learned in the process of  making changes in policies or practices, and additional comments to the survey."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"An increasing number of police and sheriffs'  departments have implemented formal community policing procedures in  an effort to improve public safety and the overall quality of life in  their communities.

The survey  was based on the survey administered by the Police Foundation in  1992-1993. The major changes made to the instrument were: (1) it was  modified to capture data regarding civilian personnel, (2) it was  redesigned to focus on existing strategies, with less emphasis on  planned approaches, (3) it was modified to include a comprehensive  section on officer training, and (4) it was designed in a more  user-friendly format. Topics covered on the survey included: (1)  executive views, (2) organizational programs and practices, (3)  organization's experience with community policing, (4) organizational  arrangements, (5) patrol officer, deputy, and civilian personnel  responsibilities, (6) authority and responsibility of managers and  supervisors of field operations, (7) citizen participation, (8)  organizational characteristics, and (9) other approaches. To maximize  response rates and minimize nonresponse bias, the survey employed a  multi-phase approach, which included using the United States Postal  Service, facsimile transmissions, and telephone contacts. Completed  surveys were scanned via optical-character- recognition  technology. Quality control measures were instituted to ensure that  the scanned data file matched the questionnaire completed by each  respondent. Surveys were also checked to ensure logical  consistency.
