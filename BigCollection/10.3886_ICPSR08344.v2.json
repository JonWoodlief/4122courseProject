The  first longitudinal study to concentrate on the process of retirement  and to include change over a period of time as an object of study, the  six surveys in the Retirement History Longitudinal Survey (RHLS) aimed  at learning in detail the connections between worklife characteristics,  retirement timing, and the determinants of style, quality, and conduct  of retirement. With the 1969 study as a baseline, this study, along with  subsequent biennial studies since 1969, record the retirement process as   it developed. To provide information on pre-retirement lives and   attitudes of respondents, questions were asked regarding labor force   history, retirement and retirement plans, health, household, family and   social activities, income, assets, and debts for respondents and their   spouses. Detailed information is provided on the sources and size of   income and assets, as well as debts. Questions also focussed on retirement   patterns and determinants of retirement timing, especially the relationship  between pre-retirement income and expected post-retirement income. Also   examined was the influence exerted by health, anticipated post-retirement   needs and resources, employer policies, and significant work history.   Labor force questions covered the respondents' occupation and attitude  toward that occupation, number of hours worked, salary, unemployment,  and job-seeking behavior. Information on retirement plans included  whether and when the respondents planned to retire, reasons for  retirement, whether they had made retirement plans, such as moving  residences or working, expected expenses and resources, and subjective   attitudes toward retirement. Respondents who were already partially or   fully retired were asked to report retrospectively on retirement age,   reasons for retirement, and whether they had planned for retirement   prior to actually retiring. Questions on health experience pertained   to the calendar year prior to the interview, and included  receipts and costs of physical examinations and dentist visits,  hospitalization, prescription and non-prescription medicines,  other medical supplies and services, health insurance coverage and  other resources for payment of medical expenses, and a measure of the  respondent's own physical health. Questions were also asked concerning  leisure activities, socialization, proximity and frequency of contact   with close relatives, and receipt of financial support from relatives.  Information on food and housing, property ownership, and transportation  was also gathered to provide a measure of changes in retirement  lifestyle. Demographic items specify race, sex, age, marital  status, education, income, benefits amount, assets, debts, number  of children and children attending school, and household composition  and relationship. Of the 7,352 cases contained in the data file,  1,082 cases represent interviews with surviving spouses of the  original respondents who died after the initial 1969 survey."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"older workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personal finances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement adjustment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement planning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.D.
