A complete,   detailed inventory of household assets and debts including businesses,   pensions, properties, and financial transactions was collected along   with demographic data and a comprehensive work history for primary   family members. In addition to recording data on the economic assets   and liabilities of 4,103 families, the survey examined the attitudes of   consumers toward credit use, their reactions to new financial   instruments and to consumer credit regulations, and their knowledge of   consumer pension rights and benefits. Data on reasons for various   financial choices and attitudes toward financial risk and liquidity   were also collected. Information that permits estimation of pension and   Social Security wealth was gathered as well. Data for this collection   exist in two versions: raw data prepared by the University of   Michigan's Survey Research Center and recoded data, prepared by the   Federal Reserve Board. The latter file was produced by the Federal   Reserve Board using a series of consistency checks and imputation   procedures to edit the raw data and estimate values for missing data.   Additional weights were constructed and included in the recoded data   file. New variables were also constructed directly from original   variables and, in addition, were created by matching information from  other sources such as the U.S. Census."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer protection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"credit"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"debt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial assets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household budgets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"loans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.A.

A special procedure utilizing the office of the Comptroller of   the Currency was used to ensure the anonymity of the respondents. The   total sample consisted of 4,262 household respondents.
