The resulting revised Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS-R) included the original eight yes/no items on the BJMHS and four additional yes/no questions that were added to try to improve the accuracy of the BJMHS: three pertaining to depression and one relating to post-traumatic stress.</p>\n\n<p>Participants in the study included male and female jail detainees admitted to one of four county jails, two in Maryland (Montgomery County, MD, and Prince George County, MD) and two in New York (Rennselaer County, NY, and Monroe County, NY), from November 2005 to June 2006. A total of 10,562 jail detainees were screened using the BJMHS-R (Part 1), which generally occured within 24 hours after their initial booking. The screening data were used to identify a sub-sample of detainees who were systematically sampled for a detailed clinical assessment, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), which was conducted by a trained research interviewer in order to validate the screen. The SCID is a semi-structured interview designed to asses\ns the presence of selected DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses. Detainees were considered to be referred for further evaluation if they endorsed at least two of the ten symptoms or either of the two medical history questions of the BJMHS-R. This sub-sample was constructed so that there would be an adequate sample of inmates from each jail who scored positive on the BJMHS-R, and was designed to comprise a large number of females to enable separate analysis by gender.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as detainees were classified into the referral and non-referral groups, a Subject Tracking Program, programmed in MS Access, was used to identify and generate a list of potential detainee participants for the SCID interview. This list of potential participants was given to jail administration staff who verified each detainee's presence in the jail and who helped schedule consultation visits between the detainees and the study's trained Clinical Research Interviewers. The Clinical Research Interviewers, who were blind to the detainees' sampling group statuses, approached the detainees on their list of potential participants and completed SCID interviews with those who consented to participate in the study. A subset of 464 jail detainees completed the SCID interviews (Part 2), which were conducted within 72 hours of a detainee's admission to the jail. Participation in this study was voluntary. Informed consent forms were required and obtained for all Structured Clinical Interview for DMM-IV (SCID) interview participants. Participants were informed that their decision to participate would not affect their stay in the jail and were administered a brief quiz to assess their competency to consent.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>Part 1, Tracking Data, contains 54 variables, including items and scores from the revised Brief Jail Mental Health Screen (BJMHS-R), that were used to used to identify and generate a list of potential detainee participants for the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) interview.
