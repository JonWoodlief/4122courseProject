The response format was a five-point Likert-type scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree, or don't know). The only open-ended survey question captured respondent policy recommendations. Respondents logged on to the survey using a unique \"username\" and private password assigned by the Urban Institute; online instructions reminded respondents that participation was voluntary and completely confidential.
