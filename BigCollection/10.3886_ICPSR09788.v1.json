The premise of this  theory is that the rate of occurrence of crime is affected by the  convergence in time and space of three elements: motivated offenders,  suitable targets, and the absence of guardianship against crime. The  purpose of this study was to provide empirical evidence for the routine  activities theory by investigating criminal data on places. This study  deviates from traditional criminology research by analyzing places  instead of collectivities as units of spatial analysis. There are two  phases to this study. The purpose of the first phase was to test  whether crime occurs randomly in space or is concentrated in \"hot  spots\". Telephone calls for police service made in 1985 and 1986 to  the Minneapolis Police Department were analyzed for patterns and  concentration of repeat calls and were statistically tested for  randomness. For the second phase of the study, two field experiments  were designed to test the effectiveness of a proactive police strategy  called Repeat Complaint Address Policing (RECAP). Samples of  residential and commercial addresses that generated the most  concentrated and most frequent repeat calls were divided into groups of  experimental and control addresses, resulting in matched pairs. The  experimental addresses were then subjected to a more focused proactive  policing. The purposes of the RECAP experimentation were to test the  effectiveness of proactive police strategy, as measured through the  reduction in the incidence of calls to the police and, in so doing, to  provide empirical evidence on the routine activities theory. Variables  in this collection include the number of calls for police service in  both 1986 and 1987 to the control addresses for each experimental pair,  the number of calls for police service in both 1986 and 1987 to the  experimental addresses for each experimental pair, numerical  differences between calls in 1987 and 1986 for both the control  addresses and experimental addresses in each experimental pair,  percentage difference between calls in 1987 and 1986 for both the  control addresses and the experimental addresses in each experimental  pair, and a variable that indicates whether the experimental  pair was used in the experimental analysis. The unit of observation for  the first phase of the study is the recorded telephone call to the  Minneapolis Police Department for police service and assistance. The  unit of analysis for the second phase is the matched pair of control  and experimental addresses for both the residential and commercial address samples of the RECAP experiments."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"causes of crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen crime reporting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime patterns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police reports"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
