Unlike previous years, the data are presented in eight separate  parts: Part 1, Work Done Record (Replacement or Additions to the  House), Part 2, Worker Record, Part 3, Mortgages (Owners Only), Part  4, Housing Unit Record (Main Record), Recodes (One Record per Housing  Unit), and Weights, Part 5, Manager and Owner Record (Renters Only),  Part 6, Person Record, Part 7, Ratio Verification, and Part 8, Mover  Group Record. Data include year the structure was built, type and  number of living quarters, occupancy status, access, number of rooms,  presence of commercial establishments on the property, and property  value. Additional data focus on kitchen and plumbing facilities, types  of heating fuel used, source of water, sewage disposal, heating and  air-conditioning equipment, and major additions, alterations, or  repairs to the property. Information provided on housing expenses  includes monthly mortgage or rent payments, cost of services such as  utilities, garbage collection, and property insurance, and amount of  real estate taxes paid in the previous year. Also included is  information on whether the household received government assistance to  help pay heating or cooling costs or for other energy-related  services. Similar data are provided for housing units previously  occupied by respondents who had recently moved. Additionally,  indicators of housing and neighborhood quality are supplied. Housing  quality variables include privacy of bedrooms, condition of kitchen  facilities, basement or roof leakage, breakdowns of plumbing  facilities and equipment, and overall opinion of the structure. For  quality of neighborhood, variables include use of exterminator  services, existence of boarded-up buildings, and overall quality of  the neighborhood. In addition to housing characteristics, some  demographic data are provided on household members, such as age, sex,  race, marital status, income, and relationship to householder.  Additional data provided on the householder include years of school  completed, Spanish origin, length of residence, and length of occupancy."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"commuting

All  interviews are conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing  (CAPI) software, allowing new responses to some questions. Rather than  existing as a single file, this collection consists of eight parts,  each containing data pertaining to a specific subject matter. In  addition, data for building and neighborhood questions ceased to be  collected through interviewer observation. Rather, these questions  have been reworded for the respondents. Due to these changes, users  are asked to use caution when comparing data prior to 1997 with data  from 1997 forward. For further information about the redesign, please  refer to DOCUMENTATION OF CHANGES IN THE 1997 AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY  included with AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY, 1997: NATIONAL MICRODATA  (ICPSR 2912). (2) Beginning with 2001, three datasets, Part 2,  Housing Unit Record (Main Record), Part 9, Recodes (One Record per  Housing Unit), and Part 10, Weights, have been combined into one  dataset: Part 4, Housing Unit Record (Main Record), Recodes (One  Record per Housing Unit), and Weights.

The same basic  sample of housing units is interviewed every two years until a new  sample is selected. The United States Census Bureau updated the sample  by adding newly constructed housing units and units discovered through  coverage improvement efforts. For the 2003 American Housing Survey  National (AHS-N), approximately 63,300 sample housing units were  selected for interview. About 2,250 of these units were found to be  ineligible because the unit no longer existed or because the units did  not meet the AHS-N definition of a housing unit. Of the 61,050  eligible sample units, about 5,650 were classified (both occupied and  vacant housing units) as \"Type A\" noninterviews because (a) no one was  at home after repeated visits, (b) the respondent refused to be  interviewed, or (c) the interviewer was unable to find the unit. This  classification produced an unweighted overall response rate of 91  percent. The weighted overall response rate was 92 percent. The AHS  sample consists of the following types of units in the sampled primary  sampling units: housing units selected from the 1980 Census, new  construction in areas requiring building permits, housing units missed  in the 1980 Census, and other housing units added since the 1980  Census.
