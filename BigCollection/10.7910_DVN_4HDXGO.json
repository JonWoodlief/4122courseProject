Questions concerned Village Identification, Institutional Identification, Background of Respondents, Identification of Activities, Foundation, Members/Clients of the Institution, Internal Savings, Internal Lending, Extended Repayment of Loans and Default, Internal Structure of the Institution, Income Generation Activities Owned by the Institution, Current Relationship with Other Financial Institution Outside the Village, Free Aid were collected.\r\n<br /><br />  Area selection: <br /><br />  The survey picks 16 communities in municipal areas of each amphoe under the ongoing Townsend’s project (Rural Survey). However, the numbers of communities in each amphoe vary between 1 to 18 communities; the Muang district has the largest number of communities, while other municipalities have no more than 4 communities. In order to cover the majority of both areas and community, the survey chooses 10 communities in Muang district and additional 2 commu\r\nnities in other municipal areas in 3 amphoes in each province, totaling 96 communities. The choices of amphoes for urban survey are as follow:\r\n<br /><br />  1. Chachoengsao includes Muang district and 3 amphoes, namely Bangpakong, Bangkla and Phanomsarakam. Amphoe Bang Nam Priao and Amphoe Sanamchai have only 1 community and 2 villages that are semi-urban. In addition, there are villages included in the Townsend Rural Survey. Amphoe Khao Takiab is excluded for the reason that there is no muinicipality. <br /><br /> 2. Lop Buri the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Ban Mee, Chaibadan and Koksamrong. <br /><br /> 3. Buriram the survey covers A\r\nmphoe Muang, Prakonchai, Satuk and Nangrong <br /><br /> 4. Sisaket the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Kanthararom, Kanthonlak and Uthumpornpisai. Amphoe Prangkoo is excluded for the reason that it has only 1 community. Amphoe Posrisuwan is excluded for the reason that there is no municipality. <br /><br /> 5. Satun the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Langu, Tapae and Kuandon. <br /><br /> 6. Phrae the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Denchai, Rongkwang and Sungman. <br /><br />  Sample Selection: <br /><br\r\n/>  15 Household are selected from each community for interview. Due to time constraint, the survey decided to use the list of community fund’s member who applied for village/community fund from Government Housing Bank and Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives. Each community fund must have members who are residents of that community no less than 95% of total household in the community. Each member is assigned a number and will be randomly selected. There\r\nare 1440 households (240 for each province) in total. The community heads (in the selected sample) are also interviewed; totaling 96 communities. For institutional survey, it is required prior to the community selection that such community must have village/community fund in operation. The village fund committees are interviewed by using Household Questionnaire Initial Survey. The survey includes 96 communities’ funds, saving groups, other group and 26 institutions/organizations of ROSCA.\r\n<br /><br />"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[]}},"files":[{"description":"About CaseID","label":"About-NEWID.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":84836,"categories":["1.
