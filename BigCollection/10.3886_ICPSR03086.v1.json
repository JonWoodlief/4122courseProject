The researchers sought to demonstrate that two important  social and health problems, domestic violence and trauma-related  psychological distress, were connected. The project was organized  into four studies, each of which addressed a specific objective: (1)  Variables characterizing the perpetrator's family of procreation were  used to determine the pattern of relationships among marital and  family functioning, perpetrator-to-partner violence, partner's mental  distress, and child behavior problems. (2) The perpetrator's early  background and trauma history were studied to establish the degree to  which the perpetrator's family of origin characteristics and  experiences, childhood antisocial behavior, exposure to stressors in  the Vietnam war zone, and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) symptomatology related to perpetrator-to-partner family  violence. (3) The perpetrator's degree of mental distress was  examined to ascertain the ways in which the current mental distress  of the perpetrator was associated with marital and family  functioning, violence, and current mental distress of the  partner. (4) Developmental and intergenerational perspectives on  violence were used to model a network of relationships explaining the  potential transmission of violence across generations, commencing  with the perpetrator's accounts of violence within the family of  origin and terminating with reports of child behavior problems within  the family of procreation. Data for this study came from the  congressionally-mandated National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study  (NVVRS) (Kulka et al., 1990), which sought to document the current  and long-term psychological status of those who served one or more  tours of duty in the Vietnam theater of operations sometime between  August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975, compared to their peers who served  elsewhere in the military during that era and to a comparable group  who never experienced military service. This study relied upon data  from the National Survey and Family Interview components of t\nhe  larger NVVRS. Data were collected through face-to-face structured  interviews, with some supplementary self-report paper-and-pencil  measures. The interview protocol was organized into 16 parts,  including portions requesting information on childhood experiences  and early delinquent behaviors, military service history, legal  problems in the family of origin and postwar period, stressful life  events, social support systems, marital and family discord and  abusive behaviors, and physical and mental health. This study  emphasized four categories of explanatory variables: (1) the  perpetrator's accounts of family of origin characteristics and  experiences, (2) the perpetrator's conduct and behavior problems  prior to age 15, (3) the perpetrator's exposure to war-zone  stressors, and (4) mental distress of the perpetrator, with attention  to PTSD symptomatology and alcohol abuse. Additionally, the project  incorporated four clusters of family of procreation criterion  variables: (1) marital and family functioning, (2) perpetrator-to-  partner violence, (3) partner mental distress, and (4) child behavior  problems. Variables include child abuse, family histories of  substance abuse, criminal activity, or mental health problems,  relationship as a child with parents, misbehavior as a child, combat  experience, fear for personal safety during combat, alcohol use and  abuse, emotional well-being including stress, guilt, relationships  with others, panic, and loneliness, acts of physical and verbal  violence toward partner, children's emotional and behavioral  problems, problem-solving, decision-making, and communication in family, and family support."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The goal of this project was to gain a better  understanding of risk factors associated with male-perpetrated  domestic violence, partner's mental distress, and child behavior  problems using data from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment  Study (NVVRS) (Kulka et al., 1990).

Additionally, the principal investigators created several  scales as the key measures in this study. Perpetrator's family of  origin characteristics and experiences were operationalized by a  scale summarizing relationship with mother and relationship with  father, as well as by an index of family dysfunction consisting of  four scales measuring family turmoil, severe punishment,  interparental violence, and an inventory of traumatic events. The  perpetrator's childhood antisocial behavior was operationalized with  a five-parcel scale based on items from the Diagnostic Interview  Schedule (Robins, Helzer, Croughan, and Ratcliff, 1981). The  perpetrator's exposure to war-zone stressors was measured with two  scales capturing exposure to traditional combat and perceived threat  regarding personal safety. Perpetrator's current mental distress was  assessed using four scales from the Mississippi Scale for  Combat-Related PTSD (Keane et al., 1988). Additionally four scales  for alcohol abuse were created using the Diagnostic Interview  Schedule (Robins et al., 1981) and the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, American Psychological  Association, 1994). Partner's mental distress was measured with  scales for general well-being, social isolation, and a scale of  demoralization based on the Psychiatric Epidemiological Research  Interview (Dohrenwend, 1982). Perpetrator-to-partner violence was  based on the Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus, 1979 and 1990). Marital  and family functioning was operationalized with a scale of marital  adjustment based on Spanier's (1976) Dyadic Adjustment Scale,  Dohrenwend's (1982) Marital Dissatisfaction Scale from the  Psychiatric Epidemiological Research Interview, and instruments used  in national studies of American life conducted by Campbell, Converse,  and Rodgers (1976) and Veroff, Dowan, and Kulka (1981). Family  adaptability and cohesion variables were taken from the Family  Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACESII, Olson, Bell,  and Porter, 1978, Olson, McCubbin, Barnes, Larsen, Muxen, and Wilson,  1983). Child behavior problems were measured with two s\ncales,  internalizing and externalizing, based on the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenback, 1978 and 1991)."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Risk Factors for Male-Perpetrated Domestic Violence in Vietnam Veteran Families in the United States, 1988 ","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41832,"dataFile":{"id":2662690,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Risk Factors for Male-Perpetrated Domestic Violence in Vietnam Veteran Families in the United States, 1988 ","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
