A primary goal of the study was to create an empirical  database from which criminological theories and governmental policies  could be effectively evaluated. The American Terrorism Study began in  1989 when the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Terrorist  Research and Analytical Center released a list of persons indicted as  a result of investigation under the FBI's Counterterrorism  Program. Since that time, FBI has released additional lists to the  principal investigators. After receiving a list of persons indicted  in federal criminal court as a result of an official terrorism  investigation, the researchers reviewed the cases at either the  federal district court where the cases were tried or at the federal  regional records center where the cases were archived. The researchers  divided the dataset into five distinct datasets. Part 1, Counts Data,  provides data on every count for each indictee in each indictment.  This is the basic dataset. There were 7,306 counts from 1980 to  2002. Part 2, Indictees Data, provides data on each of the 574  indictees from 1980-2002.

A primary goal of the American Terrorism Study was to  create an empirical database from which criminological theories and  governmental policies could be effectively evaluated. In addition to  this goal, the study had three objectives: (1) to examine the  characteristics, patterns of behavior, and tactics of American  terrorist groups in the post-guidelines era to determine if terrorist  groups have been modifying their tactics in response to prosecutorial  success, (2) to assess the impact of potential changes in the first  objective on prosecutorial and sanctioning strategies employed during  the post-guidelines era and to determine the types of evidence and  charges most likely to lead to successful prosecution of terrorism  cases, and (3) to determine whether the introduction of federal  sentencing guidelines have reduced the sentence disparity between terrorists and similarly situated non-terrorists."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The American Terrorism Study began in 1989 when  the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Terrorist Research and  Analytical Center released a list of persons indicted as a result of  investigation under the FBI's Counterterrorism Program. Since that  time the FBI has released additional lists to the principal  investigators. Because the FBI released these lists to the principal  investigators, the American Terrorism study strictly adheres to the  FBI's definition of terrorism, which is: \"the unlawful use of force or\nviolence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a  government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in  furtherance of political or social objectives\" (see TERRORISM IN THE  UNITED STATES, Washington, DC: US. Government Printing Office,  1997). Furthermore, the study ensures adherence to the practical  application of the definition by restricting itself to data collection  only, on cases that occurred as a result of an indictment stemming  from a federal \"domestic security/terrorism investigation.\" After  receiving a list of persons indicted in federal criminal court as a  result of an official terrorism investigation, the researchers  reviewed the cases at either the federal district court where the  cases were tried or at the federal regional records center where the  cases were archived. The researchers divided the data collection into  five distinct datasets. Part 1, Counts Data, provides data on every  count for each indictee in each indictment. There were 7,306 counts  from 1980 to 2002. This is the basic dataset, and it is the one that  should be used to conduct count-based analyses. Part 2, Indictees  Data, provides data on each of the 574 indictees from 1980 to  2002. This is the dataset to use to analyze the outcomes for  individuals indicted for an act of terrorism in the United  States. Part 3, Persons Data, provides data on the 510 individuals who  were indicted by the federal government as a result of a terrorism  investigation. This would be the appropriate dataset to use for  demographic analyses. Part 4, Cases Data, provides one line of data  for each of the 172 criminal terrorism cases that resulted from a  federal terrorism investigation. Part 5, Group Data, provides one  line of case data for each of the 85 groups that were tried in federal  court for terrorism-related activity. The \"common denominator\" for all  cases in the sample is the count. All subsequent data on individuals,  terrorist group affiliations, prosecution/defense strategies, and  sentencing are replicated for each count.
