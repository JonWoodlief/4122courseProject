Respondents were asked to give   their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the   presidency, the economy, foreign affairs, and crime. Respondents were   polled on the most important problem facing the country, whether they   approved or disapproved of the way Speaker of the House Newt   Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and the United States   Congress were doing their jobs, whether President Clinton or the   Republicans in Congress would do a better job handling the country's   problems, and whether each was seeking the right or wrong changes for   the country. Opinions were solicited on whether the Republicans in   Congress had begun to gridlock Washington, whether they kept most of   their campaign promises, whether they proposed too many, too little,   or the right amount of program cuts, and whether respondents   supported or opposed most of their \"Contract with America.\" A series   of questions addressed the condition of the national economy, whether   the federal budget could be balanced without raising taxes or cutting   spending on Social Security and the military, and whether it was more   important to pass a balanced budget amendment or to protect Social   Security, maintain military spending, or hold down taxes. Respondents   were asked whether they would vote for President Clinton or a   Republican nominee in the 1996 presidential election, who the   Republican and Democratic parties should nominate for president, and   whether respondents held favorable or unfavorable views of Newt   Gingrich, Bob Dole, Vice-President Al Gore, Senator Phil Gramm,   former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, Republican   presidential nominee Lamar Alexander, and California Governor Pete   Wilson. Opinions were also solicited on whether respondents had more   trust in their federal, state, or local government to handle issues   such as fighting crime, setting environmental regulations,   establishing welfare rules, and protecting civil rights, and whether   they supported or opposed term limits for United States   Representatives, as well as laws discouraging frivolous lawsuits.   Questions regarding affirmative action addressed whether women and   minorities should receive preference in hiring and college admissions   to make up for past discrimination, whether affirmative action   programs increased opportunities for these groups, and whether they   should be continued, changed, or eliminated. Respondents were also   asked whether these programs resulted in fewer opportunities for   White men, whether this would be justified, whether the respondent or   a family member felt they had been denied a job because of their race   or sex, and whether it made them angry. Additional questions asked   how closely respondents followed the O.J. Simpson trial, whether he   was getting a fair trial, and whether he was guilty or innocent.   Background variables include age, sex, ethnicity, education,   religion, employment status, household income, political orientation,   politica\nl party affiliation, subjective size of community, social   class, number and sex of children, labor union membership, whether   the respondent was registered to vote, whether he or she voted in the  1992 presidential election, and if so, for whom."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Affirmative Action"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alexander, Lamar"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"balanced budget"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Dole, Bob"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"federal budget"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gingrich, Newt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gore, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gramm, Phil"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Powell, Colin"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential election"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Simpson, O.J."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
