This collection was based on the research of Samuel Eldersveld of the University of Michigan, Ahmed Bashiruddin of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi, and Dwaine Marvick of the University of California-Los Angeles. The focus of these surveys was on the perceptions, attitudes, and behavior of the adult public toward party structures and organizations at the national level of government.  In order to assess the sources of influence on respondents' political attitudes and behavior, they were asked about issues they considered to be most important to both the local and state population, and to rank these issues in order of priority. Respondents were also asked for their opinion on public organizations in India, as well as their level of involvement in these organizations.  Respondents were asked if they aligned themselves with a party or a candidate, for whom they voted, and their level of involvement or previous experience in any party or candidate's political campaign.  At the national level, respondents were asked for their opinions on the Indian Congress, its role and strength in the government, actions taken and legislation passed by the Congress and the level of involvement it should take concerning bovine issues.  Also explored were the involvement and the opinion of the respondent's family and caste in the political process, party campaigns as well as interaction with party leaders.  Demographic information includes whether or not the respondent was from a rural or urban setting, their caste classification, gender, age, religion, household composition, occupation, fatherâ€™s occupation, level of education completed, and income and monthly expenditures."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political action"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political affiliation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DATAPASS I.
