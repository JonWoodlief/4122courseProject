In   an atmosphere of changed relations among the nations of Eastern and   Western Europe, this survey attempted to assess Central and Eastern   Europeans' awareness of and attitudes toward the European Community,   its programs and activities, and issues facing all European nations. It  also explored citizens' reactions to the political and economic reforms  occurring in their own countries. Surveys were carried out in   Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and the German Democratic   Republic, as well as in the former Soviet Union. The Soviet Union   samples were obtained from the Greater Moscow area and from   the republics of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova,  Georgia, Armenia, and Russia west of the Ural Mountains. In all surveys  comprising Euro-Barometer 1, demographic data usually included the   respondent's age, sex, level of education, family size, income,   occupation, marital status, and religious denomination. In some places,  mother tongue and self-described left-right political placement were   also ascertained. In most countries, respondents were asked how they   felt things were going in their country in general, how well their   country's economy and their own finances had fared over the past year,   whether they thought the establishment of a free market economy was   right or wrong, and whether economic reforms and privatization were   occurring too rapidly or too slowly. Satisfaction with the development   of democracy and with their own place in their political systems was   assessed. In some countries, respondents were asked about their   intention to vote in the next general election. Respondents in all   countries were asked how frequently they thought of themselves as   European, and about their level of trust to\nward citizens of other   European countries. They expressed opinions for or against the   reunification of Germany and the unification of Western Europe. They   were also asked to indicate how aware they were of, and how interested   in, the European Community and its activities and institutions, and to   rate how positively they regarded the European Community and the   prospect of their country's membership in the Community.   Country-specific questions were asked regarding sources of information   about the European Community. Several items concerned respondents'   reliance on various types of information media, including foreign   broadcasts. Participants were also asked about how the economy,   government, and private citizens might be advantaged or disadvantaged  by their country's increasing ties with the European Community."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"democracy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Economic Community"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international alliances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political awareness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"privatization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
