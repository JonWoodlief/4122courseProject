The survey instrument was based on the research team's experience in working with large personnel systems, instruments used in previous police staffing surveys, and discussions with police practitioners. The researchers collected initial feedback on the survey instrument through face-to-face meetings in Pittsburgh and Dallas with\nsworn and civilian staff having personnel administration responsibilities. A second round of testing involved sending emails to the contact person in the Columbus and Las Vegas departments to briefly explain the study and request assistance with questionnaire development. Once these departments agreed, a paper-and-pencil questionnaire was mailed to the contact person for completion. The contact person was asked to note any comments on problem questions, confusing terms, or insufficient answer choices. After receiving the completed questionnaire, the researchers called the contact person to discuss the responses and comments to the survey.

Initial surveys were mailed on February 27, 2008. Additional copies of the survey were mailed to nonrespondents on April 8, 2008 and again on May 19, 2008. Nonrespondents were also called a week and a half after each mailing in order to confirm that the packet had been received, encourage completion, and answer any questions.
