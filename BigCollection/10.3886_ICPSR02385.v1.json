As a result, unweighted tabulations on all  noncorrespondence schools will not match figures published by  NCES. The sample survey did not include flight schools and other  schools in the sampling frame. Nevertheless, long forms may be present  in the file for such schools if they were located in a state  requesting a special survey. Correspondence school data elements and  long form staffing variables were not imputed if missing. Long form  and short form programs and enrollments data were imputed if missing.  (2) This study has different card types and segments and for this  reason the number of records might vary for each case. There are also  three different Form Types for the study, FORM 1 is the short form  with 5,307 cases, FORM 2 is the long form with 1,675 cases, and FORM 3  is the Correspondence schools with 62 cases.
