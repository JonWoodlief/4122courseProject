Summary File 1 data  contain information compiled from the questions asked of all people  and of every housing unit enumerated in Census 2000: sex, age, race,  Hispanic or Latino origin, type of living quarters (household/group  quarters), household relationship, housing unit vacancy status, and  housing unit tenure (owner/renter). The information is presented in  286 tables, one variable per table cell, plus additional variables  with geographic information. Cases in the summary file data are  classified by levels of observation, known as \"summary levels\" in the  Census Bureau's nomenclature, which served as the selection criteria  for the subsets. Each subset comprises all of the cases in one of two  summary levels: whole census tracts (summary level 140) and census  tracts in places (summary level 158). The latter covers whole tracts  completely within places and portions of tracts that cross place  boundaries. Five files are provided for each subset. There is a file  for each of the four census regions (East, Midwest, South, and West)  and a combined national file. Puerto Rico is included in the national and South files."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household composition"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR I.A.1.e.

For each state (District of Columbia and Puerto Rico  included), there is one column-delimited file that contains geographic  identifiers (the geographic header record file or \"Geo\" file), plus 39  comma-delimited table files, each with a subset of tables in the  data. For reasons of confidentiality, table files 12-36 do not contain  data below the tract level. Consequently, they have fewer records than  the Geo file and table files 1-11 and 37-39. The subsets were produced  piece by piece, one state at a time. Initial steps in the production  of a subset for a state involved sorting its Geo file and 39 table  files in ascending order of the common identification variable  LOGRECNO, reformatting the Geo file as a comma-delimited file,  removing records with data below the tract level from table files 1-\n11  and 37-39, and stripping off the first five identification variables  from each of the 39 table files (FILEID, STUSAB, CHARITER, CIFSN, and  LOGRECNO). Next, the reformatted Geo file was merged with the stripped  table files so that corresponding records in the Geo and table files  were joined as a single record in the merged file. The state subset  was generated by extracting from the merged file all cases with a  given value for SUMLEV, the variable that identifies the summary  level. Separate subsets were generated for summary levels 140 and  158. After subsets were produced for every state, the national and  regional files were compiled by concatenating component state subsets  in ascending order of their state Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS) codes. (2) The following states are included in the  four regional files. Northeast: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New  Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and  Vermont. Midwest: Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,  Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and  Wisconsin. South: Alabama, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Delaware,  Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North  Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West  Virginia, and Puerto Rico. West: Alaska, Arizona, California,  Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah,  Washington, and Wyoming.  (3) The implied decimal places in variables  INTPTLAT (latitude) and INTPTLON (longitude) were made explicit in the  subsets. In addition, the values of all Geo variables were enclosed in  quotes, except for variables AREALAND, AREAWATR, POP100, HU100,  INTPTLAT, and INTPTLON. (4) The data definition statements were tested  with SAS 8, SPSS 10, and Stata/SE 7.0. (5) The codebook documents data  collection procedures, concepts, and individual variables in the  original Summary File data as well as the ICPSR-produced subsets, but  not the layout and structure of the subsets. That information is  contained in the data dictionary file provided with this  collection. In particular, the \"Data Structure and Segmentation\"  section in chapter 2 of the codebook and the variable locations shown  in chapter 7 do not apply to the subsets. Every subset file record  begins with the Geo variables in their original order. The Geo  variables are followed by the 6th to last variables in table file 1,  then the 6th to last variables in table file 2, and so on up to the  6th to last variables in table file 39.
