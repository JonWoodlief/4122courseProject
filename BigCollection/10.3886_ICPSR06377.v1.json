The RCG survey, which focuses heavily, but   not exclusively, on those graduates qualified to teach at the   elementary and secondary levels, is designed to meet the following   objectives: (1) to determine how many graduates become eligible or   qualified to teach for the first time and how many are employed as   teachers in the year following graduation, by teaching field, (2) to   examine the relationships among courses taken, student achievement,   and occupational outcomes, and (3) to monitor unemployment rates and   average salaries of graduates by field of study. The RCG survey   collects information on education and employment of all graduates (date   of graduation, field of study, whether newly qualified to teach,   further enrollment, financial aid, employment status, and teacher   employment characteristics) as well as standard demographic   characteristics such as earnings, age, marital status, sex, and  race/ethnicity."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic achievement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"careers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"college graduates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"earned degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment qualifications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupational status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher certification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teaching qualifications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment rate"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"wages and salaries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.

Institutions were stratified by control (public or   private), by region, and by the proportion of degrees awarded in the   field of education (over or under a specified number). Within each of   these strata, institutions were selected according to size (size being   measured by the sum of bachelor's and master's degrees awarded that   year). The second stage consisted of the selection of a core sample of   graduates (bachelor's and master's degree recipients) who received   their degrees from the sampled institutions during the 1976-1977   academic year. Sampling rates of graduates differed by major field of   study. The institution sample consisted of 300 institutions of which 30   were Historically Black Colleges (HBCs). The graduate sample was   stratified by degree received and major field of study (vocational   education, special education, other education, and noneducation).
