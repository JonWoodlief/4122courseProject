The  study was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and opinions  about the 2000 presidential election. Respondents were asked whether  they intended to vote in the upcoming presidential election on  November 7, 2000, and for whom they would vote if the election were  held on the day of the survey, given a choice among the following  candidates: Vice President Al Gore and Connecticut senator Joe  Lieberman (Democratic Party), Texas governor George W. Bush and  former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney (Republican Party),  conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (Reform Party), and consumer  advocate Ralph Nader (Green Party). Respondents were asked to give  their opinions of Gore and his job performance as vice president,  Bush and his job performance as governor of Texas, Cheney, Lieberman,  Buchanan, and Nader. Nader supporters were asked whether they would  consider changing their vote in support of Gore, if they thought the  presidential race was extremely close in their state. Views were  sought on how intelligent Gore and Bush were, as well as whether  either was prepared for the demands of the presidency. Additional  topics covered the fairness of the current income tax system, whether  military and defense spending should increase, whether laws governing  the sale of handguns should be stricter, whether a smaller government  with fewer services is preferable to a larger government with more  services, the importance of the outcome of the presidential election,  whether the government in Washington, DC, could be trusted, how the  budget surplus should be spent, whether it was preferable to have a  president and Congress from different political parties, the most  important problem facing the country, and whether respondents saw  their vote as a vote for or against the presidency of Bill Clinton,  or neither. Background information on respondents includes age,  gender, education, religion, political party, political orientation,  voter registration and participation history, race, Hispanic descent, children in household, years in community, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Buchanan,
