The most common  empirical approach for studying interstate influence is modeling an  indicator of a state's policy choice as a function of its neighbors'  policies, with each neighbor weighted equally. This can appropriately  specify one form of learning model, but it does not adequately test  for interstate competition: when a policy diffuses due to competition,  states' responses to other states vary depending on the size and  location of specific populations. The authors of this article  illustrate with two substantive applications how geographic  information systems (GI\nS) can be used to test for interstate  competition. They find that lottery adoptions diffuse due to  competition, rather than learning, but find no evidence of competition  in state choices about welfare benefits. The authors' empirical  approach can also be applied to competition among nations and local jurisdictions."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"geographic information systems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"research models"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
