They gave an approval rating of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and opinions of various mayoral candidates, including Herman Badillo, Michael Bloomberg, Fernando Ferrer, Michael Green, Alan G. Hevesi, and Peter Vallone. Respondents indicated whether they had voted for Giuliani in 1997, the amount of attention they had given to the 2001 mayoral campaign, their likelihood of voting in the primary, which candidate they would vote for, and their actual likelihood of voting for mayor. Opinions were elicited regarding which problem the new mayor should concentrate on, whether NYC had gotten better or worse in the past four years, the condition of the economy, their perception of safety, effectiveness and impartiality of the police force, NYC public transportation, the cost and availability of housing, unemployment rates, and whether respondents wanted to stay in NYC or live elsewhere. Respondents commented on the performance of Harold Levy as Chancellor of NYC schools, their satisfaction with NYC schools, support of tuition vouchers, and whether the NYC Board of Education should be eliminated. Those polled also gave their opinions of the state of race relations in NYC, whether organized prayer should be allowed in public schools, their opinions of the death penalty, and whether they or a family member had been a victim of crime in NYC. Respondents were also asked which characteristics they would prefer in a mayor, how they felt campaigns should be funded, and whether a new mayor would improve NYC. Background information on respondents includes political affiliation, whether respondents' financial situations had improved or worsened in the previous four years, whether their children attended public or private school, the importance of religion to them, their religious preference, marital status, education, age, race, and income category."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
