The goal of  the project was to amass information about approximately 500 counties  in 12 states of the Great Plains of the United States, and then to  analyze those data in order to understand the relationships between  population and environment that existed between the years of about  1870 and 2000. The data distributed here are all data about  counties. They fall into four broad categories: about the counties,  about agriculture, about demographic and social conditions, and about  the environment. The information about counties (name, area,  identification code, and whether the project classified the county as  part of the Great Plains in a given year) is embedded in each of the  other data files, so that there will be three series of data  (agriculture, demographic and social conditions, and environment),  containing individual data files for each year for which data are  available. The United States Census of Agriculture has been conducted  since 1850 on a regular schedule that was decennial until 1920, and  more frequently thereafter (every five years from 1925 to 1950, then  in 1954, 1959, 1964, 1978, and every five years since 1982). The  agricultural data included in this collection consist of a single data  file for each agricultural census year between 1870 and 1997 that  includes selected material compiled as part of the United States  Agricultural Census. The county-level agricultural data produced by  the United States government as part of the census constitute a consistent series of measures of changing agriculture and land use."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agricultural census"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agricultural land"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agricultural production"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agriculture"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"counties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crops"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"farms"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"historical data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"livestock"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nineteenth century"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"states (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"twentieth century"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR VI.

tract of land was  to be considered a farm. If the value of produce from small farm lots  fell below $100 in value, they were to be excluded from the count of  census farms. In 1870, the minimums rose to reflect economic change  and to help sort out some of the confusion that emerged in the South  with emancipation, including the subdivision of plantations and  attendant uncertainties in proprietorship. The preamble to the 1870  census declared that \"[n]o farm will be reported of less than three  acres, unless five hundred dollars' worth of produce has actually been  sold off from it during the year.\" This same definition was applied in  1880 and 1890.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1900 preamble, census officials  explained a return to the original standard of 1850 and offered some  cautionary advice. In reviewing the changing definition of census  farms they noted that in \"no [agricultural] census of the country had  one-half of the farms reported products of a value of $500, and the  proportion that had sold products of that value was much smaller. The  land occupied and the products secured by very many persons devoting  their entire time to caring for small dairies, apiaries, florists'  establishments, and kindred agricultural establishments were omitted  from reports, although those persons were properly included in the  occupation tables as dairymen, apiarists, florists, etc.\" Because of  these omissions from tabulated results in 1870, 1880, and 1890, census  marshals issued revised instructions to enumerators in 1900 that were  far more inclusive. This occupational and self-declared basis for  defining farms is further clarified by the explicit inclusion of  market-gardens, orchards, nurseries, cranberry marshes, greenhouses  and city dairies,\n<em>provided</em>\n, [emphasis in the  original] the entire time of at least one individual is devoted to  their care.</p>\n\n<p>By 1910, size and production minimums  returned in a definition that retained language about farms as the  agricultural operations of self-described farmers, with the added  provision that they again be tracts of farmland at least three acres  in size, no matter what the value of their produce, or if they fell  below the size minimum, that they employ the continuous services of at  least one person or produce at least $250 worth of farm products. This  definition was applied again in 1920, 1925, 1930, 1935, 1940, and  1945. However the value of production for farms under three acres was  not adjusted for inflation or deflation. The inclusion or exclusion of  very small farms in the census during these years relied, in part, on  changes in the price of agricultural commodities.</p>\n\n<p>In 1950, farms of three or more acres were included in the  census only if the value of their produce from the previous crop year,  in 1949, amounted to $150, and similarly operations under three acres  in size were included only if they met the minimum of $150 in sales  from the previous year.</p>\n\n<p>In 1959, the farm size and  product value minimums were adjusted again. The farm size minimum was  raised to ten acres, with sales of at least $50, and if farms fell  below ten acres, they were required to have estimated sales of at  least $250. Farms that fell below either of these product value  minimums were included in the census if they could\nbe expected to meet  them under normal conditions. The same census definition of census  farms was applied in 1964.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest change in  process came in 1969 with the switch from face-to-face enumeration to  enumeration by mail. Nonsample \"short\" forms were mailed to every  respondent on the Census Bureau's mailing list, a list furnished by  the United States Department of Agriculture.  By law, everyone on the  list was required to respond to the nonsample form. Respondents who  reported sales or acreage above specified levels on nonsample forms  were then sent correspondence requesting additional sample data. To  limit respondent burden, the nonsample form included only questions to  be reported at the county level. All county-level data are based on  the nonsample form.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest change in  definition occurred in 1974 when the acreage criterion was dropped and  a farm was defined as a place from which $1,000 in agricultural  products was produced and sold, or normally would have been sold. The  use of sales as the basic criterion meant that operations that focused  on household use or non-commercial distribution were no longer  regarded as farms. It is estimated that this change defined 300,000  farms out of existence nationally, an estimate made more precise by  the count of farms using both definitions in the 1974 Agricultural  Census and the 1980 Population Census (Bruce L. Gardner, American  Agriculture in the Twentieth Century: How It Flourished and What It  Cost. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 2002: 51-52). The $1,000  sales criterion persisted until the end of the twentieth  century.</p>\n\n<p>Adjustments were made to enumeration by  mail in 1978 to improve coverage, including a revised mail list and  the adoption of a direct area enumeration sample, including the use of  aerial photography, as a data checking method.</p>\n\n<p>In  1982, 3,653,000 nonsample forms were mailed in late December to  individuals, businesses and organizations on the mail list. Data  collection included a reminder card and five follow-up letters.  Further follow-up was conducted by mail and telephone for  nonrespondents in 14 states, and adjustments made to the final  results. All new farm successors reported by former operators were  researched to see if they had been included in the census mailing.  Report forms mailed to successor addresses not previously on the mail  file improved the coverage of the results.</p>\n\n<p>Since  1987, coverage evaluation reports have accompanied the publication of  the agricultural census to provide estimates of the completeness of  the enumeration. In 1997, the use of post-census sampling by the USDA  increased the count of United States farms from 1.97 to 2.06 million.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record abstracts"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"1870 Agricultural
