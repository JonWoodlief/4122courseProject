This protocol provides a uniform accounting system for treatment providers that ultimately translates costs by category into costs by unit of service. Each treatment provider may include up to eight service delivery units (SDUs), which are defined as a single treatment modality delivered a\nt a single geographic site. Data are entered into a series of spreadsheets within the template, beginning with the conversion of the provider's financial accounting reports into the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment's (CSAT's) chart of accounts structure and continuing through the allocation of costs using a step-down method of cost allocation. The allocation of costs will produce a \"cost profile\" of average cost per client by unit of service for each SDU. This data collection includes data f\nrom a purposive sample. These data are useful for examining patterns of service unit costs across the sampled SDUs. However, generalization to other providers or provider types is not possible. This release includes two files: (1) the SDU summary file for residential women and children (RWC) (78 records), and (2) cost data for all SDUS (213 records). The SDU summary file for RWC includes four SDU types: (1) residential pregnant and postpartum women, (2) residential long-term pregnant and postpar\ntum women, (3) residential short-term pregnant and postpartum women, and (4) residential women and children. The SATCAAT Study includes data for multiple years for some SDUs. Each year of data for each SDU constitutes one record. SATCAAT captures costs for 14 different services: initial assessment, medical exams, project evaluation, psychosocial evaluation, individual counseling, group counseling, HIV testing and counseling, medical and diagnostic services, housing and meals, clinical case manag\nement, networking and outreach, client transportation, client education, and staff education. The focus of the SDUs in the cost data file were (1) Aftercare, (2) Children, (3) Detox, (4) HIV, (5) Outpatient, (6) Residential, and (7) Women. This file includes 27 different SDU types based on the service delivery design of the sampled treatment providers (e.g., aftercare -- women only, outpatient aftercare -- adult, outpatient aftercare -- adolescent)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"client characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"service providers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"substance abuse treatment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"treatment costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SAMHDA XIX.
