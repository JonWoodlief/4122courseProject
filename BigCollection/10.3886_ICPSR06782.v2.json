Low-income, pregnant women bearing first babies were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: (1) subjects that received free transportation to prenatal care, (2) subjects that received transportation to prenatal care and developmental screening for the children, (3) subjects that received transportation to prenatal care and developmental screening, plus prenatal home visits by nurses, and (4) subjects that received transportation to prenatal care, developmental screening, prenatal home visits, and postnatal home visits by nurses. Assessments of the women covered health-related behaviors, mother's care-giving environment, child's health and development, levels of social support, mother's psychological resources, personal life-course development, and costs of health care. Variables measuring health-related behaviors included the use of cigarettes and illegal drugs and the presence of sexually-transmitted diseases. The mother's care-giving environment and the child's health and development were evaluated by the Bavolek adult-adolescent parenting interview score, the Caldwell home observation scale, the Bayley mental development index, the Achenbach child behavioral problems inventory, and other indices. Levels of social support were evaluated by the amount of support expected to be received from a boyfriend or husband and the mother's mother. Assessments of maternal psychological resources included the Pearlin mastery scale, the Shipley IQ score, and the Bandura self-efficacy score. Personal life-course development was assessed by the respondents' educational and occupational achievements, and the numbers of subsequent pregnancies and children. Variables measuring the effect of the program on the cost of health care include number of hospital emergency room visits, number of hospitalizations, total length of stay, number of well-child and ill-child doctor visits, and use of community social services. Other variables provide information on age at birth, pre-pregnancy weight, birth weight and gender, race, employment status, income, housing density, and education."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prenatal care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"visiting nurses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR XII.
