Respondents were also asked if they favored the United States using its military forces to keep Serbia from violating the United Nations ban on Serbian flights over Bosnia, whether it was more important for the United States to be involved in Somalia or the former Yugoslavia, and whether helping the homeless and hungry in the United States was more important than trying to get food to the people in Somalia.
