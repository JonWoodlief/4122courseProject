We performed multivariate analysis to identify risk factors for PE, including the covariate of age, marital status, International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score, serum testosterone levels, and all components of MetS. Acquired PE was defined as self-reported intravaginal ejaculation latency time â‰¤3 minutes, and MetS was diagnosed using the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOf 1,029 men, 74 subjects (7.2%) had acquired PE and 111 (10.8%) had MetS. Multivariate analysis showed that the IIEF overall satisfaction score (odds ratio [OR]=0.67, p<0.001), NIH-CPSI pain score (OR=1.07, p=0.035), NIH-CPSI voiding score (OR=1.17, p=0.032), and presence of MetS (OR=2.20, p=0.022) were significantly correlated with the prevalence of acquired PE. In addition, the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction scores and ejaculation anxiety scores progressively decreased as the number of components of MetS increased.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nMetS may be an independent predisposing factor for the development of acquired PE. Effective prevention and treatment of MetS could also be important for the prevention and treatment of acquired PE."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Park, Hyun Jun"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-01-31"}]}},"files":[{"label":"TESTOSTERONE_raw date_T_AC_PE.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":149999,"dataFile":{"id":3349507,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"TESTOSTERONE_raw date_T_AC_PE.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":219371,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168a6245ca8-7a63cc54fb85","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","originalFileSize":210990,"UNF":"UNF:6:Ux1777nrSTRqqFNrUNb+pg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"547a6f923e329a88fe2f70ad9f65d9d4","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"547a6f923e329a88fe2f70ad9f65d9d4"}}}]}}}
