The major purposes of the study were: (1) to determine if different collegiate environments were similarly perceived and used by male and female students; and (2) to assess the impact of the collegiate environment on the development of sex role patterns.\r\n<br /><br />  The sample consisted of freshmen and senior students from six Massachusetts colleges. The samples were drawn by randomly selecting names from student rosters from each of the schools. Approximately 2,000 questionnaires were distributed to students at the six participating schools in December, 1973. By the spring of 1974, 819 usable questionnaires had been returned.<br /><br />  The self-administered questionnaire explored factors which affected satisfaction with college and influenced the student's choice of college. It included items on career and marriage expectations, attitudes, interests, and future plans. Sex role attitudes were also investigated. In addition, objective data were collected from each of the six schools regarding health, athletic and residential facilities, admissions and financial aid, work grants and employment opportunities, curriculum and instruction, student counseling, and activities. Some objective data are confidential.\r\n<br /><br/>The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (paper records).
