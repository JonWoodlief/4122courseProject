Countries participating included Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), South Korea (Korea), Bulgaria, Germany, Mexico, and the United States. Data were collected from teachers in their first and last year of preparation by sampling institutions in each country. Future teachers were asked about their backgrounds, course-taking and program activities, knowledge relevant to their teaching (mathematical and pedagogical), and beliefs and perspectives on content and pedagogy.</p>\n\n<p>The 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data revealed that countries with higher achievement have teachers who teach substantially different content than that of their less accomplished counterparts (see Schmidt et al., 1996; Schmidt et al., 2001). The 1996 Report of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future argued that what teachers know and do in the classroom matters for pupil learning. It also argued that teacher education might be a viable policy tool to improve the quality of education (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 1996). United States reform efforts are consistent with this line of thought. They have introduced standards to measure teacher quality as it relates to student achievement. This, in turn, led to accountability concerns regarding teacher preparation programs (INTASC, 1995; Murray, 2000; Leithwood, Edge and Jantzi, 1999; NCATE, 2000).</p>\n\n<p>The MT21 Project was designed to answer the following question: how shall we prepare our future teachers to teach a more rigorous curriculum to all students? Several assumptions were made going into this work: the concepts and models defining teacher preparation are not fixed across the world. Recognizing and understanding this diversity to develop a cross-national study of teacher preparation poses a complex and challenging problem. It is hoped that the resulting international data would not only serve to provide policy insights but would also bring about change by making visible contrasts with other countries in terms of teacher preparation in the United States.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this study is to examine how teacher preparation is done differently across several high-achieving countries. The 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) has argued that curriculum is important to learning, and that the United States curriculum in middle school is not adequately meeting international standards. Despite these findings, questions of the role of the teachers' subject matter knowledge in delivering that curriculum are mostly unanswered. Which learning experiences matter most in preparing teachers to teach challenging mathematics? What should the balance be across the three areas of mathematics, mathematics education, and general pedagogy? These are the most important questions to be addressed especially given the limitation of time associated with typical university preparation. It is only by moving outside the United States education culture that we are likely to find major alternative models that can challenge our own assumptions and provide a basis for curriculum policy change in teacher education."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The MT21 Project sought to use international comparative studies' potential to make clearer important aspects of teacher preparation. The decision was made to conduct the study in a small number of countries that had shown substantial differences in international comparisons of students' mathematics achievement. After discussions with researchers from a number of countries, the final research was conducted in Bulgaria, Germany, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States.</p>\n\n<p>There were three major routes for secondary teacher preparation across these countries. The first route (Bulgaria, Taiwan, Korea) prepares secondary teachers and that includes the preparation of middle school teachers. The second route focuses specifically on preparing middle school teachers (Mexico). The third route is preparing middle school teachers as part of an elementary teacher preparation program. Germany uses both the first and second routes, while the United States uses all three routes. Students were sampled from all three routes for study participation.</p>\n\n<p>MT21 sought to measure what individuals learned in their teacher preparation programs by surveying students' learning opportunities  as they are structured and provided by educational institutions and faculties of mathematics, mathematics pedagogy, and general pedagogy. Three surveys were developed for this purpose: an Institution Survey, a Faculty Survey, and a Future Teacher Survey.
