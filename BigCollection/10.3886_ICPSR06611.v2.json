Opinions were sought on New York politicians Mario Cuomo, George  Pataki, Daniel Moynihan, and Bernadette Castro. Responde\nnts were also  asked how they would vote in the upcoming gubernatorial, senate,  comptroller, and attorney general races. The survey was carried out on  October 26-29, 1994, further into the campaign season than when  respondents were queried for CBS NEWS/NEW YORK TIMES NEW YORK STATE  POLL #1, OCTOBER 1994 (ICPSR 6610). New subjects covered in this poll  included whether the respondent had seen television ads for the  various candidates, and whether the recent endorsements by Bill  Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani of Mario Cuomo would affect the  respondent's voting behavior. In addition, more specific questions on  the subjects covered in Poll #1 were asked of the respondents to Poll  #2, instead of the many open-ended questions contained in Poll  #1. Respondents were asked to identify major problems that faced New  York State, whether those problems would get better or worse if Mario  Cuomo or George Pataki were elected governor, and whether Cuomo or  Pataki cared more about the needs and problems of the people living in  New York City, the suburbs around New York City, or people living in  upstate New York. Opinions were also sought on Bill Clinton, the death  penalty, homosexuality, and abortion. Background information includes  voter registration status, household composition, vote choice in the  1992 presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
