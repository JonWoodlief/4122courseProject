All the changes from Version 1 to Version 2 were made at the request of the Editor of Psychological Science prior to the publication of the paper. The changes pertain to improving the clarity of downloading and file opening instructions. There are two files in this Dataverse: (1) ReadMe_Downloading Instructions.rtf and (2) Data and Materials.txt. Please read note for each file before attempting to open the files. Several additional changes were made in Version 3 created on 4/24/2017. These changes are precipitated by the following developments. After publishing the paper, we discovered a minor error in A’ calculations that resulted in barely noticeable errors in reported A’ values. To address this issue, we posted a new table of A-prime values (one tab for Experiment 1 and another for Experiment 2). As shown in the table, although some statistical terms, p-values, and effect sizes changed, these changes are exceedingly small, with none of the reported effects getting weaker as a result of these changes. Our decision to publish these errata is driven by the desire to avoid confusion if our data are re-analyzed. Version 4.0 was created on 4/29/2017. We discovered that (1) in the raw data file two (out of 1120) trials were mislabeled and (2) one participant’s subject number did not match between different phases of the experiment (we would like to thank Dr. John Christie of Dalhousie University for noticing these errors). To address this, we had to go back to individual subject’s files and fix these errors manually. We therefore, added the corrected data file to Version 4.0 (without replacing the original data file).\r\n"},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NIH"},"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"R01HD078545"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NIH"},"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"P01HD080679"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sloutsky, Vladimir"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-01-18"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This is a ReadMe file.
