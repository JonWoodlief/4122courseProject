The dataset was taken from the Second National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (2000) in the UK. The data consists of sexual behavioural patterns from over 12 000 UK men and women aged between 16 and 44 years.   In their research, they found that ethnicity, living accommodation, age at first sexual experience, length of time in school, and to a lesser extend, contraception at sexual debut and number of sexual partners were predictive of individuals who sough abortion on more than one occasion.    Since the sampling technique used in the actual study was not adopted in the replicated study, we could only find results in the similar direction."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-02-06"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stone, Nicole, and Roger Ingham. \"Who presents more than once?
