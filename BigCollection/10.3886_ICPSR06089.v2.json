Questions were posed regarding respondents' vote intentions for the 1992 presidential election, their opinions of the 1992 presidential candidates and their running mates, and the likelihood of their voting in the 1992 presidential election. Survey questions covered Bill Clinton's draft status, the economy, and the respondent's approval rating of George Bush with respect to his handling of the presidency. Respondents were also asked various questions pertaining to the first and second presidential debates to determine if they were likely to watch the debates and would be willing to participate in special surveys following the debates. Background information on respondents includes sex, age, race, education, religious preference, family income, political orientation, party preference, voter regi\nstration status, and vote choices in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
