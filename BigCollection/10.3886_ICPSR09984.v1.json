More specifically, the data explore the contributions of   parental substance abuse and domestic violence in prediction of parolee   violence. The study also investigates the effects of drug and alcohol   use on domestic violence for the parolee, the spouse, and the parents.   The data were drawn from individual interviews conducted with parolees   from the Buffalo, New York, area, half of whom were convicted of   violent crimes and half of whom were convicted of nonviolent crimes.   Interviews were also conducted with the spouses and partners of the   parolees. In addition, data concerning the parolees' criminal histories   were abstracted from arrest and parole records. Part 1, Demographic   File 1, provides information on the demographic characteristics of   offenders, arrests, convictions, and sentencing, institutional   transfers, disciplinary reports, indications of psychiatric diagnosis   or psychological disturbances, alcohol and drug use, criminal activity,   and substance abuse while incarcerated. Part 2, Demographic File 2,   includes the same variables as Part 1 (with the exception of   information about psychiatric diagnoses, psychological disturbances,   and disciplinary reports) for those individuals who declined to be   interviewed and a random sample of those who could not be contacted.   Part 3, the Interview File, contains information about childhood social   histories (including sociodemographics, experience of family violence   as a victim and as a witness, and parental drug and alcohol use),   self-reported criminal histories, adult social histories (including   data concerning violence in current relationships, and drug and alcohol   use history), and information about the parolees' and spouses'   discipline styles. The researchers discarded data on female parolees  for the purposes of their analysis."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminality prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"domestic violence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family violence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parental influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parolees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"substance abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
