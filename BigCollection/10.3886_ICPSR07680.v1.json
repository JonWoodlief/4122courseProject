The purposes of the  study were to determine the importance of outdoor recreation to the  American people, patterns of recreational land use, trends in  recreation, the users of federal land, and the deterrents,  satisfactions, and preferences for outdoor recreation. People who were  interviewed ranged from urbanites out for an afternoon at New York  City Gateway National Recreation Area to backpackers returning from a  two-week adventure in the Bitterroot Wilderness of the Nezperce  National Forest in Idaho. Respondents were asked to report which  activities among a list of 30 they had participated in during the last  12 months, which ones they planned to participate in during the  current trip, and which they hoped to take part in in the next 12  months. They also were asked the purpose of their current trip, their  level of satisfaction with their experiences so far, suggested  improvements to the specific recreation area, their opinions of the  importance of outdoor recreation in general, the importance they  placed on having outdoor recreation facilities within walking distance  and within one hour's driving distance, the impact of the price of  gasoline on the number and duration of auto trips taken to outdoor  recreation areas, and preferences for allocation of federal recreation  funds in the future. Personal information includes respondents' age,  sex, race, highest level of schooling completed, occupation, income,  urban or rural residence, and state of residence. The United States  Department of the Interior also conducted a separate but related  telephone survey during the same year on a national sample of  respondents (see OUTDOOR RECREATION SURVEY, 1977: GENERAL POPULATION  SURVEY [ICPSR 7679]). The primary reason for conducting two separate  studies was to ensure representative samples for comparing recreation  characteristics of the entire citizenry of the United States with those who pursue recreational activities on federal land."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"automobile use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leisure"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national parks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"natural resources"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"outdoor recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation expenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"time utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.F.

The first sampling unit was the land area involved, with each  discrete land area being stratified by federal agency (e.g., national  parks for the National Park Service, and national forests for the  United States Forest Service). For analytic purposes, approximately 40  areas were selected for each of the three largest providers of public  recreation, i.e., National Park Service, National Forest Service, and  the Corps of Engineers. Areas of the other four land managing agencies  were selected proportional to the total opportunities they provided.  The area listing included only those with recreation facilities  managed by a federal agency. Within each federal agency, land areas  were chosen at random with probabilities proportionate to official  yearly visitation statistics after first being stratified by the  appropriate federal regions. Thus, a park with two million visitors  had twice the chance of being chosen at random as a park with one million visitors."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Outdoor Recreation Survey, 1977 Federal Estate Survey","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":40314,"dataFile":{"id":2652815,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Outdoor Recreation Survey, 1977 Federal Estate Survey","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
