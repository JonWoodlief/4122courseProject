The surveys also collected information regarding computer and Internet usage, including training, type of equipment, locations of use, frequency and duration of use, and about information and services respondents would like to find on the Internet. A major focus of the surveys was concern about issues of immigration and the right of asylum with questions pertaining to unemployment, social inequality, urban violence, terrorism, war, and various types of crime such as illegal immigration, smuggling, and illegal trafficking of drugs and human beings. Respondents were also asked about the importance and desirability of certain measures associated with addressing these issues as well as their level of agreement with selected statements regarding immigration, immigrants, asylum, asylum seekers, and citizen rights. Respondents were further questioned about the place of people belonging to racial, religious, and cultural minorities. Another focus of the surveys was the subject of EU agricultural policies with respondents being queried about competition, diversification, economic support, and benefits to consumers as well as farmers. Two additional areas of inquiry included rail services and consumer protection. The series of questions regarding rail services asked about frequency of train travel in the past 12 months, quality of rail services, handicap accessibility, ticket prices, schedule information, and complaints made in the past 12 months. Questions pertaining to consumer protection asked about aspects of the Single European Market, products or services bought or ordered from another EU country, advertising of products and services by other EU countries, and about the safety of products and services. Demographic information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status, left-right political  self-placement, occupation, age at completion of education, type and size of locality, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European unification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
