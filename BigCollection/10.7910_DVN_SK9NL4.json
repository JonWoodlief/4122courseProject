A volunteer was defined as \"someone working in some way to help others for no monetary pay.\" The activities of volunteers assessed included fundraising, education, administration, recreation, arts/crafts, clerical work, direct services, transportation, and crisis intervention. The interview included questions about the range of volunteer activities in which respondents participated, motivations for volunteerism, demographic information, and the awareness of public debate on issues of volunteerism.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (audiocassette recordings of pilot interviews used to refine instruments for the project are also available).
