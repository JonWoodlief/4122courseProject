This structure commonly produces unmodeled correlation within clusters, leading to downward bias in the standard errors of regression coefficients. Estimating robust cluster standard errors (RCSE) is a common approach to correcting this bias. However, despite their frequent use, recent work indicates that RCSE can also be biased downward. Here I show evidence of that bias and offer a potential solution. Through Monte Carlo simulation of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, I compare conventional standard error (OLS-SE) and RCSE performance to that of a bootstrap method that resamples clusters of observations (BCSE). I show that both OLS-SE and RCSE are biased downward, with OLS-SE being the most biased. In contrast, BCSE are not biased and consistently outperform the other two methods. I conclude with three replications from recent work and offer recommendations to researchers."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clustered Data; Standard Errors; Monte Carlo Simulation"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harden, Jeffrey J. 2011. \"A Bootstrap Method for Conducting Statistical Inference with Clustered Data.\" Forthcoming, State Politics and Policy Quarterly."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-05-23"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Online appendix, R simulation code, and full results.","label":"Harden (2011) Online Supplement.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54579,"dataFile":{"id":2138063,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Harden (2011) Online Supplement.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":168578,"description":"Online appendix, R simulation code, and full results.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:62492","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"595a180dc4645b2152f987633c8b7676","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"595a180dc4645b2152f987633c8b7676"}}}]}}}
