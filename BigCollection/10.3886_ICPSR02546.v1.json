Respondents were asked for their opinions  of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, as well  as their views on independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Microsoft CEO  Bill Gates. Those queried were also asked to comment on a judge's  decision to dismiss former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones's  sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill Clinton and Jones's initial  decision to appeal that dismissal, the investigation into an alleged  affair between former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and Bill  Clinton, the investigation into the Clintons' role in the Whitewater  land deals, and what the repercussions should be if Clinton lied under  oath about his relations with either Jones or Lewinsky. Items on  scruples probed for whether respondents would do any of the following:  copy a musical CD for a friend, take hotel towels, falsely call in  sick at work, keep extra money from an automated teller machine, sneak  someone into a movie at a reduced child's price, inform an employer of  a coworker's abuse of disabili\nty leave, or make a false claim of theft  to an insurance company. A series of questions addressed the power of  religion and prayer in healing, what people ask for through prayer,  exorcism, the existence of the devil, and communicating with the dead  through mediums. An additional topic covered computer access and use,  including electronic mail and the Internet, and participation in  on-line polls. Background information on respondents includes age,  race, sex, ethnicity, education, religion, marital status, political  party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, age of children in household, and stock market investments."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
