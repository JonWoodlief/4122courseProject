The survey for the 2007 Presidential Election Panel Studies in South Korea was conducted from April to December 2007 in six waves with a large-scale panel of 3,500 representing the nation's gender, age, region, and education proportions.The study analyzed factors that influence the formation and change of voter preferences through three broad theoretical frameworks: (1) The sociological model that explains voter preference as a reflection of major social fragmentation (education, gender, income, religion, region, etc.); (2) The psychological model of the Michigan School that explains voter preference formation and change as activation of party identification in United States or Western elections, and regional identification in Korea as a proxy; (3) The rational voter model that posits that individuals, after calculating their own interests, support candidates or parties that possess the policies and ideology to maximize those interests. Tracking core questions are questions that repeatedly track the change in vote determinants, the core project of the current study. The tracking core questions that will track public opinion change over the entire period of the panel surveys consist of questions about attitudes on candidate factors, political party factors, election campaigns, issues, and policies. Whenever possible, the questions use the wording of international surveys such as the ANES questionnaire to allow international comparisons, but when not appropriate to the reality of Korean elections, new question items are developed. The current study analyzed which of the three models is the most appropriate in explaining Korean elections and voter preference."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign affairs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"opinions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XI.

The panel study sample was selected using stratified random sampling. The data for setting the quotas were determined from the Resident Registration data as of December 31, 2006, published by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs, with the quotas set according to demographic proportions by age, by gender, and by region. The sample was allocated by crossing the proportions of each region (the 16 metropolitan self-governing bodies), gender (male/female), and age group (29 years of age and under, 30-39 years of age, 40-49 years of age, 50 years of age and over).

On the other hand, from Wave IV on, the panel attrition rate decreased drastically to within 5 percent. It may be considered that in order to raise th\ne panel retention rate it is important to reduce the attrition rate early on in the panel study such as in Wave II or Wave III.
