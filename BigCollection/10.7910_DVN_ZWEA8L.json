However, traditional modeling of these outcomes ignores\r\ncommon data issues and cannot capture nuances. There is often an excess of\r\nzeros, the observed outcomes for different actors are inherently related, and competing actors may respond to the same factors differently. This paper extends\r\nexisting models and develops a zero-inflated multivariate ordered probit to simultaneously address these issues. This model performs better than existing models\r\nat capturing the true parameters of interest, estimates the nature of the related\r\nprocesses, and captures the differences in actorsâ€™ decision-making.
