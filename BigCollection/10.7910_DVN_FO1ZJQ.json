The study was designed to explore the broad range of health issues and health care needs as defined by lesbians throughout the United States. For the purpose of this survey, health was defined holistically, and incorporated the following dimensions: community and social life; general health and health care; gynecological health and health care; mental health and health care; stress and methods of coping; substance abuse and eating disorders; physical and sexual abuse and help-seeking behaviors; discrimination; self-care; and the extent of \"outness\".\r\n<br /><br />  The 10-page closed-ended questionnaire used in the survey includes demographic and background information and questions addressing the range of topics used to define health. Questions were formulated from the knowledge, experience, and perceptions of health care workers who have direct contact with the lesbian population.<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds
