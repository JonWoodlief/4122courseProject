Questions regarding the upcoming   United States House of Representatives election asked respondents how   closely they were following it, the likelihood that they would vote,   whether they would vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate,   whether they planned to re-elect their own representative in   Congress, and how often they voted in state elections when there was   no presidential race.
