Respondents were asked to comment on what they thought was the most important problem facing the country, and to give their approval rating of George Bush with respect to his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy. Questions were also posed regarding respondents' vote intentions for the 1992 presidential election, their opinions of potential 1992 presidential candidates, the likelihood of their voting in either a Republican or Democratic presidential primary or caucus, their candidate preferences for the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, and the issues that presidential candidates should emphasize. Respondents were quest\nioned concerning the allegations made about Bill Clinton's character, the treatment Clinton had received by the news media, how well Congress was handling its job, and whether the respondent's own representative had done a good enough job to deserve reelection. Questions concerning Bush and Clinton covered their abilities to deal with an international crisis, their leadership qualities, the likelihood that one of them could end the recession, their concern for the needs and problems of people, their honesty and integrity, and their plans for the next four years. Those surveyed were also asked about the availability of jobs, various income tax proposals, government help for Blacks, fighting in the Persian Gulf, abortion, term limits for members of Congress, whether the Bush administration or Congress was more trustworthy in dealing with domestic problems, and whether Bush had really tried to work with the Democrats in Congress. Additional questions covered the Congressional check-writing scandal, Hillary Clinton, the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, and the United Nations resolution requiring Saddam Hussein to destroy the sites where he was developing atomic weapons. Background information on respondents includes sex, age, race, marital status, education, religious preference, family income, political orientation, and party preference."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
