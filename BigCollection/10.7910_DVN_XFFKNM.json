In fact, a vulnerability approach to disasters would suggest that\r\ninequalities in exposure and sensitivity to risk as well as inequalities in access to resources, capabilities, and\r\nopportunities systematically disadvantage certain groups of people, rendering them more vulnerable to the impact\r\nof natural disasters. In this article we address the specific vulnerability of girls and women with respect to\r\nmortality from natural disasters and their aftermath. Biological and physiological differences between the sexes\r\nare unlikely to explain large-scale gender differences in mortality rates. Social norms and role behaviors provide\r\nsome further explanation, but what is likely to matter most is the everyday socioeconomic status of women. In a\r\nsample of up to 141 countries over the period 1981 to 2002 we analyze the effect of disaster strength and its\r\ninteraction with the socioeconomic status of women on the change in the gender gap in life expectancy. We find,\r\nfirst, that natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women more than that of men. In other words, natural\r\ndisasters (and their subsequent impact) on average kill more women than men or kill women at an earlier age\r\nthan men. Since female life expectancy is generally higher than that of males, for most countries natural disasters\r\nnarrow the gender gap in life expectancy. Second, the stronger the disaster (as approximated by the number of\r\npeople killed relative to population size), the stronger this effect on the gender gap in life expectancy. That is,\r\nmajor calamities lead to more severe impacts on female life expectancy (relative to that of males) than do smaller\r\ndisasters. Third, the higher women’s socioeconomic status, the weaker is this effect on the gender gap in life\r\nexpectancy. Taken together our results show that it is the socially constructed gender-specific vulnerability of\r\nfemales built into everyday socioeconomic patterns that lead to the relatively higher female disaster mortality\r\nrates compared to men."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-02"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for Annals (disasters).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79105,"dataFile":{"id":2769647,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/XFFKNM/9JJIGH","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XFFKNM/9JJIGH","filename":"Article for Annals (disasters).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":1181,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15204dccddb-712f584a3291","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6e36ae94c37432c916947fc1eddda9d1","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6e36ae94c37432c916947fc1eddda9d1"}}},{"description":"Data","label":"Article for Annals (disasters).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79105,"dataFile":{"id":2769648,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/XFFKNM/5QEFZG","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XFFKNM/5QEFZG","filename":"Article for Annals (disasters).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":553803,"description":"Data","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15204dd3937-9ef3b6cb28f8","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:+5Auhnz7X/3iMbN6mz+lxQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"8f74c5ad25d854af84edaa00b3f409bc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"8f74c5ad25d854af84edaa00b3f409bc"}}}]}}}
