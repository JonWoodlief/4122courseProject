Respondents were asked whether they approved of Bill Clinton's handling of his job as president and whether he had tried to move the country in the right or the wrong direction. Opinions were sought on Clinton, Bob Dole, Al Gore, Newt Gingrich, Al D'Amato, Jesse Helms, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Respondents were asked to provide their reactions to the outcome of the November 1994 elections for Congress, to give their opinions on the Republican and Democratic parties, and to forecast whether Congress would accomplish more or less in the next two years on topics such as the Republicans' \"Contract with America,\" the balanced budget amendment, welfare, and health care. Additional areas explored included the situation in Bosnia, Bill Clinton's handling of the situation, and the need for sending in ground troops to try to end the fighting. Background information includes voter registration status, household composition, vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
