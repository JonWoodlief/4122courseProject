Data were selected from the NCVS to examine the issues described  above. Both the NCVS telephone and personal interviews are conducted  such that the respondent must tell the interviewer about the nature of  the victimization in her own words without answering yes/no  questions. It is hypothesized that the inclusion of such yes/no  questions would more easily allow victims to report rape or domestic  violence incidents in telephone interviews, even with spouses present  in the home during the interview.
