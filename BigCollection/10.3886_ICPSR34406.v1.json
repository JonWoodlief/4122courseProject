The client's age was categorized into ranges. Also, the file originally contained exact dates of a client's initial contact with the facility, clinical assessment, and first treatment visit. These three dates were recoded in the public use data file. First the month, day, and year were split out into individual components. Secondly, the day of the month was deleted completely. Next the month component was combined into quarters (January - March, April - June, July - September, and October - December). Finally, the quarter and year were combined back together.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>Four new variables were computed to provide additional utility to users in their analysis. The number of follow-up treatment visits the client made after their initial visit was summed (TRT_TOT). The other three new variables involve the three original dates mentioned above. They were used to calcuate the exact difference in days between the three events before the dates were recoded. If the value was zero the events occurred on the same day.

There were 327 organizations that submitted a letter of intent of which 46 were selected to submit a full proposal. Eligibility was limited to non-profit substance abuse treatment organizations with at least 100 admissions per year and the ability to control a continuum of care either within the corporation or through networking arrangements. Selection criteria included potential communit\ny input, evidence of a leadership commitment, ability to move patients between levels of care, systems to collect and report data, suitable financial health, perceived strength of the project team, and a willingness to participate in a learning community. Ten facilities were funded starting in August 2003 by RWJF, and an additional 15 awards were given out in January 2005. Each award was for 18 months.</p>\n<p>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) sent out a separate request for applications with similar eligibility requirements.
