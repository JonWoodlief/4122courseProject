The   first longitudinal study to concentrate on the process of retirement   and to include change over a period of time as an object of study, the   six surveys in the Retirement History Longitudinal Survey (RHLS) aimed   at learning in detail the connections between worklife characteristics,   retirement timing, and the determinants of style, quality, and conduct   of retirement. This study was meant to gather first-year data as the   baseline for future trend analysis on the sample. To provide information  on pre-retirement lives and attitudes of respondents, questions were  asked regarding labor force history, retirement and retirement plans,   health, household, family and social activities, income, assets, and   debts for respondents and their spouses. Surviving members of this   original 1969 sample were interviewed subsequently at two-year intervals.    Labor force questions in this baseline survey covered the respondent's   occupation and attitudes toward that occupation, number of hours   worked, salary, and unemployment and job-seeking behavior. Information   on retirement plans was also elicited, including whether and when   the respondents planned to retire, reasons for retirement,   whether they had made retirement plans, such as moving residences   or working after retirement, expected expenses and resources,   workplace pension plans, amount of benefits, Social Security benefits,   and subjective attitudes toward retirement. Respondents who were already   partially or fully retired were asked to report retrospectively on   retirement age, reasons for retirement, and whether they had planned for   retirement prior to actually retiring. Questions on health experience   pertained to the calendar year prior to the interview, and included   receipts and costs of physical examinations and dentist visits,   hospitalization, prescription and non-prescription medicines, other medical  supplies and services, health insurance coverage and other resources  for payment of medical expenses, and a measure of the respondents' own  physical health. Questions were asked concerning activity and income,  including proximity and frequency of contact with close relatives, and  receipt of financial support from relatives. Information on food and  housing, transportation, gifts, and travel expenses was also gathered  to provide a measure of changes in retirement lifestyle. Demographic  items specify race, sex, age, marital status, education, income,   benefits amount, assets, debts, number of children and children   attending school, and household composition and relationship. Proxy   respondents were not allowed to answer any questions in this survey,\nwith the exception of spouses who could answer questions concerning  spousal labor force history."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"older workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personal finances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement adjustment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement planning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.D.
