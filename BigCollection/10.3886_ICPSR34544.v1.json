Certain hospital data elements were available throughout 2006. An additional year of 2011 follow-up data was also available for a subset of patients receiving medication treatment. The purpose of the data capture was to advance patient-centered outcomes research to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cancer and other comorbidities.</p>\n\n<p>A breast cancer pilot study was also conducted from a subset of all transmitted EMR records, consisting of admission records with a principal and/or secondary ICD-9-CM diagnosis between 174.0 and 174.9.  The subset dataset was then linked to the central cancer registry using patient social security number, first and last name, and date of birth.  Using a deterministic matching algorithm a total of 11,506 unique patients were matched to a patient in the FCDS database, resulting in 12,804 primary tumors and 53,940 unique hospital admission records.  While the hospital EMR defined the patient dataset, all registry records for that patient were included in the final breast cancer pilot database, regardless of the reporting hospital or the date of diagnosis.  This was to ensure capture of the entire diagnostic and treatment profile for each breast cancer patient.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Access</strong></p>\n\n<p>These data are not available from ICPSR.
