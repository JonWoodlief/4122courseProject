To accomplish this, the principal  investigator conducted a survey of police and prosecutor agencies  across the country to determine how stalking laws were being  implemented. While there had been significant federal support for  state and local agencies to adopt anti-stalking laws and implement  anti-stalking initiatives, no comprehensive review of the status of  such efforts had been done. Thus, there had been no way of knowing  what additional measures might be needed to enhance local  anti-stalking efforts. Two national surveys on stalking were  conducted. The first survey of 204 law enforcement agencies (Part 1,  Initial Law Enforcement Survey Data) and 222 prosecution offices (Part  3, Initial Prosecutor Survey Data) in jurisdictions with populations  over 250,000 was conducted by mail in November of 1998. The survey  briefly asked what special efforts the agencies had undertaken against  stalking, including special units, training, or written policies and  procedures. A replication of the first national survey was conducted  in November of 2000. Part 2, Follow-Up Law Enforcement Survey Data,  contains the follow-up data for law enforcement agencies and Part 4,  Follow-Up Prosecutor Survey Data, contains the second survey data for  prosecutors. Parts 1 to 4 include variables about the unit that  handled stalking cases, types of stalking training provided, written  policies on stalking cases, and whether statistics were collected on  stalking and harassment.

However, notwithstanding a sizable literature about  stalking as a legal construct and as a medical issue, systematic  information about this crime and what has been done about it was  largely missing. Most significantly, a policy analysis of what needed  to be done to improve anti-stalking investigation, prosecution, and  provision of services to stalking victims was totally absent. This  study of the status of stalking laws and their implementation in the  United States was conducted to fill this knowledge gap. The premises  for this research are that stalking is a serious crime against persons  and that it is widely prevalent. While there had been significant  f\nederal support for state and local agencies to adopt anti-stalking  laws and implement anti-stalking initiatives, no comprehensive review  of the status of such efforts had been done.
