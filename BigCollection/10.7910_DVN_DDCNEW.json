In this study, 23,800 citizens were randomly assigned to receive visits from political activists during the lead-up to the 2010 French regional elections. Treatment increased the turnout of immigrants without having any statistically significant effect on non-immigrants, while turnout was roughly equal in the control group. A postelectoral survey reveals that immigrants initially had less political information, which could explain the heterogeneous impact. Although the effect decays over subsequent elections, our findings suggest that voter outreach efforts can successfully increase immigrants' political participation, even when they do not specifically target their communities and concerns."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pons, Vincent, and Guillaume Liegey. \"Increasing the Electoral Participation of Immigrants: Experimental Evidence from France.\" Economic Journal (Royal Economic Society) (forthcoming)."}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Rubio, Karl"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-02-21"}]}},"files":[{"label":"PUBLISH.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":139858,"dataFile":{"id":3127341,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/DDCNEW/SXOQH8","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DDCNEW/SXOQH8","filename":"PUBLISH.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":98909682,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:161ba391511-6f1b14529d1c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"23e5623b9994f8bcab6026364584f97a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"23e5623b9994f8bcab6026364584f97a"}}}]}}}
