In this paper we seek to provide new insights into\r\nhow geography shapes these spatiotemporal variations, focusing on two leading examples of codified\r\nvoluntarism: ISO 14001 and the Global Compact (GC). In an advance on previous quantitative\r\nstudies, which have analyzed domestic and nondomestic influences separately, we examine how the\r\ninternal attributes of place `condition' the influence of transnational spatial dependencies. We find that\r\nhigher levels of ISO 14001 certification in other economies are more likely to spill over (via transnational\r\nlinkages) into higher domestic uptake of the standard in wealthier economies, while domestic\r\nreceptivity to the influence of higher GC adoptions abroad is greater in more democratic countries.\r\nAnother important advance on previous studies is that we examine the influence of a larger number of\r\nmeasures of transnational economic linkage. Providing evidence of `trading-up' and `investing-up'\r\ndynamics, we show that higher densities of ISO 14001 certificates and GC participants in a country's\r\nexport and inward foreign direct investment partners are associated with higher levels of domestic\r\nuptake of the respective standard. We also find tentative evidence of `visiting-up' dynamics associated\r\nwith the cross-border movement of businesspeople."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-02-18"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for EPA (ISO14k and GC).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":133647,"dataFile":{"id":3126089,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WLI031/AOKRZM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WLI031/AOKRZM","filename":"Article for EPA (ISO14k and GC).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":2377,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:161a920d884-f3790d520af4","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"89c89dd3ce1aba5db26bf66575d20070","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"89c89dd3ce1aba5db26bf66575d20070"}}},{"label":"Article for EPA (ISO14k and GC).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":133647,"dataFile":{"id":3126088,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WLI031/V2SVB4","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WLI031/V2SVB4","filename":"Article for EPA (ISO14k and GC).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":475405,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:161a920e474-8f599577ad54","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:uIIpcoF46mumF3LBsoyXHg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"bf4c9edfc4d39d371771dc3e26eff50c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"bf4c9edfc4d39d371771dc3e26eff50c"}}}]}}}
