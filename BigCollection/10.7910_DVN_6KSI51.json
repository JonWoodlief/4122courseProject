All of the women were white, between the ages of 27 and 33, and had been divorced not less than a year and a half and not more than two years. Each participant had at least one child living with her and had been divorced only once. All of the working-class participants were part- or full-time students.<br /><br />  An open-ended,\nstructured interview schedule was employed. The three main categories and subsequent areas that were addressed are as follows: 1) the pre-divorce conditions, including the participant's perception of her marriage; her inner strengths; her support system; and her relationship with her husband, children, in-laws, and\nfamily of origin; 2) the divorce, including emotional reaction to the final separation; financial, parenting, and interpersonal concerns; and 3) post-divorce adjustments in the above mentioned realms.\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (12 interview transcripts from the study).
