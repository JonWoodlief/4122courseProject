However, they take time, can be affected by demographic factors, and lack ecological validity. This study explored multi-sensory integration ability to discriminate cognitive dysfunction in cirrhosis. Thirty-two healthy controls and 30 cirrhotic patients were recruited. The sensory integration test presents stimuli from two different modalities (e.g., image/sound) with a short time lag, and subjects judge which stimuli appeared first. Repetitive tests reveal the sensory integration capability. Performance in the sensory integration test, psychometric tests, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy for patients was compared to controls. Sensory integration capability, the perceptual threshold to discriminate the time gap between an image and sound stimulus, was significantly impaired in cirrhotic patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) compared to controls (p<0.01) and non-MHE patients (p<0.01). Sensory integration test showed good correlation with psychometric tests (NCT-A, r=0.383, p=0.002; NCT-B, r=0.450, p<0.01; DST-F, r=-0.322, p=0.011; DST- B, r=-0.384, p=0.002; ACPT, r=-0.467, p<0.01). Psychometric tests were dependent on age and education level, while the sensory integration test was not affected. The sensory integration test, where a cut-off value for the perceptual threshold was 133.3ms, recognized MHE patients at 90% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-10-06"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sensory integration"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Seo, Kyoungwon"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-10-06"}]}},"files":[{"description":"The subjects' demographic characteristics (gender, age, education level), sensory integration test (perceptual threshold), psychometric tests (NCT-A/B, DST, DST-F/B, ACPT), and fNIRS results (from CH1 to CH16) were collected.","label":"Experimental results for sensory integration test.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":129108,"dataFile":{"id":3056030,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/53W4LE/UP1IQR","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/53W4LE/UP1IQR","filename":"Experimental results for sensory integration test.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":8654,"description":"The subjects' demographic characteristics (gender, age, education level), sensory integration test (perceptual threshold), psychometric tests (NCT-A/B, DST, DST-F/B, ACPT), and fNIRS results (from CH1 to CH16) were collected.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15ef0e04f90-2d4ec715ad5e","originalFileFormat":"text/csv","originalFormatLabel":"Comma Separated Values","UNF":"UNF:6:JOtEwjZU7V5ASzXU8RHNQg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"50e994a081aa03bc0826c3f3405acc26","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"50e994a081aa03bc0826c3f3405acc26"}}}]}}}
