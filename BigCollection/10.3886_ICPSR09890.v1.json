Respondents were asked whether they   approved or disapproved of Bush's handling of the presidency and why,   whether the nation's economy could be described as excellent, good,   not so good, or poor, whether they were better off financially than   in 1989 when Bush became president, and whether Bush cared equally   about serving people of all income levels. Concerning political   parties, respondents were asked whether the Democrats or Republicans   could do a better job of coping with the main problems the nation   would face in the coming years and which party could better handle   issues such as the economy, crime, foreign affairs, education,   defense, and health care. Concerning Congress, respondents were asked   whether they approved of the way their own United States   Representative was handling his or her job, whether they approved of   the way Congress in general was doing its job and why, and whether   they approved of the way the Democrats in Congress were handling the   nation's economy. In addition, those surveyed were asked whether Bush   or the Democrats in Congress could be trusted to do a better job on   the economy, whether Bush and the Democrats in Congress were more   interested in doing what's best for the economy or what's best for   themselves politically, and whether the United States needed a new   president that would set the nation in another direction. Respondents   were also asked whether cutting taxes or increasing domestic spending   was more important at the present time, whether their biggest problem   was high taxes, slow income growth, or too much debt, whether it had   become more difficult to get a promotion or a better job in the past   year, whether their hours and overtime had been reduced in the past   year, and if their latest pay raise had been higher or lower than   usual. Concerning the 1992 presidential election, respondents were   asked for whom they would vote if their state held a Democratic or   Republican primary/caucus for president, toward whom they were   leaning for the primary/caucus at the time of the interview, what the   chances were that they would vote in the 1992 presidential election,   whether they would vote for Bush or various other prospective   candidates/nominees were the national election held at the time of   the interview, and toward whom they were leaning for the national   election at the time of the interview. Additionally, respondents were   asked whether they would consider voting for David Duke, whether they   would like to see the 1992 national elections result in a Republican   president with a Democratic majority in Congress or various other   combinations and how important that was, and how much a candidate's   position on health care influenced the respondent's vote. Other   topics included living wills, the cost and availability of health   care, approaches to financing health care, and health benefits   provid\ned by employers. Background information on respondents includes   political alignment, voter registration status, most recent   presidential vote choice, education, age, race, income, economic   class, religion, marital status, household composition, labor union  membership, urban/suburban/rural residence, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush Administration (1989-1993)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George H.W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national defense"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States House of Representatives"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
