All were paid volunteers.\r\n <br /><br />\r\nTests were administered in group settings at the various campuses. White women and African American women were tested separately by examiners of their own race. Four verbal projective cues were administered to elicit FOS imagery. An additional questionnaire was administered to assess basic demographics, dimensions of career choice, and attitudes towards achievement in women. Also included in some questionnaires were an attachment scale, measuring strength of current relationships, and a militancy scale assessing attitudes towards various aspects of militancy among African Americans.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (original paper data records from an additional 120 African American participants, based on an independent study conducted by a master's candidate, are also included in this collection).
