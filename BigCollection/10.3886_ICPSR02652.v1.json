The main analytical strategy of this study  was to determine whether clients who were appropriately matched to  outpatient drug treatment were less likely to recidivate after  treatment in this modality. The focus of the research was not so much  on developing powerful prediction models, but rather on determining  whether outpatient drug treatment was appropriate and effective for  certain types of probationers. The evaluation research involved an  in-depth analysis of a sample of 1,860 probationers who were sentenced  between September 1991-September 1992 and referred to contracting  outpatient drug treatment programs one or more times as of December  31, 1993. The following types of data were collected: (1) the New  York City Department of Probation's demographic and drug use  information, obtained during the presentence investigation and at  intake to probation, (2) the Department of Probation's Central  Placement Unit (CPU) database records for each referral made through  the CPU, as well as monthly progress reports filled out by the  treatment programs on each probationer admitted to drug treatment, (3)  the New York State Department of Criminal Justice Statistics' data on  criminal histories, and (4) probation officers' reports on whether  clients were referred to treatment, the kind of treatment modality to  which they were referred, and the dates of admission and  discharge. Demographic and socioeconomic variables include age at  first arrest and sentencing, gender, race or ethnicity, marital  status, family composition, educational attainment, and employment  status. Other variables include drug use history (e.g., age at which  drugs were first used, if the client's family members used drugs, if  the client was actively using heroin, cocaine, or alcohol at time of  intake into treatment), criminal history (e.g., age at first arrest,  number of arrests, types of crimes, prior convictions, and prior  probation and jail sentences), and drug treatment history (e.g.,  number and types of prior times in drug treatment, months since last  treatment program, number of admissions to a CPU program, and number of AIDS education programs attended)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was undertaken to evaluate the New  York City Department of Probation's initiative to place clients in  specialized Sub\nstance Abuse Verification and Enforcement (SAVE) units  for treatment and management. At the time, probation departments  throughout the country were struggling with large caseloads of  drug-involved offenders. This was especially true in areas such as New  York City, where drug-related arrests had risen sharply and  alternatives to incarceration had been expanded to alleviate  overcrowding in jails and prisons. Many community corrections agencies  had established specialized or intensive drug supervision units that  monitored clients' drug use with urine testing and referred those who  tested positive to drug treatment programs. In 1989, the New York City  Department of Probation established Substance Abuse Verification and  Enforcement (SAVE) units. These specialized units were created to  provide closer supervision of high-risk cocaine-abusing probationers  by having lower caseloads than regular units and by developing  stronger linkages with community-based drug treatment programs. In  1991, the department created a Central Placement Unit (CPU), which  contracted with nine outpatient drug-free treatment programs for  treatment slots. Referrals were made through the CPU, which operated  like an 800-number reservation service that probation officers could  call in order to place clients in contracting treatment programs. The  main analytical strategy of this study was to determine whether  clients who were appropriately matched to outpatient drug treatment  were less likely to recidivate after treatment in this modality. The  focus of the research was not so much on developing powerful  prediction models, but rather on determining whether outpatient drug  treatment was appropriate and effective for certain types of  probationers. The study aimed to answer the question: Is outpatient  drug treatment capable of reducing recidivism among a significant number of probationers?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The evaluation research involved an in-depth  analysis of a sample of 1,860 probationers who were sentenced between  September 1991 and September 1992 and referred to contracting  outpatient drug treatment programs one or more times as of December  31, 1993.
