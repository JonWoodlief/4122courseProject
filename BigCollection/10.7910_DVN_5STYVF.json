It includes accelerometer data from 617 children who contributed a total of 1314 participant-weeks of valid data after processing. The detailed description of each column is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. participant_week_index. Because we are considering participant week as our basic analysis object, so each participant week is assigned with a unique index.\r\n\r\n2. datetime. The time is at the minute level.\r\n\r\n3. time_class. There are 3 types of time in our study which are:\r\n    3.1. time class [1] represents school time. 09:15 am to 15:00 pm from Monday to Friday.\r\n    3.2. time class [2] represents leisure time. 06:00am to 09:15am and 15:00pm to 22:00pm from Monday to Friday, and 06:00am to 22:00pm on Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\n    3.3. time class [3] represents other time.\r\n\r\n4. counts_per_minute. The accelerometer data were collected at 100 Hz epochs and reduced to vector magnitude (VM) with a 1-second epoch using ActiLife 6 data analysis software. Further, the VM within a minute is accumulated to get counts_per_minute.\r\n\r\n5. wear_and_awake. There are 2 values:\r\n    5.1. value [0] represents that the participant is sleeping or doesn't wear the device. \r\n    5.2. value [1] represents the participant is awake and wear the device.\r\n\r\n6. activity_level. There are 4 types under standard threshold:\r\n    6.1. N/A represents \"not applicable\". Because we only consider the accelerometer data during leisure hours, the activity level will be labeled as N/A if the time is not in leisure hours.\r\n    6.2. SED if CPM <= 150.\r\n    6.3. LPA if CPM is in (150, 1951]\r\n    6.4. MVPA if CPM > 1951"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-10-24"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Computer and Information Science","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Fuller, Daniel"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-10-24"}]}},"files":[{"label":"kids_accelerometer_data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":145701,"dataFile":{"id":3246508,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5STYVF/AD6OJU","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5STYVF/AD6OJU","filename":"kids_accelerometer_data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":283810254,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166a871dc08-5ff2f511e717","originalFileFormat":"text/csv","originalFormatLabel":"Comma Separated Values","UNF":"UNF:6:NZqD7ttU4aQOiBuMfHkrdw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d3d31d5937bdfef6ceb4dc003da01d40","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d3d31d5937bdfef6ceb4dc003da01d40"}}}]}}}
