Sediment and individuals of Corbicula fluminea were collected in the oligohaline upper reaches of the Mondego Estuary, Portugal (40° 9'47.91\"N, 8°40'12.42\"W) from a tidally influenced location. A laboratorial experiment was run for 6 days and included all possible permutations of three different size classes of Corbicula fluminea, with fixed biomass achieved through density adjustment (18.79 ± 0.94 g aquaria-1 wet biomass: small, measuring <1cm, ~1 year old, 13 ind. aquaria-1 (= 902 ind m-2); medium 2-2.5 cm, ~ 2 years old, 2 ind. aquaria-1 (= 138 ind. m-2); large > 3 cm, > 3 years old, 1 ind. aquaria-1 (= 69 ind m-2) at levels representative of the population at study site. These size classes were crossed with two levels of salinity (freshwater, 0, and oligohaline, 5) and two levels of temperature (24ºC and 30ºC) in glass aquaria (12 x 12 x 35 cm, internal dimensions). Each aquaria contained sediment ~10 cm depth overlain with water to 30 cm depth. Temperature approximated summer water temperatures at the study site (24oC), or extreme heat-wave conditions (30oC). Treatments representative of the natural habitat for C. fluminea (salinity, 0) contrasted to treatments (salinity, 5) representing either the estuarine gradient (e.g. 4.6 ± 3.1 in the mesohaline areas during flood events) or areas of the estuary prone to drought events. All aquaria were continually aerated and maintained under natural daylight conditions for a period of 6 days. Salinity, temperature, pH and oxygen levels (O2) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The extent of particle reworking – the passive and active displacement of sediment particles by the activity of macrofaunal organisms - was measured non-invasively using fluorescent sediment profile imaging (f-SPI) After 6 days, water column nutrient concentrations (NH3-N, NO3-N, PO4-P) as well information on particle reworking (mean (Lummean), median (Lummedian) and maximum (Lummax) mixed depth of particle redistribution, and surface boundary roughness (SBR)) were assessed, which are included in the present dataset. The data were collected as part of the Biochanged project (PTDC/MAR/111901/2009) Supported by FCT (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology), subsidized by the European Social Fund and MCTES (Portuguese Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education), through the POPH (Human Potential Operational Programme), QREN (National Strategic Reference Framework) and COMPETE (Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade)."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-10-30"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Earth and Environmental Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"coastal transition zone"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ecosystem functioning"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"invasive species"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"non-indigenous species"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"refugia"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"warming"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Crespo, Daniel"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-10-31"}]}},"files":[{"description":"(Metadata) Replication Data for: Ecological consequences of invasion across the freshwater-marine transition in a warming world","label":"crespo_et_al2017_metadata.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":130248,"dataFile":{"id":3072144,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/3ITBSH/YG0HDW","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/3ITBSH/YG0HDW","filename":"crespo_et_al2017_metadata.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":499452,"description":"(Metadata) Replication Data for: Ecological consequences of invasion across the freshwater-marine transition in a warming world","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f74979d6c-2338c0cdfdf2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ed31aeb29ff3a223719258e6a0600ad5","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ed31aeb29ff3a223719258e6a0600ad5"}}},{"description":"Replication Data for: Ecological consequences of invasion across the freshwater-marine transition in a warming world","label":"crespo_etal_data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":130248,"dataFile":{"id":3072143,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/3ITBSH/UZBIXF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/3ITBSH/UZBIXF","filename":"crespo_etal_data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":2681,"description":"Replication Data for: Ecological consequences of invasion across the freshwater-marine transition in a warming world","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f7495a67d-a280ed762de6","originalFileFormat":"text/csv","originalFormatLabel":"Comma Separated Values","UNF":"UNF:6:nZj2qGKNZMJu56IhH70j9w==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d3d81f1c6f5d09cd8918c1e4d69084f2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d3d81f1c6f5d09cd8918c1e4d69084f2"}}}]}}}
