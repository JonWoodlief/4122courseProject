The election studies are designed to present data on Americans' social backgrounds, enduring political predispositions, social and political values, perceptions and evaluations of groups and candidates, opinions on questions of public policy, and participation in political life. The 2002 American National Election Study (ANES) is the first mid-year study to include a pre-election in addition to post-election interview. It is also the first NES study conducted entirely by telephone. Since NES questions are generally designed for face-to-face interviewing, a number of time-series questions were modified to enhance the validity and reliability of data obtained through telephone interviews. Special content for 2002 includes questions on the terrorist attacks of 2001 (and presidential and military response to the attacks), the election contest of 2000, and special modules on economic inequality, specifically gender and racial differences in jobs and income inequality. In a continuation of past topics, respondents were asked about their choice for president, the United States House of Representatives, and the United States Senate. Respondents were also queried about their approval of Bush's handling of the presidency, the economy, and foreign relations. Questions also included feeling thermometers on the United States Congress, the military, the federal government, political figures (George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Al Gore, Joseph Lieberman, Ralph Nader, Bill Clinton, Colin Powell, John Ashcroft, Jesse Jackson, Laura Bush, and Hillary Clinton), and political constituencies (such as Blacks, Whites, conservatives, liberals, big business, people on welfare, Hispanics, Christian fundamentalists, older people, environmentalists, gay men and lesbians, and the news media). The NES 2002 also contained questions on the subject of social trust, such as whether the respondent thought most people would take advantage of you if they had the chance or if they would try to be fair, and whether people try to be helpful or if they are just looking out for themselves. Questions about civic engagement included whether the respondent had worked with other people to deal with an issue facing the community, communicated\nwith a government official to express views, or taken part in a protest, march, or demonstration during the last 12 months. Respondents were asked about political participation, such as whether they registered to vote, had voted, tried to influence how others voted, watched the campaign on television, and whether they were contacted by either major party. Questions about public opinion included whether the government should see to it that every person has a job and a good standard of living and whether the United States should concern itself with world problems. Additional public opinion questions asked whether the respondent thought the economy had gotten better or worse in the past year and whether the respondent was better or worse off financially than he or she was a year ago. A range of questions was posed regarding tax cuts in general and the 2001 tax cuts in particular. Topics also included religious beliefs and participation, pride and shame in being American, and corporate scandals. Demographic variables include age, marital status, education level, employment status, household income, racial/ethnic background, religious preference, home ownership, and length of residency in community. The Auxiliary Data File (Part 2) contains contextual variables for the 2002 National Election Study. Biographical variables for the Democratic and Republican candidates and retiring incumbents include candidate's gender, race, educational background, and committee membership. Incumbent president and party support are also included."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen
