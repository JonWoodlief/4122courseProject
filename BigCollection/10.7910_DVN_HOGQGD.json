The authors confront his hypotheses with ones\r\nderived from the strategic logic of international terrorism. They predict more terrorism against nationals\r\nfrom countries whose governments support the government of the terrorists’ home country. Like\r\nHuntington, they also predict excessive terrorism on Western targets, not because of inter-civilizational\r\nconflict per se, but because of the strategic value of Western targets. Contra Huntington, their theory does\r\nnot suggest that Islamic civilization groups commit more terrorist acts against nationals from other\r\ncivilizations in general, nor a general increase in inter-civilizational terrorism after the Cold War. The\r\nempirical analysis – based on estimations in a directed dyadic country sample, 1969–2005 – broadly\r\nsupports their theory. In particular, there is not significantly more terrorism from the Islamic against other\r\ncivilizations in general, nor a structural break in the pattern of international terrorism after the Cold War"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-10"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for BJPS (Huntington).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79173,"dataFile":{"id":2772482,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/HOGQGD/ADBVCF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HOGQGD/ADBVCF","filename":"Article for BJPS (Huntington).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":33842,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1522b203e49-5367fd1cb72a","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"eb57acfd139ae5f654fe960e88964f75","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"eb57acfd139ae5f654fe960e88964f75"}}},{"description":"Data in zipped format","label":"Article for BJPS (Huntington).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79173,"dataFile":{"id":2772483,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/HOGQGD/NQCXCB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HOGQGD/NQCXCB","filename":"Article for BJPS (Huntington).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":280377439,"description":"Data in zipped format","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1522b22689b-3bbbf701a588","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:+1o5BgdZzpChtRCQebYGpA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"448aab7771137c28016e302ae5568a13","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"448aab7771137c28016e302ae5568a13"}}}]}}}
