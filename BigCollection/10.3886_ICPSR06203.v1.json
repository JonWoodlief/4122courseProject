Respondents were questioned regarding David Dinkins' handling   of his job as mayor, their opinions of mayoral candidates David   Dinkins, Rudolph Giuliani, Roy Innis, Andrew Stein, and Herman Badillo,   their level of satisfaction with the mayoral candidates, whom they   intended to vote for in the mayoral election, and whether Ed Koch's   endorsement of a mayoral candidate would make a difference in how they   voted. With the departure of Herman Badillo from the mayoral race,   respondents were asked if Badillo's possible bid for comptroller and   support of Giuliani's candidacy would influence their support for   Giuliani. Those surveyed were also asked whether the candidates had   strong leadership qualities, whether race relations would improve with   the election of Dinkins, Giuliani, or Stein, whether Dinkins was tough   enough to deal with th\ne crime problem in New York City, and which of   the problems facing New York City the next mayor should concentrate   most on. Respondents' opinions regarding life in New York City was   gauged by items inquiring whether life had improved in the last four   years, whether race relations were generally good, whether the police   treated both whites and Blacks fairly, whether the city and the   respondents' neighborhoods were more safe than four years ago, and   whether the city and the respondents' neighborhoods would be better   places to live 10-15 years from now. Additional questions dealt with   the New York City police department, the New York City city council,   the distribution of condoms in New York City public high schools, the   quality of public schools in New York City, homosexuals and   homosexuality, the firing of the New York City Schools Chancellor   Joseph Fernandez, immigrants, Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic   church, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Al Sharpton.
