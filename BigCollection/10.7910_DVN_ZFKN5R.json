Feedback that included potential solutions was identified in a grounded theory-based approach and coded into the following 7 categories: issues related to specific teaching modalities used in courses, the overall course content, specific lectures (content and organization), sequencing of course events, administrative course components, exams, and study materials. Open-ended comments from online questionnaires were analyzed for the same 9 preclerkship courses for second-year medical students. In these online questionnaires, a 20-item Likert-style survey was followed by a request for comments related to the course. The survey was administered after the end of each course and 714 deidentified responses from second-year medical students were collected. The overall response rate of the online questionnaires was 66%. A total of 293 comments from the online questionnaires of the 9 preclerkship courses were analyzed. Online comments corresponding to SET meeting comments were identified."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cho, A Ra"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-10-29"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Jeehp_15_25_raw data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":145937,"dataFile":{"id":3298474,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/ZFKN5R/AVITST","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZFKN5R/AVITST","filename":"Jeehp_15_25_raw data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":670,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166be227a22-834a9b95c109","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:OGssjo8HEkf55XcfafP+XQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fe7a80a1d59f6299ea2fa0c881184765","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fe7a80a1d59f6299ea2fa0c881184765"}}}]}}}
