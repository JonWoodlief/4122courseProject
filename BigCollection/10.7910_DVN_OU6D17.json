A predominant approach has been to use linear structural equation models and examine the statistical significance of corresponding path coefficients. However, this approach implicitly assumes that the multiple mechanisms are causally independent of one another. In this paper, we consider a set of alternative assumptions that are sufficient to identify the average causal mediation effects when multiple, causally related mediators exist. We develop a new sensitivity analysis for examining the robustness of empirical findings to the potential violation of a key identification assumption.  We apply the proposed methods to three political psychology experiments which examine alternative causal pathways between media framing and public opinion.  Our analysis reveals that the validity of original conclusions is highly reliant on the assumed independence of alternative causal mechanisms, highlighting the importance of proposed sensitivity analysis."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Imai, Kosuke and Teppei Yamamoto, \"Identification and Sensitivity Analysis for Multiple Causal Mechanisms: Revisiting Evidence from Framing Experiments,\" Political Analysis, Forthcoming."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-10-22"}]}},"files":[{"description":"R code for replication Figures 2 and 3 and diagnostics reported in Section 4","label":"fig2and3.R","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51794,"categories":["Code"],"dataFile":{"id":2424281,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"fig2and3.R","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":19641,"description":"R code for replication Figures 2 and 3 and diagnostics reported in Section 4","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:92312","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"69f5a90ae45add6c83f465fd52092d65","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"69f5a90ae45add6c83f465fd52092d65"}}},{"description":"Data from the three experiments analyzed in the paper","label":"PA-ImaiYamamoto.RData","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51794,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2424280,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"PA-ImaiYamamoto.RData","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":9969,"description":"Data from the three experiments analyzed in the paper","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:92311","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5fba13e289538f6b1a842dc3133c16f8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5fba13e289538f6b1a842dc3133c16f8"}}},{"description":"","label":"readme.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51794,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":2424282,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"readme.txt","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":998,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:92313","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"86fafeceb47ae40d9331603bed3f40b0","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"86fafeceb47ae40d9331603bed3f40b0"}}}]}}}
