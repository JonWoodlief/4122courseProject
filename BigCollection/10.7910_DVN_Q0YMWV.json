All study documentation and data can be freely downloaded. I believe easy access to data for secondary use pushes forward the research agenda while reducing expensive duplication, but not everyone believes the same.  To help me and others make the case and increase access, you could simply send a quick e-mail to Eizabeth Pisani mentioning why you are interested in the data, how you discovered it, and how you're thinking of using either the data or the documentation. A LOT of work went in to the collection and documentation of these data. It would seem both fair and honorable if you post analysis files back to the site in a publicly accessible form (if in doubt, e-mail them to Elizabeth). If the data are transformed or combined with data from other sources, the transformed data should be posted on the same terms as the original data set. Thanks for working together towards Open Science.","metadataBlocks":{"citation":{"displayName":"Citation Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"title","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Behavioural and drug-taking risk behaviour among female sex workers and men in mobile occupations in Indonesia, 2002-2004"},{"typeName":"author","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Republic of Indonesia, Ministry of Health"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Republic of Indonesia, Ministry of Health"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Statistics Indonesia"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Statistics Indonesia"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family Health International"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family Health International"}}]},{"typeName":"datasetContact","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"datasetContactEmail":{"typeName":"datasetContactEmail","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"N/A"}}]},{"typeName":"dsDescription","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Indonesia has monitored behaviours that carry a high risk for HIV infection in groups most likely to be affected since 1996. The behavioural sentinel surveillance was originally carried out by the University of Indonesia, with the support of Family Health International under a grant provided by USAID. In 2002, the system was taken over by a team led by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. Surveys were implemented by the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics with the help of NGOs and with technical support from Family Health International, and funded by USAID under a memorandum of understanding which explicitly allows data to be made available for the purposes of planning and evaluating HIV-related interventions.  Two rounds of surveillance were carried out under this MOU. In 2002/2003, the team covered only female sex workers and groups of highly mobile men (10 cities). Surveys among male and transgender sex workers, gay men and drug injectors were carried out by University of Indonesia/FHI. In 2004, the government team covered all groups, with data from 15 cities.  Variables cover demographic details, sexual and drug taking behaviour, knowledge of HIV, risk perception, contact with HIV prevention and STI care services and use of services.  Users particularly interested in data from other groups, including male and transgender sex workers, gay men and drug injectors may contact the owner of this Dataverse.
