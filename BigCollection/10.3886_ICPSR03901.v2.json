The Census Quality Survey (CQS) was a nationally representative sample of about 55,000 households. Responding to a mailback questionnaire, one-half of th\ne sample household respondents were asked to \"mark one race,\" and during a telephone recontact, these respondents were asked to \"select one or more races.\" For the other half of the sample households, the reverse procedure was used. Data from these two contacts may be used to produce \"bridging parameters\" to compare race distributions collected under methodologies that request either one race or one or more races. In addition, Census 2000 records were matched to their respective CQS records (with a match success rate of 86 percent). The matched records may also be used to produce bridging estimates."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census methods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR I.A.4.
