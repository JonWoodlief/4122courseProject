Because astronomy and astrophysics are fast-moving fields (terms such as 'exoplanets' and 'dark energy' were relatively unknown 10 years ago), the poster will also describe the ways tha\nt the UAT will leverage expertise from astronomers, physicists and librarians to keep the thesaurus both current and accurate.\n<br /><br /> One of the primary drivers behind the creation of the UAT is the wish to support semantic enrichment of astronomy literature and databases.  We anticipate it will be used as a common language across publishers and platforms, to connect articles and data sets.  We also hope this unified vocabulary will inspire a new range of cross-silo data sharing. <br /><br /> The UAT began as a collaboration between the American Institute of Physics (AIP) and Institute of Physics (IOP), which dona\nted their collection astronomy of terms to the AAS.  SPIE has also donated their astronomy terms towards the effort. Our plans include providing a community-supported mechanism for reviewing, discussing, and evaluating the continuous evolution of terminology in astronomy and astrophysics.\n<br /><br /> See <a href=\"http://astrothesaurus.org/\">http://astrothesaurus.org/</a> for more information."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-06-07"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Presentation given by Alberto Accomazzi (NASA Astrophysics Data System, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) at the IVOA InterOp meeting in Heidelberg, May 15 2013.","label":"Current State of UAT May 15 2013.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":69408,"categories":["Presentation"],"dataFile":{"id":2439683,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Current State of UAT May 15 2013.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":98569,"description":"Presentation given by Alberto Accomazzi (NASA Astrophysics Data System, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) at the IVOA InterOp meeting in Heidelberg, May 15 2013.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:852","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"19e308104f858db2e9c3e5b58c6e75be","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"19e308104f858db2e9c3e5b58c6e75be"}}},{"description":"RDF file of the UAT.","label":"export_skos-xl_04092014115052.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":69408,"categories":["RDF"],"dataFile":{"id":2499185,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"export_skos-xl_04092014115052.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":154493,"description":"RDF file of the UAT.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:232666","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"10e00ea24b153eb0d3485b7083b35f78","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"10e00ea24b153eb0d3485b7083b35f78"}}},{"description":"Rough comparison of the UAT with IVOA thesaurus, SPIE astronomy terms, astronomy journal keywords, and PACS.","label":"UAT Comparison.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":69408,"categories":["Excel"],"dataFile":{"id":2439678,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"UAT Comparison.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":1006080,"description":"Rough comparison of the UAT with IVOA thesaurus, SPIE astronomy terms, astronomy journal keywords, and PACS.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:847","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9b1c7030d1a62cbf9203f881b8f86554","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9b1c7030d1a62cbf9203f881b8f86554"}}},{"description":"UAT hierarchy in a flatfile CSV.","label":"UAT_flatfile_2014_0904_173403.csv","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":69408,"categories":["CSV"],"dataFile":{"id":2499184,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"UAT_flatfile_2014_0904_173403.csv","contentType":"text/plain; charset=UTF-8","filesize":337094,"description":"UAT hierarchy in a flatfile CSV.
