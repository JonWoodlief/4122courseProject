The survey participants consisted of 40 of the 42 pediatric residents at Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA (14 of the 14 first-year residents, 13 of the 14 second-year residents, and 13 of the 14 third-year residents). The 2 missing residents were excluded by chance (scheduled vacation or off day). Surveys were administered during residents’ morning report time slot during the July 2016 to July 2017 training year. The participants completed the Attitudes and Experiences in School Health Collaboration survey. This survey consisted of 9 total items and took approximately 6 minutes to complete. Data were analyzed descriptively to evaluate how often the participants endorsed the 4-point Likert-type scale items pertaining to attitudes and the items pertaining to experiences in school health collaboration."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cho, A Ra"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-02-05"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Jeehp-15-3 _January 29_raw data.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":133146,"dataFile":{"id":3122177,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/7FC9XY/D1YI0Z","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/7FC9XY/D1YI0Z","filename":"Jeehp-15-3 _January 29_raw data.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":14222,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:161688df63d-7088950d875e","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"32d4f8739c63221b427a0e7fd1678517","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"32d4f8739c63221b427a0e7fd1678517"}}}]}}}
