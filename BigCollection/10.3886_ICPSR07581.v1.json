The  package's major purpose is to enable students to examine certain  substantive questions about electoral behavior through analysis of  political survey data. The manual avoids instruction in methodology,  per se, hence the student is taken no further than the analysis of  straightforward variables in percentagized tables with and without  controls, and is introduced to epsilon, the percentage difference  measures based on 2 X 2 tables, but offered no elaborate discussion of  measures of association. The six structured exercises introduce the  basic analytic techniques necessary for coping with survey data in the  expectation that the students will then move on to their own  topics. The datasets were designed to be both substantively and  analytically interesting, as students are forced continually to make  choices and judgments about which variables to use and how to combine  code categories. Beyond this, the exercises serve a more complex  purpose: to help the student gain a better understanding of the  existing scholarly literature by going through steps similar to those  of the original analysts. In some instances, the students can readily  appreciate how close their work is to the analysis in assigned  reading. The instructor's guide has two purposes: first, to help  instructors use the student manual effectively, and second, to suggest  various ways to depart from the six exercises and to develop  essentially new manuals. The subsets (Parts 1-4) contain data from  every presidential election survey that was conducted by the Survey  Research Center (SRC) and Center for Political Studies (CPS) (at the  University of Michigan) from 1952 to 1980. Part 4 contains an  extensive set of variables drawn exclusively from the CPS's AMERICAN  NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1980 (ICPSR 7763). This is the only deck  needed to complete the exercises in Exercises l-5. Part 1 includes  small sets of comparable variables from each SRC/CPS presidential  election study from 1952-1972. The variables in these decks were  selected with the intention of providing students with a range of  interesting possibilities for original research topics for term  papers. Part 2 includes variables and respondents from panel surveys  contained in AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION SERIES: 1972, 1974, 1976  (ICPSR 7607). This dataset may be used with Exercise 6. Supplementing  the panel file is the data in Part 3, based on the cross-section  survey, AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1976 (7381). It repeats the  variables from the 1976 component of the panel, with a much larger  N. The AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1976 (7381) may be used  independently, as with the AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1980  (ICPSR 7763), or it may be used in exercises comparing cross-section  with panel data. Data used for the exercises were made available by  ICPSR. The major analyses of these data have appeared in two  publications: (1) University of Michigan. Survey Research Center. THE  AMERICAN VOTER. New York, NY: Wiley, 1960, and (2) Campbell, Angus,  Philip Converse, Warren Miller, and Donald Stokes. ELECTIONS AND THE POLITICAL ORDER.
