They have a positive impact, both at the microeconomic level, like for the welfare of the household, and at the macroeconomic level, like in the growth of the domestic economy. Remittances are current transfers in cash or in other forms or money received by resident households from non-resident households.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this paper is to discover the impact of remittances on the welfare of the household in the Prizren region. For this reason, an online questionnaire with 160 participants was conducted by selecting the non-random sampling method. According to the results obtained, remittances play an important role in the households of the Prizren region because most of these remittances are used for food consumption, education and clothing. At the end of hypothesis testing it is found that there is an important relationship between the residence and the frequency of receiving remittances, and people living in both, urban and rural areas receive remittance in different frequencies. However, no significant relationship has been found between the gender and frequency of receiving remittances. The research mainly has a descriptive nature of the effect of remittances on households."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-08-31"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Journal, Prizren"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-04"}]}},"files":[{"label":"1.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":140951,"dataFile":{"id":3213584,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/0CAXVV/EFR9SZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0CAXVV/EFR9SZ","filename":"1.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":317332,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165a558aa58-72d9dec80af7","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"08c85bfa7f6f735722bdaa3ce9fb398e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"08c85bfa7f6f735722bdaa3ce9fb398e"}}}]}}}
