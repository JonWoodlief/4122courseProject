The data explored \"minority consciousness\" among women and  investigated how this group-shared consciousness affected women's  orientation toward the political system as well as toward each  other. Variables designed to measure minority consciousness include  respondents' views on the existence of societal, work-related, and  domestic sex discrimination, attitudes regarding such discrimination,  and the extent to which women identify with other women. Variables  regarding personal experiences with sex discrimination and sexual  harassment are also included. Other questions explored attitudes  toward recent changes in women's status, responsibility for both past  and future changes in status, and the effect of such changes on the  respondent's own life. Additional information was gathered on the role  of the government in bringing about change in the status of  women. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education,  religion, marital status, number of and ages of children, occupation,  and family and personal income, as well as political party identification and ideology."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"men"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"minorities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"perceptions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sex discrimination"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"women"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.H.
