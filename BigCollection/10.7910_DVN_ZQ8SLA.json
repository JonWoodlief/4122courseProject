Using new data from 180 gubernatorial and Senate elections from 1989 to 2006, this paper presents the first large-sample test of the Wilder effect. It demonstrates a significant Wilder effect only through the early 1990s, when Wilder himself was Governor of Virginia. Evidence from the 2008 presidential election reinforces this claim. Although the same mechanisms could affect female candidates, this paper finds no such effect at any point in time. It also shows how polls’ over-estimation of front-runners’ support can exaggerate estimates of the Wilder effect. Together, these results accord with theories emphasizing how short-term changes in the political context influence the role of race in statewide elections. The Wilder effect is the product of racial attitudes in specific political contexts, not a more general response to under-represented groups."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-12-18"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hopkins, Daniel J., \"No More Wilder Effect, Never a Whitman Effect: When and Why Polls Mislead about Black and Female Candidates,\" Journal of Politics 71(3), 2009:<a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~dhopkins/wilder13.pdf\" target= \"_new\">article available here</a>."}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-12"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Murray Research Archive"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://murray.harvard.edu/files/murray/banner146x48.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-12-18"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-06-22"}]}},"files":[{"description":"this comma-separated data set provides polling and election outcome data for female and African American candidates running for U.S. Senate or Governor between 1989 and 2006","label":"candidates1A.csv","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":44810,"categories":["2.
