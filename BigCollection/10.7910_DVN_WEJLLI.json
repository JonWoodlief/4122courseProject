Specifically, Hoffman examined whether fear of success and need for achievement scores changed over time in this sample, and also the degree to which the original 1965 fear of success scores predicted subsequent behavior--such as marriage, motherhood, career, and pursuit of further education.\r\n<br /><br />  In 1974 questionnaires were mailed to all 177 original participants (89 women and 88 men, most of whom were freshmen in 1965); a total of 72 men and 86 women returned completed questionnaires.<br /><br />  The questionnaire contained both open-ended and precoded questions about life events since 1965, including demographic information, education and work histories, family background, and family status. Participants also answered questions about their attitudes toward work, marriage, childbearing, sex roles, and the external events which they felt had affected their attitudes. Also included in the questionnaire packet were six projective story cues.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds numeric data files, and original record paper data from this study.
