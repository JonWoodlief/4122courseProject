As suggested by Loureiro & Boldyrev 2017 and Mallet et al. 2017, below a certain critical thickness $\\lambda_c$ such current sheets become tearing-unstable. We propose that the tearing instability changes the effective alignment of the magnetic field lines in such a way as to balance the eddy turnover rate at all scales smaller than $\\lambda_c$. As a result, turbulent fluctuations become progressively less anisotropic at smaller scales, with the alignment angle increasing as $\\theta \\sim (\\lambda/\\lambda_*)^{-4/5+\\beta}$, where $\\lambda_*\\sim L_0 S_0^{-3/4}$ is the resistive dissipation scale. Here $L_0$ is the outer scale of the turbulence, $S_0$ is the corresponding Lundquist number, and {$0\\leq \\beta <4/5$} is a parameter. The resulting Fourier energy spectrum is $E(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-11/5+2\\beta/3}$, where $k_\\perp$ is the wavenumber normal to the local mean magnetic field, and the critical scale is $\\lambda_c\\sim S_L^{-(4-5\\beta)/(7-{20\\beta/3})}$. The simplest model corresponds to $\\beta=0$, in which case the predicted scaling formally agrees with one of the solutions obtained in (Mallet et al. 2017) from a discrete hierarchical model of abruptly collapsing current sheets, an approach different and complementary to ours. We also show that the reconnection-mediated interval is non-universal with respect to the dissipation mechanism. Hyper-resistivity of the form ${\\tilde \\eta}k^{2+2s}$ leads (in the simplest case of $\\beta=0$) to the different transition scale $\\lambda_c\\sim L_0{\\tilde S}_0^{-4/(7+9s)}$ and the energy spectrum $E(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-(11+9s)/(5+3s)}$, where ${\\tilde S}_0$ is the corresponding hyper-resistive Lundquist number."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"magnetic reconnection"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"magnetohydrodynamics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MHD"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"theory"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"turbulence"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/17ja/17ja029/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-17-29</a><br /><br />NFL was supported by the NSF-DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering, award no DE-SC0016215."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"17ja029_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149404,"dataFile":{"id":3343191,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"17ja029_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":166710,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168395d237e-8bad229ee3ae","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"64c5a0e36899f323f2255976ecf28362","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"64c5a0e36899f323f2255976ecf28362"}}}]}}}
