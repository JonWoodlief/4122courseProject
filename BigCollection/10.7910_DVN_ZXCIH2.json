This paper investigates the core factors that can influence satisfaction level of tourists with specific reference to tourism industry in Bangladesh.   Satisfied tourists will revisit the place and they will provide positive word-of-mouth. So it is indispensable to identify which factors around the tour destinations have impact on overall satisfaction of tourists. In carrying out this research, primary data have been collected from 428 tourists of different tourism spots in Sylhet region using structured questionnaire. It is found in the study that the touristsâ€™ satisfaction greatly depends on natural beauty,  transportation and accommodation facilities, safety and security, and costs. This study reveals that tourist satisfaction depends on a complex process where the role of every actor is fundamental and those actors should be harmonized with each other. Furthermore, this study allows identifying the current strengths and weaknesses of tourism services in Sylhet which may reflect the overall scenario of Bangladesh.
