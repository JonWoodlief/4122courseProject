A consortium of municipal, county, state, and  federal law enforcement agencies developed the program, which stressed  user accountability. The Demand Reduction Program had two objectives:  (1) to create community-wide awareness of the severity of the drug  problem and to alert drug users to the increased risk of legal  sanctions, and (2) to adopt a zero-tolerance position of user  accountability through an emphasis on increased and coordinated law  enforcement activities directed against individual offenders and  special treatment programs in lieu of prosecution. Part 1 of the  collection, Demand Reduction Program Data, provides information on  prosecutor's disposition, arrest date, submitted charges, filed  charges, prior charges, disposition of charges, drugs offender used in  last three months, information on prior drug treatment, type of  attorney, and arrestee's age at arrest, sex, marital status, income,  and living arrangement. Part 2 is a Citizen Survey conducted in  January 1990, ten months after the implementation of the Demand  Reduction Program. Adult residents of Maricopa County were asked in  telephone interviews about their attitudes toward drug use, tax  support for drug treatment, education, and punishment, their knowledge  of the Demand Reduction Program, and demographic information. Parts 3  and 4 supply data from surveys of Maricopa County police officers,  conducted in March 1990 and April 1991, to measure attitudes regarding  the Demand Reduction Program with respect to (1) police effort, (2)  inter-agency cooperation, (3) the harm involved in drug use, and (4)  support for diversion to treatment. The two police surveys contained  identically-worded questions, with only a small number of different  questions asked the second year. Variables include officer's rank,  years at rank, years in department, shift worked, age, sex, ethnicity,  education, marital status, if officer was the primary or secondary  wage earner, officer's perception of and training for the Demand  Reduction Program, and personal attitudes toward drug use. Part 5  provides arrest data from the Maricopa County Task Force, which  arrested drug users through two methods: (1) sweeps of public and  semi-public places, and (2) \"reversals,\" where drug sellers were  arrested and replaced by police officers posing as drug sellers, who  then arrested the drug buyers.

The Demand Reduction Program was characterized by five features: (1) a  comprehensive program integrating education, law enforcement, and  treatment into a unified campaign against casual drug use, (2) the  complete participation of all law enforcement agencies within the  scope of the Demand Reduction Program, (3) a high level of community  support, including local media and private sector donations of time,  equipment, and materials for the program's advertising campaign, (4)  tough laws which classified any illicit drug use as a felony, and (5)  revenues generated from fees collected from offenders who entered the  diversionary treatment program, based on the type of drug and the  offender's ability to pay. A major goal of the Demand Reduction  Program was to educate the general population and private sector  employers about the harmfulness of drug use and to stress that those  who used drugs would be held legally accountable. Another goal was to  focus on the arrest, prosecution, and possible diversionary treatment  of drug offenders. As a general rule, diversion to treatment was  offered only to casual users with no prior criminal history. Eligible individuals could refuse to enter the treatment program."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were compiled from four sources: (1) Arrest  data from the Demand Reduction Program. (2) Arrest data from the  Maricopa County Task Force, which arrested drug users through sweeps  of public and semi-public places, and through \"reversals,\" where  drug sellers were arrested and replaced by police officers posing as  drug sellers, who then arrested the drug buyers. Task Force operations  occurred at a rate of more than one a month and were geographically  dispersed. On two occasions, the Task Force served warrants on  outstanding cases, leading to 31 arrests. During the study's time  period, the Task Force conducted 38 operations, producing a total of  730 arrests. (3) Adult residents of Maricopa County were surveyed to  determine their attitudes toward drug use and to assess how their  attitudes coincided with the philosophy, procedures, and goals of the  Demand Reduction Program. The Citizen Survey was conducted in January  1990, ten months after the implementation of the Demand Reduction  Program. A total of 393 adult residents of Maricopa County were asked  about their attitudes toward drug use, tax support for drug treatment,  education, and punishment, their knowledge of the Demand Reduction  Program, and demographic information. (4) Approximately one year after  the program's implementation, in March 1990, Maricopa County police  officers were surveyed to gauge their perceptions of their training  for the Demand Reduction Program and the amount of police effort and  cooperation involved as well as their personal attitudes concerning  drug use and their support for the program. The survey of police  officers was repeated 13 months later, in April 1991. The two police  surveys were identical except for two variables in the second survey  concerning participation in the first survey. A quasi-experimental  research design was used, employing repeated observations over time to  assess the impact of the Demand Reduction Program on factors such as  the volume of arrests, the percentage of cases formally booked, the  proportion of cases accepted for prosecution, the use of deferred  prosecution, and prosecution outcomes. Additional Task Force data were  collected specific to the Task Force operation which resulted in the indi\nvidual's arrest."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1: The Demand Reduction Program data provide  information on prosecutor's disposition, arrest date, submitted  charges, filed charges, prior charges, disposition of charges, drugs  used in last three months, information on prior drug treatment, type  of attorney, and arrestee's age at arrest, sex, marital status,  income, and living arrangement.
