The project comprised a household survey conducted during November and December 1996. The complete survey covered at least 6 500 households across the province of KwaZulu-Natal. It followed a pilot study of perceptions of development conducted among 678 adults in October 1995. As one of the most comprehensive contributions on development indicators in the history of South Africa, it is the first large survey covering the usual “hard” indicators – such as service delivery levels – and peoples’ comments and perceptions of these services and of their governments’ development programmes and priorities. The study/project was motivated by the need to establish an information database for the preparation and monitoring of the province’s RDP business and development plans, to synthesise subjectively articulated (bottom-up) and objectively defined (top-down) approaches to the determination of needs, to modify and improve on  the usefulness of the Human Development Index (HDI), to provide an opportunity for research capacity building among civil servants and thereby providing a means to effect good governance practices and, to provide a basis for the development of objective matrices, objectives-by-time-scales and, a semi-rational budgeting and planning tool.  1 data file with 6,606 cases."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1998"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Economic Processes and Indicatorsational"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Africa - South Africa"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1) Kok, P; Ndlovu, B; O’Donovan, M.

Households were clustered at the Enumerator Area (EA) level, i.e. instead of each household being sampled separately, the group of households was sampled for each visited EA. Where two or more households were found at the same visiting point, the interviewer applied simple random selection procedures to select the household at which the interview would take place."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Face-to-face"},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured questionnaire "},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Three sets of weights were produced, namely a smoothing weight, a district weight and a combined weight of the previous two weights.
