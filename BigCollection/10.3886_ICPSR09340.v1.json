The Person File supplies data on each   sampled person who reported coverage by Medicare at any time in 1987   and who responded to all rounds of the Household Survey for which he or   she was eligible to respond. Data in this file include age, sex, race,   marital status, education, employment status, personal and family   income, coverage under private health insurance and public programs   such as Medicaid and CAMPUS/CAMPVA, and the total number and cost of   all prescriptions purchased in 1987 while under Medicare coverage. In   addition, there are indicators of general health and specific medical   conditions: stroke, cancer, heart disease, gallbladder disease, high   blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, rheumatism, emphysema,   arthritis and diabetes. The Prescribed Medicines Event File presents   data pertaining to every instance a prescribed medicine was purchased   or otherwise obtained by these Medicare beneficiaries during 1987. For   respondents who were covered by Medicare for part of the year, only   prescribed medicines acquired during the Medicare coverage period are   included. This file gives the trade and generic name of each prescribed   medication and reports the cost of the prescription and the medical  condition for which it was prescribed."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"illness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicaid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicare"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"payment methods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prescription drugs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.

(6) NMES consists   of several surveys including two household panel surveys: the Household   Survey and the Survey of American Indians and Alaska Natives (SAIAN).   The Household Survey, from which this data collection is derived,   surveyed the United States noninstitutionalized population and was   fielded over four rounds of personal and telephone interviews at   four-month intervals, with a short telephone interview constituting the   fifth final round. SAIAN, which was conducted over three rounds of   personal interviews, surveyed all persons who were eligible for care   through the Indian Health Service and were living on or near   reservations. These household surveys were supplemented by additional   surveys, most important of which are the Health Insurance Plans Survey   of employers and insurers of consenting household survey respondents,   and the Medical Provider Survey of physicians, osteopaths, and   inpatient and outpatient facilities, including home health care   agencies reported as providing services to any member of the   noninstitutionalized population sample. NMES also surveyed persons   resident in or admitted to long-term care facilities (nursing homes and   facilities for the mentally retarded) at any time in 1987. Information   on these individuals was obtained from the Survey of Institutions,   which collected data from facility administrators and designated staff,   and the Survey of Next-of-Kin, which collected data from the   respondent's next-of-kin or other knowledgeable persons. Together, the   major components of NMES provide measures of health status and   estimates of insurance coverage and the use of services, expenditures,   and sources of payment for the period from January 1 to December 31,   1987 for the civilian population of the United States. NMES continues a   series of national health care expenditure surveys carried out in the   past, particularly the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization and   Expenditures Survey (ICPSR 8239) and the 1977 National Medical Care  Expenditures Survey (ICPSR 8325, 8627, and 9076).; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1990-10-16"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1987"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"National Medical Expenditure Survey Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["personal interviews and telephone interviews"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United   States living in housing units, group quarters, and other  noninstitutional (nongroup) quarters."]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stratified multistage area probability sample of dwelling   units.
