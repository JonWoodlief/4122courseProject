The study has been updated with revised data supplied by the principal investigator to allow for comparable analyses with the Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study, 2001 (ICPSR 4291). This version of the data comprises the same 119 schools in the ICPSR 4291 data. Six schools in the previous version were dropped, six schools not in the previous version were added, and seven variables (MMDD, SERIAL, NEWC19_A, NEWC19_B, NEWC19_C, NEWC19_D, and WAVE) were added. In addition, ICPSR revised the documentation accordingly and added a SAS setup file to the collection. The SAS setup includes the PROC FORMAT statements from the previous version.;Version Date: 2003-12-02Version Text: 2003-12-02 Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: The principal investigator supplied a revised data file in which the number of colleges was reduced from 140 to 119 (2,189 cases were dropped). Some variables were removed, others were renamed, and new variables, including a weight variable, were added. In addition, ICPSR has identified 11 variables with one or more revised values (variables DRIVE, NUMPROB, PROBGULP, PROB5, PERSIST, NOBINGE, UPTAKE, GIVEUP, CONTBING, ANYDRUG1, and ANYDRUG2). The documentation and other supporting files were revised accordingly.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: LRECL with SAS setup file, SAS transport (CPORT) file, and SPSS export file;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: (1) This study was previously distributed under the  title ALCOHOL USE AND ABUSE AMONG AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS, 1993.
