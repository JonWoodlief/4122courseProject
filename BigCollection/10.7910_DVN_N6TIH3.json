Nontraditional jobs included occupations such as plumbers, electricians, cable splicers, and forklift operators. Participants were selected from a cross-section of training and employment settings from the three metropolitan areas of California: San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. They all were in a training or on-the-job program in a skilled or semiskilled occupation in the fall of 1975. A control group of women in more traditional service occupations such as cosmetology was interviewed during the first year.\r\n<br /><br />  In the winter and spring of 1975 and 1976, 117 women participated in a two to three hour interview (86 involved in nontraditional blue collar work, and 31 involved in traditional, female-dominated, skilled and semi-skilled jobs). The interview focused on the following areas: childhood experiences and family background; general work history and how respondent became involved in blue collar work; work roles and family roles; current work and training experiences; and relationships with people on the job.<br /><br />  In the spring of 1977, 61 of the original respondents were reinterviewed (51 nontraditional, and 10 traditional). This interview focused on the following areas: satisfactions and dissatisfactions with current employment; skills and training necessary for the job; support networks; and work and family roles.<br /><br />  In the spring of 1978, telephone interviews were conducted with 54 of the original 86 women involved in nontraditional blue collar employment.\r\nThis interview focused on the following areas: current employment; changes in job type, classification or salary, and/or employer; respondent's reasons for staying with/changing jobs; and future employment prospects.\r\n<br /><br /> The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (interview transcripts from the three waves of data ).
