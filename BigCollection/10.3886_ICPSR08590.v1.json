Other questions probed   for respondents' opinions on locating AIDS treatment and housing   centers, allowing students with AIDS to attend public schools, removing   public school employees with AIDS from their jobs, putting people with   AIDS into quarantine, and paying extra taxes to fund research to cure   the disease.
