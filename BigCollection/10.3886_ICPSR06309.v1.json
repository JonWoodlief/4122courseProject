Its purpose was to study the   political attitudes and behavior of the Canadian electorate. The 1990   survey represented one of a series of interlocking panels, the others   being 1988 pre- and post-election surveys (see POLITICAL SUPPORT IN   CANADA, 1983-1988 [ICPSR 9874]) and the 1993 post-election survey. The   1990 survey's 161 var\niables are derived from an extensive battery of   questions on respondents' evaluations of national and personal   economies and their support for national political authorities and for   regional and community politics. Respondents were asked to indicate how   closely they followed politics, how much they discussed and   participated in politics, and how warm or cool (on a 100-degree scale)   they felt toward the country, their community, and government at   several levels, including political parties and party leaders. They   were asked to state their agreement or disagreement with a number of   attitudinal statements regarding taxes, equal treatment of citizens by   the federal government, equal representation and opportunities for   participation in government, and economic opportunity. Specific   opinions were obtained on the Meech Lake Accord, the North American   Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the separation of Quebec. A number of   questions asked respondents to assess their own economic welfare as   well as its relation to the federal government's management of the   national economy. Membership in national and regional parties was   identified. Also included are demographic characteristics of   respondents, such as occupation, education, language, age, life  satisfaction, and income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NAFTA"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.2.
