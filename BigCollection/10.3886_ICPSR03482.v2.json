The researchers combined the strengths of law  enforcement reporting and medical reporting in one dataset. The  homicide data contain information on victims and circumstances of the  34,542 homicides investigated by law enforcement agencies in  California for the period 1990 to 1999. The data are Supplementary  Homicide Reports (SHR), which are received monthly by the Department  of Justice from all local California law enforcement agencies as part  of the national Uniform Crime Reporting program (UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS  [UNITED STATES]: SUPPLEMENTARY HOMICIDE REPORTS, 1976-1999 [ICPSR  3180]). The researchers linked the SHRs to the CDHS vital statistics  mortality data, which contain the death records provided by the  medical examiner or coroner of each county after investigation of the  death. Variables include total number of offenders involved, weapon  used in the homicide, county of the victim's residence, location and  date of the incident, date of death, cause of death, date of arrest  for the suspect, and whether supplemental homicide report matched the  death record. Demographic data include age, sex, and race of the victim  and the suspect, relationships between the suspect and the victim, and the victim's marital status."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"causes of death"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"homicide"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victims"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vital statistics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
