Using firearms confiscated by the Dallas,  Texas, police department from 1980 to 1992 as indicators of the types  of guns circulating among criminal/high-risk groups, the project  examined changes over time in Dallas' street gun arsenal and assessed  the impact these changes had upon gun violence mortality in  Dallas. The focus of the project was on the characteristics of the  guns rather than their numbers. All confiscated firearms were analyzed  and characterized according to basic weapon type and caliber  groupings. Dates of confiscation were missing from the majority of the  pre-1988 records, but by aggregating the gun data into bimonthly (Part  1) and quarterly (Part 2) time series databases, it was possible to  estimate the bimonthly and quarterly periods of confiscation for most  of the 1980-1992 records. Records that could not be assigned to  bimonthly or quarterly periods were dropped. Confiscated firearms were  grouped into basic categories based on stopping power (i.e., wounding  potential), rate of fire, and ammunition capacity. The following  measures were created for each bimonthly and quarterly period: (1)  weapons with high stopping power (large guns), (2) semiautomatic  weaponry (semis), (3) weapons combining high stopping power and a  semiautomatic firing mechanism (large semis), (4) handguns with high  stopping power (large handguns), (5) semiautomatic handguns (semi  handguns), and (6) handguns combining high stopping power and  semiautomatic firing (large semi handguns). Several violence measures  were obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform  Crime Reports Supplemental Homicide Reports and Return A (or Offenses  Known and Clearances by Arrest) data files (see UNIFORM CRIME  REPORTING PROGRAM DATA [UNITED STATES]: 1975-1997 [ICPSR 9028]). These  measures were also aggregated at bimonthly and quarterly levels. Data  from the Dallas Police Department master gun property file include  total handguns, total semiautomatic handguns, total large-caliber  handguns, total large-caliber semiautomatic handguns, total shotguns,  total semiautomatic shotguns, total rifles, total semiautomatic  rifles, and total counts and total semiautomatic counts for various  calibers of handguns, shotguns, and rifles.

However, a number of  recent studies have linked increases in homicides to the growing use  of semiautomatic and/or high-powered firearms by criminals. These  studies imply that gun violence is becoming more deadly due to the  substitution of more lethal firearms for\nless lethal firearms. Using  data from Dallas, Texas, for the period 1980-1992, this study examined  the relationships among trends in deadly gun violence, overall gun  availability, and the availability of more lethal types of guns. Using  firearms confiscated by police as indicators of the types of guns  circulating among criminal/high-risk groups, the project examined  changes over time in Dallas's street gun arsenal and assessed the  impact these changes had upon gun violence mortality in Dallas. The  project also examined whether trends in the use of different types of  guns predicted gun homicides better than a more traditional measure of overall gun density."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was based on information regarding  approximately 58,000 guns confiscated by Dallas police from 1980  through 1992. The data include guns seized in association with arrests  or other incidents as well as guns that were found or voluntarily  turned in by citizens. The focus of the project was on the  characteristics of the guns rather than their numbers.

These measures were also aggregated at  bimonthly and quarterly levels. An added advantage to using the  bimonthly and quarterly time points was that they provide robust gun  measures that are less sensitive to random events that could  conceivably distort the gun measures (such as drug busts, which might produce large caches of weapons)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data from the Dallas, Texas, police department  master gun property file include total handguns, total semiautomatic  handguns, total large-caliber handguns, total large-caliber  semiautomatic handguns, total shotguns, total semiautomatic shotguns,  total rifles, total semiautomatic rifles, and total counts and total  semiautomatic counts for various calibers of handguns, shotguns, and  rifles.
