The factors considered in  conducting the study were Houston's economic downturn in the late 1970s  and much of the 1980s, the ethnic mix of the city's population, the  diverse demographic makeup of the city's police force, and the use of illegal drugs."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were collected from all Houston homicide  cases recorded in the police murder logs for 1985-1994.
