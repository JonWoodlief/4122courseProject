In this study, we evaluated whether measuring D-dimer levels can help to diagnose cerebral infarction (CI) in critically ill cancer patients. \r\nMethods: We retrospectively evaluated all patients with malignancies who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between March 2010 and February 2014 at the medical oncology intensive care unit (ICU) of Samsung Medical Center. Brain MRI scanning was performed when CI was suspected due to acute neurological deficits. We compared D-dimer levels between patients ultimately diagnosed as having or not having CI and analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion patterns. \r\nResults: A total of 88 patients underwent brain MRI scanning due to clinical suspicion of CI; altered mental status and unilateral hemiparesis were the most common neurological deficits. CI was ultimately diagnosed in 43 (49%) patients. According to the DWI patterns, multiple arterial infarctions (40%) were more common than single arterial infarctions (9%). Cryptogenic stroke etiologies were more common (63%) than determined etiologies. There was no significant difference in D-dimer levels between patients with and without CI (P = 0.319). Although D-dimer levels were not helpful in diagnosing CI, D-dimer levels were associated with cryptogenic etiologies in critically ill cancer patients; D-dimer levels were higher in the cryptogenic etiology group than in the determined etiology group or the non-infarction group (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, elevated D-dimer levels (> 8.89 μg/mL) were only associated with cryptogenic stroke (adjusted OR 5.455; 95% confidence interval, 1.876 – 15.857). \r\nConclusions: Abnormal D-dimer levels may support the diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke in critically ill cancer patients."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-07-15"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Geun-Ho Lee"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-07-14"}]}},"files":[{"label":"D-dimer levels and ischemic stroke HDN.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":127508,"dataFile":{"id":3036282,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/SSIGRV/KOI07O","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SSIGRV/KOI07O","filename":"D-dimer levels and ischemic stroke HDN.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":104871,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15d419e8822-72c9dab42fcd","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fd22c7a2b944d3f32b1fb1fb713f44ea","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fd22c7a2b944d3f32b1fb1fb713f44ea"}}}]}}}
