High costs may help savers protect resources from the demands of others. I investigate this hypothesis by randomly assigning ATM cards to 1,100 newly-opened bank accounts in rural Kenya. These cards reduced withdrawal fees by 50 percent. While the cards increased overall account use, the positive treatment effect is entirely driven by joint and male-owned accounts. I also find that individuals with low levels of household bargaining power save less when accounts have ATM cards, while individuals with high levels of household bargaining power save more."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Intra-household bargaining"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Transaction costs"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Economic development"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Saving"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Russell Sage Foundation"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"George and Obie Shultz Fund"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MIT's Jameel Poverty Action Lab"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Yale Savings and Payments Research Fund at Innovations for Poverty Action"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Research Support, Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-08-28"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey data","Administrative data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stata"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"13"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Kenya"},"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Busia and Teso South districts"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individuals and Couples"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Married couples"]},{"typeName":"dataCollector","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The author identified communities surrounding 19 primary schools, which were located within 8 miles of Family Bankâ€™s Busia branch.

These couples were asked if they currently had any accounts with Family Bank, and if not, whether they would be interested in opening a new Mwananchi Account. All co-resident couples who (a) had no pre-existing Family Bank accounts, (b) expressed interest in opening at least one account, and (c) were in possession of their national ID cards were issued an invitation to an account opening camp the following day. In all, a subset of 1,114 newly-opened bank accounts owned by 749 married couples were randomly selected to receive ATM cards free of
