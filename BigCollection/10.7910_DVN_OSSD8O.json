This study assesses the association between Anglos’ aversion to Latinos, physical proximity to Latinos, and contact with ethnic minorities; with expressed preferences for immigration policies.  Methods. Data were drawn from a telephone survey of San Diego County, California, residents (N=549 Anglos) using random digit dial procedures during 2006 that was conducted by closely supervised professional interviewers. Descriptive reports, tau-b correlations, and multivariate logistic regressions were used for analysis.  Results. Aversion to Latinos, as indicated by an adaptation of the Bogardus social distance scale, was related to more restrictionist attitudes about legal and Mexican immigration. Associations increased when respondents were primed to consider Mexican immigration, although aversion to Latinos was not related to attitudes about amnesty for undocumented persons. Contrary to some previous findings proximity to Latino populations increased opposition to legal immigration, Mexican immigration, and amnesty. Reported minority contact had minimal impact that failed to meet traditional levels of significance. Conclusions. Attitudes about immigration may be partially motivated by racial resentments, more so than other considerations. Further research should identify racial factors that influence Anglos’ attitudes on policy positions that extend beyond the Anglo/African division."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-04-25"}]}},"files":[{"description":"R code to replicate tables and figures","label":"SSQ_Immigration_2009.R","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":66678,"dataFile":{"id":1480520,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"SSQ_Immigration_2009.R","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":22909,"description":"R code to replicate tables and figures","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:39682","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ca994146536fbd1ba00deb09fef3a045","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ca994146536fbd1ba00deb09fef3a045"}}},{"description":"Data","label":"ssq.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":66678,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":1480522,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"ssq.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":1991081,"description":"Data","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:39683","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:3:ODPRSFGhMftgs8fWOaU4jA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"46b7e96c7827bd4b1b3206923e3975af","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"46b7e96c7827bd4b1b3206923e3975af"}}}]}}}
