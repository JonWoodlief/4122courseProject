However, modern amplicon-based sequencing techniques by themselves typically provide no information about the absolute abundance of microbes. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR as independent estimates of microbial abundance to test the hypothesis that microbial symbionts have enabled ants to dominate tropical rainforest canopies by facilitating herbivorous diets, and compare these methods to microbial diversity profiles from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Through a systematic survey of ants from a lowland tropical forest, we show that the density of gut microbiota varies across several orders of magnitude among ant lineages, with median individuals from many genera only marginally above detection limits. Supporting the hypothesis that microbial symbiosis is important to dominance in the canopy, we find that the abundance of gut bacteria is positively correlated with stable isotope proxies of herbivory among canopy-dwelling ants, but not among ground-dwelling ants. Notably, these broad findings are much more evident in the quantitative data than in the 16S rRNA sequencing data. Our results provide quantitative context to the potential role of bacteria in facilitating the antsâ€™ dominance of the tropical rainforest canopy, and have broad implications for the interpretation of sequence-based surveys of microbial diversity."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-06-14"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"arXiv"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/07/114512"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sanders, Jon"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-06-14"}]}},"files":[{"description":"All fluorescence micrographs collected in the field for this manuscript, along with a spreadsheet containing information about the images.
