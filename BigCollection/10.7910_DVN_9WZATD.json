The puzzle addressed is the large degree of variation in policy output across states that are similar in terms of political or economic structure. Although one can tell individual stories about each country, the overall variation deﬁes the cross-applicability of typical explanations. Where states better draw lessons from experience we s\nhould expect two re- sults. First, structural characteristics of the state or of the set of HIV policy responders affects the character and degree of learning: the conﬁguration of decision-making authority and information analytics interact with the learning process, affecting the lessons drawn and policies pursued. Second, over time we observe some degree of policy convergence among states due to comparison and adaptation from others. The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach. As a plausibility probe, I employ econometric analysis to test for such patterns. I constructed an original dataset of 72 countries over 6 years and approximately 25 variables. To address data missingness, I employed multiple imputation techniques. I ﬁnd statistically and substantively signiﬁcant relationships and patterns, as above, indicating fur- ther exploration of the underlying processes. I then test the theory via process-tracing case study comparisons of Mexi- can and Botswanan HIV/AIDS policy development over the last two decades. Drawing on written accounts, periodical articles, government documents, and oral interviews, I examine how the availability, management, and application of information\naffected the policies pursued. In Mexico, two factors have helped to drive success: ﬁrst, the set of organizations working on HIV/AIDS policy are or- ganized as a loose network with the specialized government HIV agency serving as the hub of decisions and information exchange; second, a stable (but open) set of people have participated over the whole period. Botswana’s success has been more mixed; although its very high adult prevalence levels contribute, organiza- tional learning factors also play a role. HIV policy response actors are arranged anarchically and there have been multiple centers of authority. This has detracted from the ability to prospect and identify relevant information and then draw ac- tionable conclusions.
