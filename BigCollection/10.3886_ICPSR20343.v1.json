Approximately  91 percent of the suspects in the Milwaukee Domestic Violence  Experiment were male. Since females composed such a small proportion  of the total suspect sample, and because of the possibility that  spouse assault involving a female perpetrator is a fundamentally  different event from that involving a male, the researchers decided to  eliminate the cases for 110 female suspects from their analysis. An  additional 23 cases were deleted because of missing demographic or  employment information, thus leaving 1,067 cases in the data in this  collection.</p>\n\n<p>For their published analyses, the researchers created the first  subset of 825 suspects by selecting the 479 arrested suspects that  answered 4 or more of the questions of interest on the suspect survey  and the 346 suspects who were warned but not arrested. While the  dependent variable was observed for the entire sample, only those  suspects who were arrested and agreed to be interviewed provided data  on whether they believed they had been treated in a procedurally fair  manner. Thus, the sample of 825 suspects was only used for some of the  analyses reported by the researchers because only suspects who were  arrested were interviewed and had an opportunity to provide this  information.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, to create the second subset for analyses, the  researchers first selected, from the original full file, the 721 cases  that were male arrestees. From these 721 cases, the researchers  selected only male arrestees that answered 4 or more of the questions  of interest on the suspect survey, thus creating a subsample of 479  male arrestees\n. The researchers restricted their analysis of the  arrested suspects to these individuals because they did not wish to  generalize the results to individuals who did not complete the vast  majority of items on the survey. Accordingly, in the remaining  analyses, the subsample of 479 arrestees were the principal focus.</p>"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"none"},{"typeName":"otherDataAppraisal","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"none"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Effect of Procedural Justice in Spouse Assault in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1987-1989","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":40581,"dataFile":{"id":2654793,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Effect of Procedural Justice in Spouse Assault in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1987-1989","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
