The data were taken from a mailback survey of 20,211 individuals in each of the United States. Survey recipients were 9 years of age and older and identified as hunters and/or fishermen. Approximately 450 variables measure the respondents' activities and expenditures in the areas of hunting and fishing, e.g., amount of time spent hunting and fishing, type of game and fish sought, problems associated with the activities, and money spent on various aspects of the activities. There are also several demographic variables, e.g., age, gender, income, and state of residence. The first phase of this study, which is captured in the dataset WILDLIFE RECREATION SURVEY, 1975 (ICPSR 7787), contains data from a telephone survey of United States residents which asked more general questions about wildlife recreation resource usage. From that survey, the sample of hunters and fishermen was identified for use in this study."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fishing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"human behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hunting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"outdoor recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation expenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"states (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"target shooting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"time utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.F.

(1) A probability sample of telephone exchanges  in each of the 50 United States was drawn and then distributed  throughout each state. Depending on the proportion of the  metro/non-metro residents, the number of metro to non-metro telephone  exchanges was selected on a 1:1 (nine states), 1:3 (seven states), or  1:2 (all other states) ratio, in order to enhance the possibility of  identifying more hunters and fishermen for the follow-up mail survey  phase. Then a systematic random sample was drawn from all the  four-digit numbers within the random banks of all sample  exchanges. The subsequent seven-digit telephone numbers were then  randomized within each state. A sufficient number of private-household  telephone numbers was generated to allow the completion of  approximately 2,000 household telephone interviews per state (with  some exceptions), for a total of 106,294 households. (2) Hunters and  fishermen identified in the telephone sample were subsampled (in ways  intended to maximize the amount of information obtained from each  questionnaire mailed out) to select individuals 9 years of age and  older who hunted and/or fished in 1975. In each state (with some exceptions) 1,000 such individuals were mailed questionnaires."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"National Hunting and Fishing Survey, 1975","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35764,"dataFile":{"id":2614470,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"National Hunting and Fishing Survey, 1975","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
