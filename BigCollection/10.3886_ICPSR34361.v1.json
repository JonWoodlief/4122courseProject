Specifically, the research team proposed to supplement and build the necessary administ\nrative data infrastructure to enable Washington University and collaborating partners to use state and national healthcare datasets for observational CER by:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Purchasing, storing, and maintaining multiple large administrative databases that can be used for comparative effectiveness health services research.</li>\n<li>Providing training and support on the ethical and secure use of administrative data for CER.</li>\n<li>Providing a library of standard programming code for use with large administrative databases to create an economy of scale for efficient CER.</li>\n<li>Facilitating the collaboration among interdisciplinary investigators using administrative databases for CER.</li>\n<li>Utilizing the infrastructure to support initiation of new comparative effectiveness studies.</li>\n<li>Educating physicians, junior investigators, and public health trainees in the use of administrative data for CER.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>No data was collected for this infrastructure project. Administrative data were purchased from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Chronic Condition Warehouse 5 percent random sample, all files except Part D, 2007), AHRQ (nationwide from 1998-2010 and multiple states from 2000-2010), Claritas (2005-2008), and the American Hospital Association Annual Survey (2000-2008).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Access.</strong>\nThese data are not available from ICPSR.
