Implementation of a  redesigned NHIS, consisting of a basic module, a periodic module, and  a topical module, began in 1997 (see NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY,  1997 [ICPSR 2954]). The 2004 NHIS contains the Household, Family,  Person, Sample Adult and Sample Child files from the basic  module. Each record in the Household-level File (Part 1) contains data  on type of living quarters, number of families in the household  responding and not responding, and the month and year of the interview  for each sampling unit. The Family-level File (Part 2) is made up of  reconstructed variables from the person-level data of the basic module  and includes information on sex, age, race, marital status, Hispanic  origin, education, veteran status, family income, family size, major  activities, health status, activity limits, and employment status,  along with industry and occupation. As part of the basic module, the  Person-level File (Part 3)\nprovides information on all family members  with respect to health status, limitation of daily activities,  cognitive impairment, and health conditions. Also included are data on  years at current residence, region variables, height, weight, bed  days, doctor visits, hospital stays, and health care access and  utilization. A randomly-selected adult in each family was interviewed  for the Sample Adult File (Part 4) regarding respiratory conditions,  use of nasal spray, renal conditions, AIDS, joint symptoms, health  status, limitation of daily activities, and behaviors such as smoking,  alcohol consumption, and physical activity. The Sample Child File  (Part 5) provides information from an adult in the household on  medical conditions of one child in the household, such as respiratory  problems, seizures, allergies, and use of special equipment like  hearing aids, braces, or wheelchairs. Also included are variables  regarding child behavior, the use of mental health services, and  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as well as responses  to the SDQ-EX, which is the extended version of Strengths and  Difficulties questionnaire on child mental health. Several changes  have occurred in the 2004 NHIS. The Child Immunization Section (CIM)  has been dropped. Also new in 2004, questionnaires have been provided  in both English and Spanish. The Injury/Poison Episode File (Part 6)  is an episode-based file that contains information about the external  cause and nature of the injury or poisoning episode and what the  person was doing at the time of the injury or poisoning episode, in  addition to the date and place of occurrence. The Injury/Poison  Episode Verbatim File (Part 7) contains edited narrative text  descriptions of the injury or poisoning provided by the  respondent. Imputed income files for 2004 are now available through the NCHS Web site at www.cdc.gov/nhis."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"assistive devices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disabilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"doctor visits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hospitalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"illness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"immunization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"injuries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physical disabilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"poisoning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.

In previous years,  one household equaled one \"case.\" In 2004, each family is considered a  separate case. For multiple-family households, there is a \"parent\"  case designated for the first family identified, and each subsequent  family becomes a \"spawned\" case from the parent, with its own unique  ID number. (2) Because variables are not repeated on data files in the  2004 NHIS, users will need to me\nrge files in order to analyze the  data. Instructions on merging files are found in the Survey  Description. Also included in 2004 are Variable Summary Reports that  describe the variable and the question number on which it was based,  and Variable Layout Reports that provide the actual question that  generated the variable along with the universe and response  values. (3) The data from the Household-level File can be merged with  any of the other files, and other files can be merged as well. For  further information on merging data, consult the Survey Description.  (4) The Injury/Poison Episode Verbatim File (Part 7) is available only  with SAS setup files.
