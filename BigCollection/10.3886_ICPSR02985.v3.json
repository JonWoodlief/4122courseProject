Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bi\nll Clinton, the United States Congress, Vice President Al Gore, Texas Governor George W. Bush, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, Arizona Senator John McCain, and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan. Respondents were also asked for their opinions on the effectiveness of the Clinton Administration and the United States Congress, as well as the effectiveness of government in general and the election process in particular. Those queried were asked whether there were any differences between the two major candidates for president, if the candidates were typical representatives of their respective parties, and how relevant character issues were in the campaign. Views were also sought about the role of the Religious Right, the best way to manage Social Security/Medicare, defense spending, and the status of the public school system.
