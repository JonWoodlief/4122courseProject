They are produced,  distributed, and retailed in markets that are not entirely unlike the  markets for licit goods. This research sought to answer questions such  as: (1) By how much will consumption change if prices increase? and  (2) If the price of one drug goes up, will users switch to another  drug? The answers to these questions have significant policy  implications. The primary objective of drug enforcement is to reduce  consumption and increase price, using interdiction and source country  control. However, the final step of translating the projected increase  in price into a reduction in consumption is never satisfactory,  because the elasticity of demand is not known. Better knowledge of the  extent of substitution would also aid policy planning, analysis, and  evaluation. Furthermore, interventions designed to affect price could  consider how the difference in the higher fraction of disposable  income absorbed by drug purchases for women and youth affect  demand. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate the  elasticity of the quantity of cocaine and heroin consumed with respect to the price."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In general, price elasticity is the percentage of  change in the dependent quantity corresponding to a one-percent change  in price. The focus of this research was the development of an  econometric model to determine price elasticity corresponding to the  percentage of change in the quantity of cocaine and heroin consumed to  the change in the price of cocaine and heroin. The use of the standard  econometric model was not feasible, given that national- and  city-level data on consumption of cocaine and heroin are insufficient  or nonexistent. The researchers adapted the model by partitioning the  desired elasticity into the product of two elasticities, involving a  measurable intermediate quantity whose relationship to the quantity of  consumption could be modeled and estimated by measurable  techniques. The intermediate quantity used for this project was the  fraction of arrestees testing positive for cocaine or heroin as  measured by the Drug Use Forecasting System. From the STRIDE data,  cocaine and heroin purchase records were used if (1) they had a  positive purity, (2) the amount paid was greater than one dollar, and  (3) the total weight was between 0.05 and 40 grams. To partially  offset the situations in which cities' records were inadequate to  produce reliable quarterly price estimates, data were augmented with  records from adjoining cities. Gross outliers were eliminated with a  coarse filter based on price per gram, ignoring purity. A second step  eliminated observations whose standard price was more than five times  farther from the median standardized price for its location and  quarter than the median distance. Expected purity was then computed by  regressing on log quantity and dummy variables for location and  quarter. Price series were produced by finding the median standardized  price per expected pure gram of the remaining records for each  location and quarter, provided at least five such records existed. If fewer than five records existed, the price was recorded as missing."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables for Part 1, National Data, include year,  quarter, standardized prices for a gram of cocaine and a gram of  heroin, and expected purity of cocaine and heroin.
