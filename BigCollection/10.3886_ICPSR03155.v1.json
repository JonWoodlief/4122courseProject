To that end, the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances was designed to gather household-level information closely comparable to that obtained in the SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES, 1995 (ICPSR 2193). Detailed data were collected on the composition of household budgets, the terms of loans, and relationships with financial institutions.  Information was also obtained on the employment history and pension rights of the survey respondent and the spouse or partner of the respondent. Detailed data were also gathered on characteristics of the survey respondent's housing and vehicle(s). In addition to recording data on the economic assets and liabilities of families, the survey examined the attitudes of consumers toward credit use and their reactions to consumer credit regulations, and lines of credit. Demographic variables include age, sex, marital status, housing, and financial independence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer protection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"credit"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"debt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"durable goods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial assets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial institutions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household budgets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"loans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vehicles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR IX.

Kennickell and R. Louise  Woodburn, \"Consistent Weight Design for the 1989, 1992, and 1995 SCFs,  and the Distribution of Wealth,\" August 1997,   http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html\n<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html\">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html</a>\nfor more  details). One set of the survey cases was selected from a standard  multistage area probability design. This part of the sample, which  contributed 2,813 cases to the final set of interviews, is intended to  provide good coverage of characteristics, such as home ownership, that  are broadly distributed in the population. The other set of the survey  cases was selected as a list sample from statistical records (the  Individual Tax File) derived from tax data by the Statistics of Income  Division of the Internal Revenue Service. These records were made  available under strict rules governing confidentiality, the rights of  potential respondents to refuse participation in the survey, and the  types of information that can be made available. This second sample  was designed to disproportionately select families that were likely to  be relatively wealthy (see Arthur B. Kennickell, \"List Sample Design  for the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances,\" April 1998,   http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html\n<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html\">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html</a>\n, for a  more extended discussion of the design of the list sample). The list  sample contributed 1,496 cases to the final set of interviews. Because  of the complexity of the SCF design, users cannot apply some of the  standard procedures for variance estimation. A set of sample  replicates has been created with bootstrap techniques and analysis  weights have been computed independently for each replicate. Analysts  may use these weights to make approximate estimates of sampling  variance. Replicate weights corresponding to both X42000 and X42001 are available. See the codebook for more details."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Main Data Set","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42178,"dataFile":{"id":2665201,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Main Data Set","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Replicate Weight File -- X42000","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42178,"dataFile":{"id":2665202,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Replicate Weight File -- X42000","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Replicate Weight File -- X42001","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42178,"dataFile":{"id":2665203,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Replicate Weight File -- X42001","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
