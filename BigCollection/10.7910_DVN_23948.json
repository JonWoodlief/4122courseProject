Information was collected from varied sets of key respondents using participatory techniques through a group interview schedule. This version presents information collected on an annual basis across four years 2008-2009, 2009-2010, 2010-2011 and 2011-12.   The five different categories of key respondent interviewed include -   The CBO Leadership Team (LT) - the group of people - elected or nominated who are in charge of the strategic operations of the CBO.   The Office Bearers (OB) - including the President, the Vice-President, the Treasurer, the Secretary who are responsible for day to day operations of the CBOs.   The Implementing Partner (IP) - The NGO which is responsible for establishing and supporting the CBO through its early days.   The Committees - thematic sub-groups of the CBO comprising of the members and LT people which handle thematic areas such as crisis response, advocacy etc.   Community sub-group - community members of the CBOS who participate in CBO activities who the intended recipient of all the activities of the CBOs.  Data is organised by these five respondent categories - Leadership Team (LT), Office Bearers (OB), Implementing Partner (IP), Committee and Community sub-group - two groups.    For each of these five respondent categories, there are three types of files. Quantitative data is presented in Stata file (by respondent category name - 6 files), Qualitative data in excel wherever available by the respondent category name - 6 files, and a codebook in excel which details the variables, questions asked, response codes etc - 5 files.   Additionally, within community sub-groups, their constituent committees were also interviewed. This information is presented in excel and is called Sub-group committee 1 and 2.   Further, alongside respondent interviews, CBO level information was collected from IP and CBO themselves. The two block of information are presented as factsheet information - quantitative (2 files), qualitative (1 file) and codebook (2 files).

This yielded a total of 35 community-based groups from 32 AVAHAN districts in the first round in 2008-2009, although many groups had not taken the form of organisations. For the second round of the study in 2009-2010, the sample size was increased from 35 CBGs to 40 CBGs. In the interest of continuity and comparability, 80 per cent of the CBOs sampled in 2009 were retained, with the additional CBOs selected using the same criteria. The same method was followed in 2011 and 2012, where 42 and 37 CBOs were sampled respectively.

Responses from the interviews were checked against documentary evidence (e.g., meeting minutes) and triangulated across different respondent groups.
