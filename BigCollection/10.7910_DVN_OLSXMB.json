Embora seja uma revista voltada para o intercâmbio entre comunicação, jornalismo e educação, houve espaço e demanda para o mapeamento da produção midiática na longa região pensada como Amazônia. A edição se escora na questão definidora de como os homens amazônicos utilizaram a mídia para dar um sentido para a Amazônia. Ou, ainda, como pensaram a si mesmos e como buscaram cristalizar essa identidade através do uso das crescentes tecnologias de mídia disponíveis?\r\nOs estudos sobre a Amazônia e a Mídia ainda estão encapsulados em estados e cidades específicas ou em mídias ou formatos discursivos recortados. Salvo trabalhos que constituem vastas compilações sobre discursos de viajantes ou sínteses apressadas de brasilianistas, não resultam do diálogo de pesquisadores no Norte do país, muito menos encaram a presença de amazônias esquecidas, igualmente importantes para a constituição de uma identidade cultural amazônica. Nesse contexto, torna-se necessário promover diálogos mais extensos envolvendo centro, periferias e outros lugares da bacia hidrográfica igualmente importantes para a composição de uma identidade amazônica. A cultura impressa estabelecida entre os séculos XIX e XX reflete o desejo do homem amazônico de figurar no panorama político brasileiro, garantir uma identidade própria, fixar uma memória relativa à importância da sua terra e gente, da mesma forma como acontecerá com a inclusão de uma produção radiofônica e cinematográfica local. \r\n","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a8cc7d4a0-64ec0f9acf29","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3dbf534a5edd583d3b6ea1202b29589f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3dbf534a5edd583d3b6ea1202b29589f"}}},{"description":"This study seeks to contribute to the understanding of the trajectory of photography in the newspapers of Pará, from one of the main printed forms of the country, the State of Pará (1911-1980).
