Questions specific   to the campaign assessed respondents' opinions of the two candidates,   the voting intentions of respondents, Jim Florio's performance as   governor with regard to his handling of taxes and automobile insurance,   Whitman's relationship to the National Rifle Association, Florio's   closeness to Clinton, the effect that each candidate would have on   taxes if elected, and the honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, ability,   and experience of Florio and Whitman. General questions concerned the   future of New Jersey, the New Jersey state legislature, the New Jersey   economy, assault weapons, the National Rifle Association, welfare   benefits for children born to welfare mothers, the New Jersey public   schools, Ross Perot, moving the New York Yankees to New\nJersey, and the   Clinton presidency. Background information on respondents includes   voter registration status, financial situation, employment situation,   crime victimization, vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, in   the 1990 New Jersey election for the United States Senate, and in the   1989 New Jersey gubernatorial election, gun ownership, political party,   political orientation, religion, education, household income, age, sex,  race, and Hispanic origin."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
