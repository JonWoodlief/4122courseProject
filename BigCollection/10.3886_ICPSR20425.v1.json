In Part 1 (Older Adolescent Data), participants were 125 male and female undergraduate students ranging in age from 18 to 27 years, who were recruited from psychology and human development classes in upstate New York between 2002 and 2003 and received course credit for participating in a study of relationships and problem solving. In small group testing sessions, participants completed assessments of several personality factors, justification of aggression, self-esteem, other-esteem, and aggression. Participants also completed the hypothetical situations task in which they assessed the provocateur's intent and their own likely response in each. For Part 2 (Adolescent Data), participants included 184 adolescents who were between the ages of 14 and 17 and enrolled at a suburban high school in upstate New York in 2003 and 2004. Adolescents were recruited to participate in a study of relationships and problem solving through announcements made by the researcher in the students' homeroom. A total of nine homerooms participated across two academic years. Each participating student's homeroom teacher completed an assessment regarding the student's behavior. As in Part 1, the students completed several self-assessments and a hypothetical situations tasks. Both Parts 1 and 2 include the demographic variables age, race, and gender and scores from the personality factors, justification of aggression, self-esteem, other-esteem, and aggression assessments and the hypothetical situations task.

Participants also completed the hypothetical situations task in which they assessed the provocateur's intent and their own likely response in each. Intent and response statements were entered verbatim into separate electronic databases. Unaware of the study hypotheses, 3 male and 6 female undergraduates  were trained to independently code the exhaustive lists of 170 different intents and 339 different responses. The coders were instructed to assign low scores to positive intents, moderate scores to ambiguous intents, and high scores to aggressive intents. Similarly, coders assigned low scores to positive responses, moderate scores to ambiguous responses, and high scores to aggressive responses. Intent and response scores across all four vignettes were averaged, yielding one score for hostile attribution bias and one for response generation.

Adolescents were recruited to participate in a study of relationships and problem solving through announcements made by the researcher in the students' homeroom. A total of nine homerooms participated across two academic years. All participation was voluntary with the adolescents and a parent or legal guardian providing written consent. Adolescent participants completed all of the study materials in group testing sessions during their homeroom period. Participants were compensated with ten dollars cash for participating in the study. Each participating student's homeroom teacher complete\nd an assessment regarding the student's behavior. The eight participating teachers were each provided a twenty dollar gift card to a bookstore and a book on child development.
