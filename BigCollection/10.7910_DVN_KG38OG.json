Past research has linked this fact to an unusual coalition of Christian and New Left groups, which both draw a connection from modern embryology to eugenics under the Nazis.\r\n\r\nIn this article, the workings of this alleged alliance are demonstrated at the micro-level for the first time.  The behaviour of individual MPs in a crucial free vote on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is modelled using data on their political, sectoral, and religious affiliations. Identifying as a Catholic and membership in Christian organisations are strong predictors of resistance to PGD. Even more importantly, net of religious and professional ties, affiliation with \\emph{either the Christian Democrats or the left-libertarian Green party} is closely linked to restrictive bioethical preferences.\r\n\r\nThe modest liberalisation in 2011 was contingent on external factors and the overwhelming support of the historically unusually large FDP delegation. With the FDP no longer represented in parliament and the Christian Democratic/New Left issue coalition even stronger than before, further liberalisation is unlikely.\r\n\r\nThis archive contains all the data and scripts for Stata to reproduce the tables and graphs in the Research & Politics article"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Arzheimer, Kai"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-07-20"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Recorded votes and (official) biographical data for German MPs involved in the 2011 PGD decision"]}]}},"files":[{"label":"pgd-vote-replication.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":75846,"dataFile":{"id":2694884,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KG38OG/AA1BUW","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KG38OG/AA1BUW","filename":"pgd-vote-replication.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata-13","filesize":12842,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14eaadb0528-5b3849ad5493","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4083f521acb8416079c6aac0ca32a2a7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4083f521acb8416079c6aac0ca32a2a7"}}},{"label":"replication-pgd.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":75846,"dataFile":{"id":2694887,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KG38OG/5YUXKQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KG38OG/5YUXKQ","filename":"replication-pgd.do","contentType":"application/x-wine-extension-do","filesize":1158,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14eab32a958-6d75bc15d01d","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"063a27a82668c3d735c0dde2111edb5a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"063a27a82668c3d735c0dde2111edb5a"}}}]}}}
