Residents of New York City were asked to give their opinions of President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, their biggest concern about living in New York City, their confidence in the economic recovery of the city, the likelihood of another terrorist attack on the United States, the threat level of another terrorist attack in New York City as opposed to other big cities, and their confidence in the ability of the United States government to capture Osama bin Laden. Respondents also described their personal images of New York City, indicated how likely they were to carry a cellular phone, and specified the frequency of their air travel before and after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. A series of questions focused on Arab Americans, Muslims, and immigrants from the Middle East in the United States, security at New York City airports, bridges, and tunnels, and New York City's preparedness for dealing with a biological or chemical attack. Those queried also presented their views on the impact of the events of September 11, 2001, on their everyday lives, personal economy, and health, what should be done at the site of the World Trade Center in addition to a memorial, and government-issued warnings about possible terrorist attacks on Americans abroad and in the United States.
