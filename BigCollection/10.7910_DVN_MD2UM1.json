Yet, little is known about the\r\nmechanisms and geographic preconditions underlying their diffusion, particularly\r\nat the global level. In this article, we test a series of hypotheses about the conditions\r\nunder which organizations are most likely to adopt ISO 9000, the internationally\r\nrecognized set of standards for quality management, using panel data for 130\r\ncountries from 1995 to 2001. Our findings support the idea that transnational networks\r\nthat connect different countries at the international level provide conduits for the\r\ncross-national transfer of new organizational practices. Thus, exports to the European\r\nUnion, local involvement of transnational corporations (TNCs), European colonial\r\nties, and the availability of telecommunications all emerge as statistically significant\r\ndeterminants of ISO adoptions. Our findings also underscore the importance of\r\nnational environmental conditions in influencing the receptiveness of organizations\r\nto new practices. A low regulatory burden, a high share of manufacturing\r\nactivity, high rates of secondary school enrollment, and low levels of productivity are\r\npositively correlated with the number of ISO 9000 certificates. We conclude by\r\ndiscussing the implications of our findings for current debates about the mechanisms,\r\npreconditions, and scales of organizational transfer, diffusion, and convergence."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-11"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for Economic Geography (ISO9000).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79199,"dataFile":{"id":2775256,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MD2UM1/JCLDAS","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MD2UM1/JCLDAS","filename":"Article for Economic Geography (ISO9000).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":1299,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15230588f49-84da1e3945dd","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"05786897830cc5919c03441263cb53e2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"05786897830cc5919c03441263cb53e2"}}},{"label":"Article for Economic Geography (ISO9000).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79199,"dataFile":{"id":2775257,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MD2UM1/VV2I1A","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MD2UM1/VV2I1A","filename":"Article for Economic Geography (ISO9000).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":143969,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15230589205-e068df30fbe6","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:zybpzyPAmLGzzXPy0SUiCw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"340d900882ef1cdcbedf415892e63aa1","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"340d900882ef1cdcbedf415892e63aa1"}}}]}}}
