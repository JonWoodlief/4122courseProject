An instructor's handout has also been included. This handout contains the following sections, among others: (1) a brief overview and history of the field of macroeconomics, (2) an exploration of this dataset using descriptive statistics, (3) a discussion of how to test hypotheses about data using t-statistics, (4) a discussion of the testing of relationships within data using correlation, (5) a discussion of the testing of relationships within data using regression, (6) a demonstration of simple regression on estimating growth rates, and (7) a glossary of macroeconomic terms. Information on the United States' macroeconomy from 1929 to 1996 is presented in the dataset. The data are time series data obtained from the national income and product accounts constructed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Variables in the dataset include Gross Domestic Product and its components (investment, consumption, foreign trade, government purchases), price indices, productivity, national income and its components (wages and benefits, proprietor's income, rental income, profits, interest income), the labor force (unemployment rates, wages, racial breakdown data), the money supply (money supply, bank reserves, interest rates), production and stock indices, and federal finances and the budget."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"instructional materials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
