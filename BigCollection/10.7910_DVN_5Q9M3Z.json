The eligibility criteria for participants were based on rates of partner change (commercial sex at least twice in the last week and/or eight times in the last month) and age between 18 and 40 years.  At workshops conducted at each site before the initiation of data collection, outreach\r\nworkers and peer educators of the NGO were oriented about the study. During field visits, they created awareness about the study and encouraged eligible individuals to participate. All FSWs attending the clinic for any reason (STI symptoms, STI checkups, or other reasons) were screened for eligibility criteria. Written or witnessed verbal informed consent was obtained from the individuals found eligible. Trained female investigators from a research agency administered a behavioral questionnaire pertaining to demographics, sexual behavior, condom use, treatment seeking, and past exposure to HIV prevention interventions. detailed clinical history was elicited and clinical examination of the anogenital area including speculum and bimanual examination was carried out by the clinic physician who had been trained on the study protocols. The physicians were trained to elicit signs of cervical infection (cervical discharge, friability, or ectopy) and pelvic inflammatory disease (cervical motion or adnexal tenderness)."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured Questionnaire"}]}},"files":[{"description":"STI Operation Research Study conducted among FSW (By FHI 360)","label":"final stior fsw data FHI360_26 feb 2013_dataverse.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":132265,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2432691,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"final stior fsw data FHI360_26 feb 2013_dataverse.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":924147,"description":"STI Operation Research Study conducted among FSW (By FHI 360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:103327","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:twc17MiBDDU7MfD1ss6E6Q==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3955699178bcc1b3ff6ce266acbfb513","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3955699178bcc1b3ff6ce266acbfb513"}}},{"description":"STI Operation Reserach Study FSW-3A (BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONNAIRE (BASELINE & ENDLINE) Questionnaire (By FHI 360)","label":"FSW Form-3A.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":132265,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2432688,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"FSW Form-3A.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":429633,"description":"STI Operation Reserach Study FSW-3A (BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONNAIRE (BASELINE & ENDLINE) Questionnaire (By FHI 360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:103331","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ae196cda2612603a09d12d88d931e9fb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ae196cda2612603a09d12d88d931e9fb"}}},{"description":"STI Operation Reserach Study FSW-3B (CLINICAL EXAMINATION) Questionnaire (By FHI360)","label":"FSW Form 3B.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":132265,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2432686,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"FSW Form 3B.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":275312,"description":"STI Operation Reserach Study FSW-3B (CLINICAL EXAMINATION) Questionnaire (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:103332","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"74ff033eda855b513f84ac7d9b692af7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"74ff033eda855b513f84ac7d9b692af7"}}},{"description":"Data Dictionary of STI Operation Research Study conducted among FSW by FHI 360 in India","label":"stior fsw data dictionary FHI360_28 feb 2013_dataverse.xls","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":132265,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2432684,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"stior fsw data dictionary FHI360_28 feb 2013_dataverse.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":98816,"description":"Data Dictionary of STI Operation Research Study conducted among FSW by FHI 360 in India","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:103329","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7d70c26ba642037db3cd74ced89c7c79","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7d70c26ba642037db3cd74ced89c7c79"}}}]}}}
