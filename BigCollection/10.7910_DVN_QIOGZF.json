All never married and divorced women were employed, as were about one-half of the married women. The employed women were equally distributed by occupational prestige (Siegel, 1971) into high, medium, and low groupings. Participants were all Caucasian, and were residents of a town in the greater Boston area. The response rate was 76%. Data were collected by personal interview.\r\n<br /><br /> The structured survey instrument was developed empirically, based on content analysis of lengthy open-ended interviews about the rewarding and problematic aspects of the various domains of the participants' lives. These initial interviews are not available at the Murray Research Archive. The structured interviews comprised scales with equal numbers of \"reward\" and \"concern\" items for each domain covered. Major domains included work, marriage, homemaking, children, and the self. Income and health were also assessed. <br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (paper interview data for 231 participants).
