By providing a permanent, international mechanism to hold perpetrators of mass human rights abuse accountable, the ICC is also meant to be a deterrent—to prevent potential genocidaires from committing systematic human rights abuses in the first place. But what if the effect is actually quite the opposite? While advocates of international justice have made conjectures about the effect of the ICC on stopping human rights abuses, the existing scholarship does not empirically test assumptions about the relationship between international criminal justice and violence. This article outlines the causal mechanisms by which the ICC could affect ongoing violence and tests these assumptions using event count models of the relationship between the ICC and the level of violence against civilians in Libya during the 2011 crisis. These analyses suggest that the ICC’s involvement in conflict does have a dampening effect on the level of mass atrocities committed. The results also call for a broad and sustained research agenda on the effect of international accountability efforts on ongoing violence."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Interactions, International"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-10-12"}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"42:4"}}]}]}},"files":[{"label":"LibyaICC_II_Aug8.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":88081,"dataFile":{"id":2902467,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/QMLLSF/X02OEJ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QMLLSF/X02OEJ","filename":"LibyaICC_II_Aug8.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":49672,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:157b738d9ae-32dc60a0138b","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:7FEkihwP4AHWpFY7SZHUog==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"cec15dcf4071001109e8c3036da6639b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"cec15dcf4071001109e8c3036da6639b"}}},{"label":"LibyaICC_II_Hillebrecht_Aug8.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88081,"dataFile":{"id":2902468,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/QMLLSF/GYXJE1","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QMLLSF/GYXJE1","filename":"LibyaICC_II_Hillebrecht_Aug8.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":5259,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:157b738d987-2143515f82f6","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"591ac1e31ecf3abf7b2081e51eaeac94","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"591ac1e31ecf3abf7b2081e51eaeac94"}}}]}}}
