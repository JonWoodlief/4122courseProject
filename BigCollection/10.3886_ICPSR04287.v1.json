BJS  awarded a grant to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to  undertake the census. UIC partnered with the American Society of Crime  Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) and the UIC Survey Research Laboratory  (SRL) to administer the census. The survey instrument was designed by  project staff with input from BJS staff and the ASCLD advisory  committee. The survey was pre-tested with 10 laboratories representing  different sized facilities. ASCLD provided UIC with a mailing list of  469 facilities that self-identified as crime laboratories. Advance  letters were mailed to all laboratories followed by telephone  screening. A total of 39 laboratories were removed from the list  because callers either determined the facility was not a crime  laboratory, was a duplicate listing, or contained faulty contact  information. Following the initial mailing of 430 surveys and a second  round, 218 facilities completed the survey. Twelve labs were  determined to be ineligible. Following extensive follow-up efforts, it  was discovered that the list contained many facilities that did not  meet the project definition of a crime laboratory: \"A laboratory that  employs one or more full-time scientists whose principal function is  the examination of physical evidence for law enforcement agencies and  that provides reports and testimony to courts of law with respect to  such evidence.\" The population subsequently dropped to 351 eligible  laboratories. Completed surveys were obtained from 281  laboratories. In a final effort to improve response, UIC and BJS  developed a reduced length survey instrument that collected basic  information about laboratory operations. In conjunction with  additional telephone calls and e-mails, another 25 laboratories  responded to the shorter survey, for an overall response rate of 87 percent (306/351)."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self-enumerated questionnaire"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"87 percent"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, 2002","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37848,"dataFile":{"id":2630947,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, 2002","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
