Research has documented the connections between the use of  illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol and crime. It has been shown  that (1) a substantial proportion of inmates incarcerated for violent  crimes are substance-involved, (2) the majority of inmates serving  time for property offenses are involved with drugs and alcohol, and  (3) prison and jail inmates have a substantially higher prevalence of  drug use and higher rates of drinking than the general  population. This study sought to present a comprehensive analysis of  the substance use patterns of inmates and the relationship between  substance abuse and the growth in the inmate population. Moreover,  using data from two national surveys on jail and prison inmates  (SURVEY OF INMATES OF LOCAL JAILS, 1996: [UNITED STATES] [ICPSR 6858]  and SURVEY OF INMATES IN STATE AND FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES,  1997 [ICPSR 2598], respectively), this study sought to expand the  analyses of these data in order to fully explore the relationship  between type and intensity of substance abuse and other health and  social problems, analyze access to treatment and services, and make  estimates of the need for different types of treatment services in correctional systems."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This data collection consists of the SPSS syntax  used to recode existing variables and create new variables from the  SURVEY OF INMATES OF LOCAL JAILS, 1996 (Part 1) and the SURVEY OF  INMATES IN STATE AND FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES, 1997 (Part 2).  The SURVEY OF INMATES OF LOCAL JAILS, sponsored by the United States  Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, is collected  every six years and provides nationally representative data on persons  held prior to trial and on convicted offenders serving sentences in  local jails or awaiting transfer to state prisons. Data cover  demographic characteristics of jail inmates (sex, race, ethnicity,  Hispanic origin, employment), current offenses and sentences,  detention status, trial, bail, characteristics of victims, criminal  histories, incident characteristics, socioeconomic circumstances, jail  conditions and activities, and prior drug and alcohol use and  treatment. The SURVEY OF INMATES IN STATE AND FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL  FACILITIES, conducted every five years, is designed by the Bureau of  Justice Statistics and administered by the Bureau of the Census as  part of a series of data-gathering efforts undertaken to assist  policymakers in assessing and remedying defici\nencies in the nation's  correctional institutions. This survey is used to gather nationally  representative data on state prison inmates and sentenced federal  inmates held in federally owned and operated facilities. Through  personal interviews, inmates in both state and federal prisons provide  information about their current offense and sentence, criminal  history, family background and personal characteristics, prior drug  and alcohol use and treatment programs, gun possession and use, gang  membership, and prison activities, programs, and services.
