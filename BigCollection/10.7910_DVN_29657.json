What happens afterwards, however, has not yet been sufficiently explored. This represents a major research gap, as the actual practices of power-sharing in post-conflict countries are likely to be influential in the possibility of civil conflict recurring. To address this shortcoming, we present a new global dataset on the promises and practices of power-sharing between the government of a state and former rebels in post-conflict countries. The collected data captures if, when and how power-sharing institutions have been promised and/or put into place, and whether they have subsequently been modified or abolished. The dataset encompasses every peace agreement signed after the cessation of a civil conflict in the years between 1989 and 2006, and covers a five-year period after the signature of each of these agreements (unless violence recurred earlier). The unit of analysis is the government-Ârebel dyad during the post-conflict period and data is recorded in an event data format. A first analysis of the Power-Sharing Event Dataset (PSED) reveals that the effects of the promises of power-sharing on civil conflict recurrence follow a different logic than the effects of their practices. This finding emphasizes the necessity for in-depth analyses of postconflict situations for which the PSED provides the necessary data."}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Martin Ottmann"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-09-09"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-09-09"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-27"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1989"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Global"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"PSED data (agreement level)","label":"PSED_agreement.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42840,"dataFile":{"id":2548455,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/29657/BY749X","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/29657/BY749X","filename":"PSED_agreement.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":187752,"description":"PSED data (agreement level)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:303119","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fe379d11afccf00c6bc0794795689cf7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fe379d11afccf00c6bc0794795689cf7"}}},{"description":"Codebook","label":"PSED_codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42840,"dataFile":{"id":2548456,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/29657/TPROSX","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/29657/TPROSX","filename":"PSED_codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":125662,"description":"Codebook","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:303120","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7c94ffb22a3d13085df62554544ddb2c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7c94ffb22a3d13085df62554544ddb2c"}}},{"description":"PSED data (dyad level)","label":"PSED_dyad.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42840,"dataFile":{"id":2548454,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/29657/XS446O","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/29657/XS446O","filename":"PSED_dyad.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":213885,"description":"PSED data (dyad level)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:303118","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"111ba78c0bb528d1cd9126db571b633d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"111ba78c0bb528d1cd9126db571b633d"}}}]}}}
