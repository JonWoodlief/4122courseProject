Project researchers randomly collected a 20 percent sample of the 10,895 backlogged sexual assault cases (cases with untested sexual assault kits) at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Los Angeles Sherriff's Department (LASD) to be tested and to evaluate the scientific results achieved by private testing laboratories. After sorting through files and eliminating many due to time constraints, case count fluctuations throughout the course of the data collection, the inability to locate every case file, and removing cases due to the suspects' age, the researchers collected and coded sexual assault case information on 1,948 backlogged cases from 1982 to 2009. Data were also collected on 371 non-backlogged sexual assault cases with sexual assault kits that were tested between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2010. Data collection focused on the respective agencies' crime laboratory files and the DNA reports submitted by outside private testing laboratories. Data collection tools for this project focused on key descriptive, investigative, critical event times/dates, physical evidence, and analytical tests performed on the evidence. Records yielded information on DNA profiles and related Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) submission activity. Criminal justice case disposition information was also collected on a total of 742 cases including a sample of 371 backlogged cases and the 371 non-backlogged cases to examine the impact of evidence contained in sexual assault kits on criminal justice disposition outcomes.

The laboratory records included various documents that informed the creation of the collection tool for this project and included key descriptive, investigative, physical evidence, and analytical tests performed on the evidence. Initially, project staff reviewed a number of case files from both the LASD and the LAPD to develop an understanding of the detail and completeness of information contained in various medical examination and laboratory documents. The objective was to find key descriptive and scientific evidence information that was common to both agencies crime laboratory files and that would describe the types of sexual assaults forming the backlog. After a preliminary review of the files, several attributes were identified that were subsequently included in the data collection tool, including case identifying information and victim medical report items.</p>\n\n<p>Information collected included outsourced laboratory reports prepared by each of the private laboratories contracted by the respective agencies to examine evidence contained in the sexual assault kits as well as sexual assault kit evidence and transmittal forms between law enforcement and testing laboratories, including toxicological samples. Other information collected included Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) eligibility information, CODIS match detail reports, and local DNA Index System (LDIS) detail reports. The CODIS eligibility information identified whether DNA test results were eligible for upload into CODIS, as well as eligibility review date. The CODIS match detail report included whether the uploaded profile resulted in a CODIS match to another profile already in the CODIS system, also known as a \"hit\". The LDIS detail report included the uploaded loci information for CODIS and the upload date, and reported if a full or partial profile was uploaded to CODIS.</p>\n\n<p>The LASD case files contained a copy of the original Office of Criminal Justice Planning (OCJP) medical report completed by medical personnel performing the sexual assault exam on the victim following the assault. The OCJP form described the age, gender and ethnicity of the victim, other self-reported information, and various examination items. The LASD crime laboratory requested that sexual assault investigators complete an audit form/questionnaire supplying certain information on each of the backlogged cases. The LAPD crime laboratory did not include copies of the OCJP form in its case files. Researchers attempted to collect the information contained on this form from other documents contained in the file, including the Serology Item Description Notes, the Request for Serology/DNA Analysis form, the Property Report, and the Investigative Report.

After obtaining the total list of cases in each laboratory's backlog file, the project staff took a 20 percent random sample of each list in September 2010. After obtaining this list, a small number of cases were excluded from the sample, including  cases that were found on the backlog case list, but were actually determined to be non-backlogged. This was indicated if the file did not have a backlog grant sticker on the front of the file, and/or the file did not contain paperwork denoting it as a backlogged file, and/or the sexual assault kit was not outsourced to a private laboratory, and/or the sexual assault kit was processed within the year the crime occurred.  Cases involving suspected juvenile offenders and cases where no external contract laboratory testing was performed were also excluded. The official number of backlogged cases fluctuated slightly throughout the duration of the project.  This was due primarily to the identification of newly discovered back\nlogged cases that had not been counted or registered originally, as well as the elimination of certain cases not meeting the definition of a backlogged case.  Therefore, the initial backlogged population from LAPD reflected 6,157 cases, while the final number the agency reported was 6,132.  Similarly, the initial backlogged population obtained from LASD included 4,694 case files, while their final reported number was 4,763.</p>\n\n<p>Of 6,157 LAPD backlogged cases, a 20 percent random sample yielded a sample size of 1,219 cases, from which 1,141 cases were coded.
