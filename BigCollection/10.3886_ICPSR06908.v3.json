With the goal of remedying the previous lack of state-level data, the survey was conducted to aid in defining problems in the employment-based insurance market and in analyzing the impacts of states' policy options. The survey collected data on characteristics of employers and workers in establishments offering and not offering health insurance, including the number of employees (statewide and nationwide), the distribution of workers by hours worked, age, sex, and earnings, the peak month for seasonal workers, the type of industry or business, whether health insurance was offered, and eligibility rules for health insurance. It also collected information about the characteristics of plans offered, including premiums, cost-sharing, medical underwriting, self-insurance, type of plan, number of days a person must wait for coverage of a preexisting condition, and whether each plan covered prenatal care, maternity care, outpatient prescription drugs, mental health services, dental care, and treatment for alcoholism or drug abuse. The survey also elicited information from employers not offering health insurance as to other forms of compensation for medical expenses they provided to employees. There are three data files in the collection. Part 1, Firms Data, contains information on the surveyed firms. Part 2, Plans Data, has data on each insurance plan offered by these firms. Part 3, FIPS State and County Codes for Firms Data, identifies the state and county of each firm. Parts\n1 and 3 comprise one case per firm, Part 2 one case per insurance plan."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance policies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"private health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA II.
