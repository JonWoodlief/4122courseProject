We assess the role played by ambassadors’ individual characteristics including education, marital status, and the number of children, and host countries’ characteristics, such as quality of life and regime type, in determining if a male or female is appointed to ambassadorial positions to represent the United States in foreign countries. The time frame of this study is the entire presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush (1993-2008), during which a number of 603 career diplomats were appointed as ambassadors. The study provides empirical evidence that there remain significant differences between women and men serving as ambassadors. Female ambassadors are more likely to be single, have no children, and less likely to be Ivy League graduates than male ambassadors. Furthermore, they are more likely to be appointed to countries with lower quality of life and better human rights records. Finally, time plays a role in the likelihood of a woman being appointed as ambassador."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Calin, Costel"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-04-17"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This dataset should be used for replicating the data in Table 1.","label":"All career ambassadors.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136398,"dataFile":{"id":3143754,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/JZOVTE","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/JZOVTE","filename":"All career ambassadors.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":58247,"description":"This dataset should be used for replicating the data in Table 1.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:162d50d33fa-7f4da2e96541","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d46dcfa8dc418ffcd412b24284ab26e3","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d46dcfa8dc418ffcd412b24284ab26e3"}}},{"label":"Do-file Male vs. Female Career Ambassadors.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136398,"dataFile":{"id":3143751,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/XEHCO6","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/XEHCO6","filename":"Do-file Male vs. Female Career Ambassadors.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":3087,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:162d50d6a16-358a5edd0e4f","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2569ac36c614fa1d4063f1a9a1242f62","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2569ac36c614fa1d4063f1a9a1242f62"}}},{"description":"This dataset should be used for replicating the data in Table 2.","label":"Main FPA dataset.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136398,"dataFile":{"id":3143753,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/Y1WDDU","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/Y1WDDU","filename":"Main FPA dataset.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":80023,"description":"This dataset should be used for replicating the data in Table 2.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:162d50cdb33-0ec8cdb6cbde","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f027f2fe875c3cb36fd5b816dae912ca","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f027f2fe875c3cb36fd5b816dae912ca"}}},{"description":"This dataset should be used for replicating the data in Figure 1.","label":"Total number of career ambassadors per year, by sex.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136398,"dataFile":{"id":3143752,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/8ZVWFQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZBJUC/8ZVWFQ","filename":"Total number of career ambassadors per year, by sex.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":2539,"description":"This dataset should be used for replicating the data in Figure 1.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:162d50d564c-9e6c53d347dd","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"8e085742a11ca56b8ca712adaaecc4b7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"8e085742a11ca56b8ca712adaaecc4b7"}}}]}}}
