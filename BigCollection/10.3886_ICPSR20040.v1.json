These assumptions can have major effects on the  conclusions of a particular data analysis. The existing research on  this topic comes to sufficiently differing conclusions, predicated  upon one or more underlying assumptions, to call into question the  ability of any single model to explain the impact of execution  laws. Such dependence on the specifics of research design, from data  cleaning to aggregation to model choice, forms the basis for the use  of averaging techniques. That is, since relatively minor variations in  model or variable choice can lead to dramatic changes in conclusions,  one suspects that inclusion of the information content of all of these  models would lend itself to conclusions upon which policymakers could  be more confident. The purpose of this study was to estimate the  deterrent effect of capital punishment by employing a methodology that  accounted for model uncertainty by integrating various studies into a  single coherent analysis. The research project sought to utilize model  averaging, a method that enables a researcher to take a weighted  average of findings across possible models, to develop inferences that are not dependent on the assumption that one of the models is true."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study replicated the results from two  previous studies and implemented model averaging methods to analyze  deterrence laws. First, this study replicated the results from two  previous studies, Dezhbakhsh, Rubin and Shepherd (2003) and Donohue  and Wolfers (2005), that draw on the same data. Both papers estimated  some version of a deterrence regression drawn from Ehrlich (1977).  That is, the murder rate is a function of three principal deterrence  variables: the probability of arrest, the probability of receiving a  death sentence conditional of being arrested, and the probability of  being executed conditional on receiving a death sentence. Second, the  researchers implemented model averaging methods using standard  frequentist estimators to take a weighted average of the findings  across all possible models that could explain the effect of the  difference in crime rates under alternate laws.
