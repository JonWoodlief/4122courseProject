Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs among members of United States house\nholds aged 12 and older. Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, nonmedical use of prescription drugs including psychotherapeutics, and polysubstance use. Respondents were also asked about their knowledge of drugs, perceptions of the risks involved, population movement, and sequencing of drug use. Fifty-seven percent of respondents were asked specific questions about their perceptions of the consequences of marijuana and alcohol use. The other 43 percent were asked about heroin use among friends. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, income level, and household

The data and codebook were prepared for release by Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, and the codebook was initially distributed by National Opinion Research Center, Chicago, IL, under contracts with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For selected variables, statistical imputation was done following logical imputation to replace missing responses. These variables are identified in the codebook as \"...LOGICALLY IMPUTED\" and \"...imputed\" for the logical procedure or by the designation \"IMPUTATION REVISED\" in the variable label when the statistical procedure\nwas also performed. The names of statistically imputed variables begin with the letters \"IR\". For each imputation-revised variable there is a corresponding imputation indicator variable that indicates whether a case's value on the variable resulted from an interview response or was imputed by the hot-deck technique, which is described in the codebook.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The \"basic sampling weights\" are equal to the inverse of the probabilities of selection of sample respondents. To obtain \"final NHSDA weights,\" the basic weights were adjusted to take into account dwelling unit-level and individual-level nonresponse and further adjusted to ensure consistency with population projections from the United States Bureau of the Census.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: To protect the confidentiality of respondents, all variables that could be used to identify individuals have been encrypted, collapsed, or deleted. These modifications should not affect analytic uses of the data.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: New editing, revised handling of missing data, and different sampling weights were applied to the original 1979 NHSDA data file to make it more comparable with later NHSDAs. This resulted in several differences between the original and public use files. Although differences in prevalence estimates are generally small, published findings of the 1979 NHSDA cannot be replicated using the public use file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The codebook, which includes the data collection instruments, is provided as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For some drugs that have multiple names, questions regarding the use of that drug may be asked for each distinct name.

The two race classifications used were white and Black/other, and the two race/ethnic group choices were white and Black/other. Minorities and younger household members were oversampled. Five age divisions were usually classified into three groups: youth (ages 12 to 17), young adult (ages 18 to 21 and 22 to 25), and older adult (ages 26 to 34 and 35 and older).
