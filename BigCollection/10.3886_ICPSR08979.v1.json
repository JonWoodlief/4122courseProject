In Seattle the sample included regular   judges, adjunct attorneys, and litigating attorneys who responded to a   mailed questionnaire. In Phoenix the sample included civil appeals that   were disposed by adjunct attorneys and judges between 1983 and 1985. In   Connecticut a sample was selected from all the civil cases referred to   the trial reference program in three Superior Courts from January 1984   through June 1985.
