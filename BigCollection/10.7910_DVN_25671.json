(2014) indicates that racial diversity amplify the impact of negative stereotypes on Whites' race-related policy attitudes, and reliance on stereotypes is magnified among low self-monitors (who are true-to-themselves) in diverse context more than high self-monitors (who are concerned about social appropriateness). Building on this work, this article reveals that racial diversity influences white policy attitudes conditional on other social contexts such as residential mobility and racial peer groups' attitudes. Firstly, we argue that quality of inter-racial interaction rather than quantity matters in shaping policy attitudes by showing that Whites' policy opposition in highly diverse areas with high residential turnover is as strong as in low diverse areas with low mobility. Second, we argue that interaction within racial peer groups matters by showing that Whites tend to align their policy attitudes to those of their ideological and economic social reference groups even when racial diversity is salient. More importantly, chameleon-like high self-monitors, who were considered to adjust their policy attitudes to egalitarian social norms in racially diverse context in previous studies, amplify their negative stereotype and strongly oppose these policies when their ideology peer groups oppose race-targeted economic policies."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bautista-Chavez, Angie and Lee, Boram, 2014, \"Social Camouflage and the Conditional Effects of Racial Diversity on Race-Targeted Policies\""}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/resources/images/dvnPoweredByLogo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-05-05"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-05-05"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"BautistaChavez_Lee_Gov2001_Rcode.R","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61196,"categories":["R code"],"dataFile":{"id":2465340,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/25671/8HVM23","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/25671/8HVM23","filename":"BautistaChavez_Lee_Gov2001_Rcode.R","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":63433,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:194234","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"56c645f8363808f2f00082046007d574","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"56c645f8363808f2f00082046007d574"}}},{"description":"","label":"BC_Lee_Paper_Gov2001.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61196,"categories":["Paper"],"dataFile":{"id":2465339,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/25671/ZUL7M0","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/25671/ZUL7M0","filename":"BC_Lee_Paper_Gov2001.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":574136,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:194233","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4d60b352a90e44b0897fd11583832b92","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4d60b352a90e44b0897fd11583832b92"}}},{"description":"","label":"codebook-3.doc","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61196,"categories":["Survey codebook "],"dataFile":{"id":2465338,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/25671/LTCHVO","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/25671/LTCHVO","filename":"codebook-3.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":229888,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:194237","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e354ac92af8ab3a6dfa8b9e3a1cc8961","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e354ac92af8ab3a6dfa8b9e3a1cc8961"}}},{"description":"This dataset does not contain Census variables that we use in the paper.
