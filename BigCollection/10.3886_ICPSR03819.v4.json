It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facili\nties and clients on an average day.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: N-SSATS collects data about facilities, not individual clients. Data on clients represent an aggregate of clients in treatment for each reporting facility.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: N-SSATS attempts to obtain responses from all known treatment and prevention facilities, but it is a voluntary survey. There is no adjustment for facility nonresponse.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: To protect the privacy of respondents, financial data originally collected have been removed from the public use file. These modifications should not affect most analytic uses of the public use file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Previously, data was provided by facilities with a reference date of October 1. A decision was made in 2001 to change the reference date to the last business day of the month in March. This change was made to help increase the timeliness of responses by facilities. The result of this change meant that no data was collected for 2001.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>For users who wish to calculate client counts and admissions, instructions are available on the N-SSATS Series page and at How to calculate N-SSATS client counts and admissions using SDA\n<a href=\"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/support/faqs/2012/09/how-to-correctly-calculate-n-ssats\">http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/SAMHDA/support/faqs/2012/09/how-to-correctly-calculate-n-ssats</a>\n.</p>; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), rda Data file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2004-02-11"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002-03"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002-10"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["mail, telephone, and Web-based surveys"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)"]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["facility"]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) provides the sampling frame for N-SSATS.
