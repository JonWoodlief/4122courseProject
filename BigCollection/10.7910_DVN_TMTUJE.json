All came from a small town in rural Vermont. The subjects comprised two subsamples: children exhibiting hyperkinetic behaviors (although not formally diagnosed with hyperkinesis) and children presenting no hyperkinetic behaviors.<br /><br />  Measures in the study included the Huessy-Marshall Teacher Rating Scale (used in the 2nd, 4th, and 5th grades) and a review of school records (during the student's 9th and 12th grades) to assess activity level, attention span, learning and related problems (Huessy scale at 2nd, 4th, and 5th grade); grade point averages; academic achievement in English, mathematics, science, and social studies, as well as general achievement scores; level of intelligence; and social adjustment (School records in 9th and 12th grade). A structured interview was also used (at the age 21 follow-up) to assess such factors as educational background, employment history, marital status, self-perception, medical history, family background, military service, interactions with police and other authorities, drug use, and satisfaction with life.\r\n<br /><br />  Follow-up is possible with the permission of the
