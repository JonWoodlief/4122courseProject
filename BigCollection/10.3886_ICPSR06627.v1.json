The aim of the study was to obtain basic  information about policies and procedures of probation and parole  agencies with respect to adult sex offender case management.  State  corrections administrators in 49 states and the District of Columbia  were contacted to supply information on their states' probation and  parole offices and the corresponding jurisdictions. From these  offices, probation and parole supervisors at the office-management  level were selected as survey respondents because of their familiarity  with the day-to-day office operations. Respondents were asked about  the usage of various supervision methods, such as electronic  monitoring, requiring offenders on probation or parole to register  with law enforcement agencies, and polygraph testing. Sanctions such  as requiring the offenders to seek treatment and forbidding contact  with the victim were discussed, as were various queries about the  handling of the victim in the case (whether a written statement by the  victim was routinely included in the offender's file, whether officers  usually had contact with the victim, and whether there was a system  for advising victims of status changes for the offender). Other  questions focused on whether the office used specialized assessments,  caseloads, programs, and policies for sex offenders that differed from  those used for other offenders. Various issues regarding treatment for  offenders were also examined: who chooses and pays the treatment  provider, whether the agency or the court approves treatment  providers, what criteria are involved in approval, and whether the office had an in-house sex offender treatment program."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was designed to examine various ways  states approach and sanction sex crimes (i.e., child sexual abuse,  incest, and sexual assault).

A telephone  survey was selected as the method most likely to ensure data quality  and target the correct respondent. The survey instrument, a mixture of  Likert scale questions, dichotomous (yes/no) questions, and open-ended  questions, was pre-tested at several sites in April 1994.  Subsequently, modifications were made to improve the instrument. Then  a team of three interviewers who had experience working in the  criminal justice system was selected to conduct the telephone survey,  which was conducted from offices at the Colorado Division of Criminal  Justice in Denver. The interviewers underwent extensive in-house  training in a week-long program that included in-depth coverage of the  content of the questionnaire and mock telephone interviews. Names of  state correctional administrators were obtained from the 1992-1994  AMERICAN CORRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION PROBATION AND PAROLE DIRECTORY and  the American Probation and Parole Association member list. The state  correctional administrators were telephoned and asked to provide a  list of probation and parole offices in their state and the  corresponding jurisdictions. Based on these lists, offices were  assigned, according to county(s), to one of four quadrants wi\nthin each  state. Probation and parole supervisors at the office-management level  were randomly selected to be interviewed from the quadrant-office  lists (per population density). The office supervisors were selected  as survey respondents because of their familiarity with the day-to-day office operations."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Respondents were asked about the usage of various  supervision methods, such as electronic monitoring, requiring  offenders on probation or parole to register with law enforcement  agencies, and polygraph testing.
