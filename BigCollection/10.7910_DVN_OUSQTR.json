The study finds that a\r\ndemocratic regime, a left-wing oriented government, regional peer influence, and a high level of\r\neconomic development speed up ratification. A legal system built on common law and, if less\r\nrobustly, ethnic fractionalisation lower the likelihood of ratification. These results are compared\r\nto the determinants of domestic death penalty abolition. Besides similarities, one striking\r\ndifference is that Eastern European country membership in the Council of Europe has been\r\nimportant for domestic abolition, but has had no influence on ratification of the Second Optional\r\nProtocol. Western European countries exerted pressure on Eastern European countries to abolish\r\nthe death penalty, but did not extend their pressure towards a ratification of the Second Protocol.\r\nAlso, whereas economic development does not matter for domestic abolition, an internationally\r\nbinding commitment to abolition becomes more likely the richer the country.\r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-02-19"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for Journal of International Human Rights.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124249,"dataFile":{"id":3001782,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OUSQTR/JTSACX","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OUSQTR/JTSACX","filename":"Article for Journal of International Human Rights.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":3069,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a56867e30-7d4303cad196","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6960b250bfb2673d2c87b53e7672e164","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6960b250bfb2673d2c87b53e7672e164"}}},{"label":"Article for Journal of International Human Rights.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":124249,"dataFile":{"id":3001781,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OUSQTR/TM3NLR","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OUSQTR/TM3NLR","filename":"Article for Journal of International Human Rights.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":673028,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a56867a8c-02c72faea0bc","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:YPcGihhmkRr8P+U0sIVDHw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"bf8513ce2105112fc33d0b5031da55c6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"bf8513ce2105112fc33d0b5031da55c6"}}}]}}}
