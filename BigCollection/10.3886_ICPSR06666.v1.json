In addition, respondents described their work   and employment status, activities they performed, how they felt about   what they did, and the kind of relationship they had with their   supervisors. Respondents als\no answered questions related to household   and family, such as how many people lived in the household, what kind   of child care they used, and how much they participated in household   activities like cooking, shopping, laundry, repairs, and bill-paying.
