Given the multicultural and large concentration of female sex workers (FSWs)  and male sex workers (MSWs) with heightened vulnerabilities, the Aastha HIV/STI prevention programme was initiated in 2004 with technical guidance from FHI 360 in Mumbai and Thane districts of Maharashtra, under the Avahan India program.  The specific objectives of the BTS are to collect the following data: Firstly, to measure the current level of behaviors of sex workers among female sex workers and male sex workers covered by Aastha interventions. Secondly, to measure the factors influencing the behaviors of sex workers outcomes; and thirdly, to measure level of individual and group collectivization to reduce the vulnerability among the sex workers in Aastha intervention areas of Mumbai and Thane."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Community mobilization, HIV/STI prevention, MSWs, Treatment seeking behavior; INSTITUTION: FHI360; STRATEGIC AREAS: FSWs, High risk MSM"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gaikwad SB, Bhende A, Nidhi G, Saggurti N, Ranebennur V.

A sample size of 400 FSWs/MSWs was estimated  based on the desire to detect changes of 10-15% with e\r\nstimated baseline values of 50% of (which yield the biggest sample size), and alpha level of 0.05 for one-sided 95% confidence in the observed estimates. Beta levels were set at 0.1 corresponding to 90% power to detect differences/changes if any exist. Survey respondents included women who were 18 years who had sex in exchange of cash/kind in the 1 month prior to the survey. The Aastha project actively registers each FSWs/MSWs in all sites and provides weekly services. Sex workers migrating do not remain in the demonstration data and new sex workers are added within a week of entering any site. Thus, registration includes sex workers physically present and receiving services. Sex workers for the survey were chosen from the programme registration data. Prior to sampling, the registration data were verified in the field to obtain the active status of sex workers in the registered list. The list of active members in each cluster (programme implementation area) formed the sampling frame, and FSWs/MSWs were selected using a Stratified, Systematic Random Sampling procedure."}]}},"files":[{"description":"FSW Data, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","label":"BTS I FHI FSW  2010 Final.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131362,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2504078,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"BTS I FHI FSW  2010 Final.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3929588,"description":"FSW Data, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:243443","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:HtsSzLRVHkAqEvn2IkT50Q==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f03434dc39491019a3c2de9d9cfa1bf9","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f03434dc39491019a3c2de9d9cfa1bf9"}}},{"description":"MSW Data, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","label":"BTS I FHI MSW 2010 Final.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131362,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2504079,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"BTS I FHI MSW 2010 Final.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":658050,"description":"MSW Data, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:243444","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:QNEv6FDvPthoypNywt6+Mg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"c0fe65ea9484e5561b73f760fc976922","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"c0fe65ea9484e5561b73f760fc976922"}}},{"description":"MSW Questionnaire, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","label":"BTS I Final MSW Questionnaire 2010.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131362,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2504077,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"BTS I Final MSW Questionnaire 2010.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":431648,"description":"MSW Questionnaire, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:243442","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"50a0abde7e51a385c34a7e2b68a67fdb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"50a0abde7e51a385c34a7e2b68a67fdb"}}},{"description":"FSW Questionnaire, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","label":"FHI BTS QNR 2010-FSW.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131362,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2504076,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"FHI BTS QNR 2010-FSW.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":507918,"description":"FSW Questionnaire, BTS, 2010 (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:243441","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"bea4bfd99cc2e6bbaf6bae261cb9871e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"bea4bfd99cc2e6bbaf6bae261cb9871e"}}}]}}}
