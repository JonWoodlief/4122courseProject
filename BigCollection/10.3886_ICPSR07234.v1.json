Interviewing was  conducted in four waves: the first wave in 1963, an election-free  year, and the next three waves subsequent to the general elections in  1964, 1966, and 1970. The present study contains the data resulting  from the 1966 electorate sample. POLITICAL CHANGE IN BRITAIN, 1963  (ICPSR 7232) presents data obtained from the 1963 national  cross-section sample, POLITICAL CHANGE IN BRITAIN, 1964 (ICPSR 7233)  includes the interviews administered to the 1964 electorate sample,  and POLITICAL CHANGE IN BRITAIN, 1963-1970 (ICPSR 7250) comprises the  master file that brings together the 1963, 1964, and 1966 samples as  well as 11 additional panels. The interviews focused on the  phenomenon of political change. General political attitudes and  behaviors were ascertained, as well as possible sources for their  change. Variables assessed respondents' sources of political  information, perceptions of political parties and leaders, and views  on governmental responsiveness, economic well-being, and other salient  issues. Other questions probed partisan self-identification and the  extent of political participation. The respondents' knowledge of  members of parliament from their constituencies, and perceptions of  social class and trade-union influence were also  investigated. Semantic differential scales were employed to assess  respondents' perceptions of the three main parties. Extensive  demographic data were collected, including age, sex, marital status, number of children, religion, education, occupation, and income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"party leaders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political affiliation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political perceptions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.A.2.b.
