Information in Parts 1-3, Company Data, was collected primarily from United States Department of Labor Form 5500 data tapes. All companies with at least 100 employees in an employee benefit plan are required to submit Form 5500. These three data files indicate the ESOP status of all companies eligible to have an ESOP during the period 1982-1991, as well as company name, calendar year in which the plan ended, ZIP code, county, metropolitan statistical area, and state in which the company headquarters was located, the company's industry code, and number of employees. There are 358,066 total observations. The data from the Company files were modified in two ways to produce Parts 4-6, the \"Modeling\" data files. First, only one observation per company was kept. Second, companies were linked via their Standard Industrial Classification two-digit industry codes to characteristics of their industries, and via their ZIP codes to characteristics of their locations. Part 4, Modeling Data, Previous, covers companies that adopted an ESOP between 1982 and 1991 and previously had a different pension benefit plan in place. Part 5, Modeling Data, New, includes companies that adopted an ESOP as a first pension benefit plan sometime during the study period. Part 6, Modeling Data, Annual, is a subset of the \"New\" file and also contains companies that adopted an ESOP as their first plan, but only those for which the exact year of ESOP adoption was known. Conditions in the industries and regions in which the company headquarters were located were compared to ESOP adoption rates and averaged over the entire study period for companies in the \"New\" file, while the measurements were made on a yearly basis in the \"Annual\" file. In all three Modeling Data files, information on industry characteristics was recorded, including unemployment, changes in output per worker, industry wages, union membership, the founding year of the company's oldest retirement plan, and industry work force occupations. Information was also collected on the population of the metropolitan area of each firm's headquarters. Topics covered include age, education, fluctuations in local wages, union membership, percentage of families living in poverty, unemployment rate, and local companies with an ESOP."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"stocks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
