If it does, is it because of their coercive military capacity or for other reasons such as their roles in monitoring and reporting violent atrocities? To explore these questions, I study the deployment of peacekeeping units in Darfur and its impact on violence against civilians. Using original geocoded data of UN deployments before and after the intervention, I examine what aspects of such deployment impact one-sided civilian killings by government and rebel groups. Results indicate that deploying UN peacekeepers in an area restrains belligerent from targeting civilians. But results also show that the military capacity of the peacekeepers is not a significant factor in lowering civilian killings. While their ability to defend themselves is extremely important for peacekeepers, these findings caution against the militarization trend in UN peacekeeping and seek to re-shift focus on other substantive aspects of peacekeeping."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Peacekeeping/Peacebuilding, United Nations, Civil war, Conflict, Darfur"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Interactions, International"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-02-12"}]}},"files":[{"label":"final_darfur_dataset.csv","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":150282,"dataFile":{"id":3357539,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"final_darfur_dataset.csv","contentType":"text/csv","filesize":205992,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168e24f22cf-abf6e6bad7d3","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3f9e4bdeaa5f75c83f936f2a2ced86c8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3f9e4bdeaa5f75c83f936f2a2ced86c8"}}},{"label":"unamid_analysis_final_script_2.1.2019.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":150282,"dataFile":{"id":3357540,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"unamid_analysis_final_script_2.1.2019.txt","contentType":"text/plain","filesize":7626,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168e24f169a-e586e3ccd171","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"25f41710dd9c159b30d505f050a41068","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"25f41710dd9c159b30d505f050a41068"}}}]}}}
