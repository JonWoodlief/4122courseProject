More specifically, in order to create the dataset, the principal investigators defined a detailed exhaustive set of client attributes (based on availability across the three data sources) as a base data set. The attributes that defined the synthetic database included all characteristics available for all the databases used in this study. A synthetic dataset of 40,320 client profiles with the attributes and categories that include age, race, gender, current offense, criminal history, drug treatment history, history of violence, current criminal justice status, co-occurring alcohol problem, and geographic location was created. The base synthetic dataset was a cross combination of all of these attributes. Each profile in the dataset was a list of attribute combinations that represented one row in the dataset. The next step was to determine how many individuals in the population were represented by each profile. For each profile, a value was estimated that was used for weighting the profile by its prevalence in the population of interest. Moreover, since the project was interested in assessing the prevalence of potential clients at risk of drug dependence or abuse, prevalence estimates were generated conditional on drug dependence or abuse. Independently of the profilesâ€™ prevalence, the project also generated estimates of the expected crime reducing benefits of treating potential clients under various treatment modalities. This information was obtained from DATOS, and the principal investigators interpolated all expected outcomes of treatment onto the profiles in the synthetic dataset.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include age, race, gender, offense, history of violence, history of treatment, co-occurring alcohol problem, criminal justice system status, geographic location, arrest history, and a total of 134 prevalence and treatment effect estimates and variances.

To construct the sample of 40,320 profiles, the principal investigators defined a potential client of a therapeutic jurisprudence program as any arrestee who was probably guilty of a crime and was also at risk of substance abuse. To determine the nature of the arrestee's substance use, they used the DSM-IV criteria to assess whether or not a drug involved offender was at risk of being dependent on drugs or of abusing drugs. The principal investigators also included a set of client attributes (e.g., age, race, gender) as traits to be included in the design of the synthetic data, e.g., as attributes along which dependency may vary. The analyses were performed on profiles that represent types of individuals, rather than on individual observations. Because information was combined from multiple data sources, it was not possible to observe information about the same individuals describing their risk, dependence, and responsiveness to treatment. Since it was possible to observe common attributes -- socio-demographic characteristics and information about substance abuse and criminal histories across datasets -- simulated (synthetic) profiles were created. These profiles, which are combinations of all attributes, were then used in the analysis in much the same way individual observations would be used had that information been available. From these multiple data sources, the principal investigators developed an exhaustive set of \"profiles,\" where each profile was one possible combination of all of the potential client's attributes. Hence, the synthetic data used in this analysis included a profile for every client permutation, allowing the project to quantify the effect of drug treatment on every combination of client attributes and characteristics. Simulation models were used to estimate outcomes for each profile, conditional on receiving each of four possible treatment modalities.
