The ecosystem of these woodlands serves as a carbon sink and source containing majority of the above-ground terrestrial organic carbon. The study assessed forest cover, stocking parameters and above-ground tree biomass dynamics in the Miombo woodlands of Bereku and Duru Haitemba in Tanzania. The data were obtained from conventional forest inventory and remote sensing and GIS techniques. Results showed that forest cover has increased for the two consecutive assessment period of 1988 – 2000 and 2000 – 2009, mostly by higher canopy cover of 6.82% and 0.79% respectively. Stocking parameters were found to be N (1909.5±9.4), G (12.3±0.6) and V (71.0±6.8). Vegetation indices (NDVI, ARVI and ND54) were then combined with forest inventory data for computation of average above ground biomass which were found to increase from 64±6.53 t/ha, 67.8 ±5.42 t/ha and 79.218±2.75 t/ha for 1988, 2000 and 2009 respectively. The results suggest that, the Miombo woodland resources have been consistently improving over the years of assessment. This could be attributed to reduction in negative anthropogenic factors that are known to be the major cause of resources degradation in Miombo woodlands. However, this improvement may be partial as plot level information revealed higher exploitation of the dbh class of 4 – 5 cm. Increase of management effectiveness through involvement of local people under participatory forest management, strengthened bylaws and provision of other incentives might have contributed greatly to the improvement of the f\norest resources."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Forest Resources Management"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Forest inventory"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Remote Sensing"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Above Ground Biomass stock"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Forest Ecosystem"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Kashindye A., Mtalo E., Mpanda M., Liwa E. and Giliba R.
