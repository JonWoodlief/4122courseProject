This  combination of local, state, and federal arrest records, along with  local and state custody records, provides a more complete criminal  history database for researchers than previously available. In  particular, the inclusion of local custody records allows the  measurement of actual jail time served, including readmissions for  probation and parole violations. It is hoped that the inclusion of  jail incarceration data significantly improves the estimation of an incapacitation effect."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Arrest information was compiled using data from  three databases. MOTION is a regional arrest history system used by  New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) personnel that records all  nonfederal arrests made by five nonfederal agencies in New Orleans.  The NOPD juvenile division enters all juvenile arrests for New Orleans  only into the MOTION system. FINDEX is the Louisiana Department of  Public Safety (State Police) state and national arrest history system  that records all arrests made in Louisiana for which a fingerprint  card has been submitted and accepted, and includes FBI rap sheet  information on out-of-state arrests prior to the last recorded  Louisiana FINDEX arrest. Commitment charges for juveniles in other  parishes from the JIRMS system, the corrections information system  used by the Louisiana Department of Corrections Juvenile Division, are  used in lieu of arrest data. Custody information was drawn from CAJUN,  STARS, and JIRMS data. CAJUN, the Louisiana Department of Corrections  adult penitentiary and probation/parole information system,  indentifies individuals by a state identification number  (SID#). Multiple incarcerations are maintained under a single number.  The New Orleans Criminal Sheriff Department jail information  management system, STARS, maintains records at the incarceration event  level so that each record represents a single term of jail  incarceration. STARS includes a \"TYPE\" field which indicates the  charge status of the individual at the time of release. The following  series of procedures was performed to link databases, to identify all  criminal justice contacts for an individual, and to reduce false  negative errors while holding false positive errors to a minimum: (a)  STARS records were matched to\nMOTION-identified individuals with  computer algorithms, and then MOTION records were searched to identify  duplicates. A unique case number was subsequently assigned to each  individual identified through the matching procedures. (b) CAJUN  master records were matched to study database records. (c) The study  database was then matched to FINDEX. The CAJUN and MOTION databases  were searched for a SID# and added to the study database. Then the  appropriate FINDEX records were linked to the study database. Further  matches were made using the combinations of FBI#, SSN#, name, race,  sex, and date of birth used in the MOTION-to-STARS matching process.  (d) JIRMS was then matched to FINDEX and the study database. Juvenile  records were matched using name, race, sex, and date of birth.  Transitional charge and custody files were created, merging the five  databases based on the links established by the matching  procedures. Of the final sample of 22,561 offenders, 18,734 had FINDEX  records, 11,203 had CAJUN records, and 722 had JIRMS records. The  Charge Data file (Part 4) was created with information from the  MOTION, FINDEX, and JIRMS databases, and the Custody Data file (Part 5) was compiled with data from the CAJUN, STARS and JIRMS systems."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"(1) Juvenile Data File: This file contains  information on juveniles only, with each record corresponding to one  period of juvenile custody.
