An important part of the investigation was to place these political organizations into categories based on the nature of their functions, the interests represented, and, in many cases, their organizational structure. In contrast to most studies of organized interests that rely on highly aggregated categories, this study deliberately proliferated the number of categories in order to capture fine distinctions. In spite of the large number of categories, there were, inevitably, organizations that seemed to fit comfortably into more than one category. To accommodate such cases -- for example, the National Medical Association, Mothers against Drunk Driving, or the American Indian Higher Education Consortium -- the study permits an organization to be coded into as many as three categories. Thus, the NMA, a membership group of African-American physicians, was coded as both a professional association and an African-American organization. Organizations that were coded into two or three categories appear a corresponding number of times in the data. Thus, if an organization was coded as belonging to two categories, it appears twice in this data set, once for each category to which it was assigned. In order to correct for such multiple counting, it is necessary to apply weights. For additional information on weights, please refer to the Original P.I.
