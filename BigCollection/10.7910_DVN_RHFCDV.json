First, `dirtier' economies should improve their environment efficiency faster as they\r\nadopt environmentally sound technologies and policies similar to those in `cleaner' countries, resulting\r\nin catch-up and convergence over time. Second, transnational linkages accelerate the international\r\nspread of environmentally beneficial innovations and, therefore, improvements in environment\r\nefficiency. To test these claims, we use econometric techniques to examine the dynamics and determinants\r\nof two pollutants CO2 and SO2 using a panel comprising up to 114 countries over the\r\nperiod 1980 - 2000. Our empirical findings broadly support both claims. Applying tests of unconditional\r\nconvergence, we find robust evidence for convergence in levels of CO2 and SO2 efficiency,\r\nindicating catch-up by less pollution-efficient economies over time. Similarly, confirming claims\r\nabout transnational linkages, we find that imports from more pollution-efficient countries and\r\ntelecommunications connectivity are associated with faster improvements in domestic CO2 and SO2\r\nefficiency. Results also suggest that inward foreign direct investment is positively associated with\r\nCO2 efficiency. Yet we find that exports to countries with high levels of pollution efficiency have\r\nno discernable effect on domestic pollution efficiency"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-21"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for EPA (efficiency).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79365,"dataFile":{"id":2776324,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RHFCDV/SSVOTI","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RHFCDV/SSVOTI","filename":"Article for EPA (efficiency).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":3406,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1526401d807-d4e65ac99bf2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"020f42d5c75b14966fd458e2345c69e8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"020f42d5c75b14966fd458e2345c69e8"}}},{"label":"Article for EPA (efficiency).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79365,"dataFile":{"id":2776325,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RHFCDV/2TA00B","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RHFCDV/2TA00B","filename":"Article for EPA (efficiency).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":769280,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1526401ebc3-0d8aff35d9b7","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:YLne9DXy1lYsHklzmyP98A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"89e4d1b0320c8efa59b391d62a0b064b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"89e4d1b0320c8efa59b391d62a0b064b"}}}]}}}
