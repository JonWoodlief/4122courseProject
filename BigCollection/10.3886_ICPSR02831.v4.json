Those surveyed were asked if they used  \"information society\" items such as satellite dishes, video recorders,  computers, fax machines, fax modems, portable telephones, the  Internet, pagers, and cable television, either at home for leisure or  at work, and if they planned on purchasing such items. In addition,  respondents were given several examples of services accessible through  communication networks such as the Internet and television and asked  if they would be interested in using these services. Examples included  taking part in political debates with a politician, getting a doctor's  advice on a health problem, planning a complete trip, reading  newspapers, conducting job searches, and managing bank accounts. Food  quality questions in this survey asked respondents how often their  households purchased food items such as cheese, cooked meat, fruit,  vegetables, honey, meat or poultry, pre-cooked meals, and beer. They  were asked which was most important to take into account when buying  the aforementioned products: the brand label, the quality label, the  look of the product, the type of outlet where it was purchased, date  stamps, or the product's traditional character. Respondents also  defined their ideal for a quality food product. Other questions on  this topic probed for respondent opinions on various product labels  such as \"designation of origin,\" \"protected designation of origin,\"  and \"protected geographical indication\" labels. Respondents were asked  if they had ever seen or heard of any of these\nlabels, where they had  seen them, and what the labels meant to them. The survey also  addressed the topic of the family in detail. Respondents were asked to  list factors that influenced the number of children that people might  wish to have, and to comment on the main roles of family in society  and whether they were in favor of or against marriage and why. Those  queried were also asked what the government's top priority should be  in order to improve family life. In addition, respondents were asked  whether marriage or having children changed their lives at all, and  which areas, such as child care, health care, education, and the  environment, should be taken care of by the government, by private  companies, or by associations. Another topic in the survey addressed  aid to developing countries. Respondents answered questions on whether  it was important to help the people in poor countries and which nation  was in the best position to aid poor countries. They were asked if  this aid should increase or decrease and whether development aid  provided by the European Community contributed to solving problems  such as drugs, overpopulation, immigration, environment and pollution,  and trade development. Respondents in Italy were asked to rate Italy's  economic efficiency, and to comment on Italy's commitment to the  European Union, the reliability of Italy in business, and the main  political and economic obstacles for Italy in taking a stronger role  in the European Union. Demographic and other background information  provided includes respondents' age, sex, nationality, marital status,  and left-right political self-placement, as well as household income,  number of people residing in the home, occupation, size of locality, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"developing nations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European unification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign aid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information technology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Internet"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.

(2) The fieldwork dates in the study title  (November-December 1998) are not consistent with the fieldwork dates  provided by the data producer in the technical specifications attached  to the questionnaire and with the fieldwork dates in the data  file. Both these sources indicate that the study was done between  October 29 and December 10, 1998. (3) One respondent (interview number  70177) who answered \"other countries\" to the question about  nationality (Q.1) was permitted to complete interviews. If desired,  this case can be excluded from analysis. (4) D8/V685-V686: For 18  respondents, the indicated age \"when stopped full-time education\" was  too high for their actual age (D11/V688). These cases were recoded to  '0' (NA) in V685 and V686. (5) The fieldwork dates in the data file  for Sweden and Northern Ireland are not consistent with fieldwork  dates provided by the International Research Associates (Europe) in  the technical specification attached to the questionnaire. (6) The  setup files contain references to Norway, but Norway was not a  participant in this wave of Eurobarometer surveys and this collection  contains no data for Norway. (7) Starting with Eurobarometer 34 and up  to survey 61, NUTS 1 level data (REGION II) for the NETHERLANDS are  not (re-)coded in accordance with the official EUROSTAT nomenclature  of territorial unit statistics. The NUTS 2 level province ZEELAND  should be coded as belonging to NUTS 1 region (landsdel) WEST instead  of SOUTH Netherlands. (ZA editions will be corrected from EB 53  onwards, November 11, 2005) (8) The SPSS, SAS, and setup files for  this collection contain characters with diacritical marks used in many  European languages. (9) C4/V771: System missing cases which indicate a  current profession in D21A (V697) have been recoded accordingly. (10)  D13/V692 (N OF CHILDREN UNDER 15 IN HH): For Sweden cases with system  missing were recoded to '0' (NONE) since no other code was provided  for this category, it should be read \"NONE/NA\" for Sweden. (11)  D29/V714 (INCOME HH - SWEDEN): System missing (1 case) was recoded to  '97' (REFUSAL).
