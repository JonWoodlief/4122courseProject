Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, foreign policy, and the economy, as well as their views on United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) involvement in the Kosovo\nwar between the Albanians and the Serbs. Respondents were asked if they favored or opposed the air strikes, if NATO and the United States should continue to bomb until Serbian troops withdrew from Kosovo, and if the bombing of Kosovo would have a negative impact on the United States' relationship with Russia and with Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Respondents were also asked if they followed news coverage of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, if they thought the United States should apologize for the bombing, and if the bombing would have a negative impact on the United States' relationship with China. Additional questions covered whether respondents believed Social Security benefits would be available when they retired, and if respondents had pension plans or 401K accounts from their employers. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, political party, political orientation, voter participation history, marital status, age of children in household, family income, and computer access."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
