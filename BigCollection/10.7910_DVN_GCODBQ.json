There are columns indicating the diameter at breast height ('dbh' – cm).\r\nTo determine the density and abundance of the selected species within the concession and around the villages, trees were identified and sampled on plots. Within the concessions, sample plots were established in the 2012 cutting area. Five plots of 5 ha each were established at random within each of the four quadrants (North, South, East and West) of the 5 000 ha cutting area, for a total of 20 sample plots.  To evaluate the density of trees around villages, 21 sample plots of 5 ha each were laid out around each village along three transects extending from the village centre towards the forest concession to a maximum distance of 10 km. The total sample area described a half circle of 157 km2 (15,700 ha). The central transect (“B”) was oriented towards the forest concession and the transects “A” and “C” were laid out at 450 C to each side of it (Figure 2).  Sample plots around villages were also stratified among four different distance bands, 1-1.9 km (stratum A), 2-3.9 km (stratum B), 4-6.9 km (stratum C) and 7-10 km (stratum D) from the village centre. To obtain a sampling intensity of 0.5% in each stratum, the number of plots per stratum increased in each band of increasing distance. In both the concession and around villages, sample plots were 100 m x 500 m in size. Around villages, plot boundaries extended 100 m along the transect line and 500 m to one side or the other, alternating. Within each plot, all individuals of target species (dbh ≥ 20 cm) were identified and their diameters at breast height (dbh) measured using diameter tapes. When trees had buttresses, diameters were measured at 50 cm above the buttresses with GPS coordinates recorded at each corner of the sampled plots. Stumps were also sought, identified and measured. \r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences","Earth and Environmental Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NON-WOOD FOREST PRODUCTS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LOGGING"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CONTRACTS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LICENSES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"TREES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"POPULATION DENSITY"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Noutcheu, R.; Snook, L.K.; Tchatat, M.; Taedoumg, H.; Tchingsabe, O.; Tieguhong, J.C.
