AWD not only conserves water but also mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. The global climate influence of gases, particularly methane, and resulting reduction in methane emissions by adjusted water management practice through AWD may provide the means for rice to adapt to water scarcity and at the same time mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. With these associated benefits, AWD technology could be harnessed for a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). This paper will discuss the merits of AWD and explore the possibility of being a CDM for areas affected by water shortage in the Angat dam and reservoir."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rice"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: null  Type: CESD  Notes: ;"},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IRRI Technical Bulletin"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"International Rice Research Institute"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jean Sabado"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-12-10"},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Bouman BAM, Lampayan RM, Tuong TP. 2007.
