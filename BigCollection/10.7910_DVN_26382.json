The papers rely on multiple sources of data, though the majority comes from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database. At the time analysis was performed, the WDI data used corresponded to the September 2011 version of the downloaded WDI database. However, since the analysis was carried out, the researcher responsible for data management became aware of a real time WDI database accessible through STATA known as wbopendata (see http://data.worldbank.org/developers/apps/wbopendata).  Results from the paper correspond to the data available in the September 2011 version of the downloadable WDI, so running the analysis using the wbopendata module will yield slightly different results. Additional details about data use and methodology are available in the main do files corresponding to the analysis for the papers, \"CGD MDG accomplishments.do\" and \"CGD MDG targets.do.\" This information is also summarized in a .txt file included in the zip files."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Karver J., Kenny C., and Sumner A.
