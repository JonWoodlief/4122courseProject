Respondents were asked to give their  opinions of President Bill Clinton a\nnd his handling of the economy and  foreign policy, and specifically the crises in Haiti and Iraq.  Questions focused on whether sending troops to Haiti was the right  thing to do, whether President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti would  be able to restore a stable government, and how concerned the  respondent was about the United States being involved in Haiti's  domestic turmoil. Other questions covered whether Saddam Hussein's  troops were still a danger to Kuwait and whether the United States  should have continued to fight Iraq in the Persian Gulf War until  Saddam Hussein was removed from power. Opinions were also solicited on  both President Clinton's and former President George Bush's handling  of the situation in Iraq. In addition, respondents were asked about  their expected voting behavior in the upcoming congressional  elections, and whether that vote decision was based on Bill Clinton's  performance in any way. Background information on respondents includes  voter registration status, household composition, vote choice in the  1992 presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
