Note that the \"base\" file is the file that served as the base file for multiple imputation. The five imputed files are labeled with imp as the file stub. These imputed datasets were created with Amelia, as described in the paper. Variable names in the imputed datasets correspond to those in the base file. The exception are variables ending in _cent and that have an \"X\" in the name. The \"_cent\" indicates centered versions of variables created within the imputed dataset. Variables with an \"X\" are multiplicative interactions. There are a couple of variables that might be unclear, since they are factors scores. However, the creation of those variables and their meaning should be clear in the context of the paper and the datasets.
