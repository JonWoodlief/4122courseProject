It collects data on daily  trips including purpose of the trip, means of transportation used,  travel time, vehicle occupancy, driver characteristics, and vehicle  attributes. These data are collected for all personal trips, all  modes and purposes, all trip lengths, all areas of the country, all  days of the week, and all months of the year. Part 1, the Household  File, contains data on the relationship between household members and  demographic information for household members. The file also contains  information on housing characteristics, as well as characteristics of  the block group and census tract. Availability and distance to public  transportation are also included. Part 2, the Person File, contains  information on seat belt use, modes of transportation used for travel  to work, and costs for parking. Part 3, the Vehicle File, contains  data relating to each of the household's vehicles, including whether a  particular household member usually drives the vehicle, when it was  purchased, the vehicle type, and model year. Part 4, the Travel Day  Trip File, contains data about each trip the person made on the  household's randomly assigned travel day. Information was collected  on the purpose of the trip, the number of trips within the trip chain,  where the trip chain started, and the amount of time spent at each  destination. Part 5, the Segmented Travel Day Trip File, contains  data for up to four segments of each segmented travel day trip the  person made on the travel day. The file contains information on the  start time, mode of transportation used, purpose, and duration of each  travel segment. Part 6, the Travel Period File, contains data for  every trip of at least 75 miles one way that the person took during a  14-day period ending on the travel day. The file contains information  on the start date, purpose, and transportation mode used for trip.  New for the 1995 survey was a written diary, used to help respondents  to better remember their travel on their designated travel day, and a  household roster of trips, which was used to assist respondents in  recalling trips made with other household members. New questions  included satisfaction with the nation's transportation system,  reactions to mobility and congestion, perceived difficulties in travel, and use of seat belts."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"automobile use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"commuting (travel)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"driving habits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public transportation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"traffic"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"traffic accidents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"travel"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vehicles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVI.A.
