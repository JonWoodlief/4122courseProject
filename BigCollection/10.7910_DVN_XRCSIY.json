The first phase examined the transition from late childhood into early adolescence using a 2-year longitudinal design. Students were followed from sixth grade in elementary school into the two types of contrasting seventh grade settings: (1) where the children attended the same school from kindergarten through eighth grade; (2) where the child moved from a kindergarten through sixth grade school onto a junior high school. The second phase of the study, which took place over a second 2-year period (ninth and tenth grade), was designed to study the transition into senior high school and to contrast the effects of a double transition in school environment versus a single change in school environments; that is to contrast students who experienced both a junior and senior high school transition to those who moved directly from elementary school to senior high school.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (copies of blank measures used at each data collection).
