The  efficient allocation of control is a necessary condition for the  optimal allocation of resources. Dynamic efficiency in resource  allocation presupposes that control over firms will change hands when  a given allocation becomes suboptimal. Typically, changes in control  are brought about through (successful) tender offers or block  trades. With regard to takeovers, a firm may have two types of value  to consider: First, there is the public value of the firm, which is  the market value of the firm's securities. Second, there may be a  private value of the firm. The private value is the benefit an  investor enjoys from exercising control over the firm. Private control  benefits are most significant for entrepreneurial start-ups, for  established family-owned businesses, and for organizations in whic\nh  personal investors also pursue non-pecuniary goals, such as media  groups or professional sports organizations. Of the legal arrangements  identified in the finance literature, the most significant for wealth  maximization in takeovers are the one share-one vote principle,  majority rule, and mandatory tender offers. The authors analyze the  implications of these three institutional arrangements in a simple  textbook takeover model. The model helps in understanding the optimal  design of a legal environment in which the market for corporate control promotes efficient allocation of capital."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"corporate mergers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"corporate takeovers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"corporations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"investors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
