Researchers of urban social problems  continue to struggle with this question. The racial and ethnic  composition of urban America has changed as a result in large part of  increased immigration over the past 20 years, requiring researchers to  acknowledge the growth of Latino, Asian, and Afro-Caribbean  neighborhoods--many of which are in high crime and high poverty  areas. Despite the growth of studies on race and violence over the  past two decades that have examined this linkage at the national,  metropolitan, and city levels, this issue remains largely overlooked  at the neighborhood level. Many studies of Black or White violence are  no longer reflections of the nature of racial and ethnic population  compositions in many urban communities. The contextual factors that  shape neighborhood-level violence have become important to identify  since these influences might vary when accounting for racial and  ethnic differences in violent crime, even within a single city. This  study examined the violent victimization rate and the factors  influencing ethnic-specific rates of violence for armed robbery and  aggravated assault in the city of Miami. The objective was to better  inform analyses of violent crime by outlining the basic contours of  race/ethnicity (Latino, African American,and Haitian) in a primarily immigrant city by focusing on serious reported non-lethal violence."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The primary unit of observation for this study was  the census tract, or more specifically, the 70 census tracts in the  city of Miami that are comprised of 500 or more residents. Census  tracts were used as neighborhood proxies because research has shown  they are the best unit of analysis below the city level to study the  race and violence connection. The minimum population requirement was  imposed to help stabilize rates of violence crime and avoid the  inclusion of small islands in Biscayne Bay with few residents or  containing upscale high-rise hotels or condominiums. Administrative  records data were obtained from the United States Bureau of the Census,  which provided the 1990 census tract data. These data provide detailed  demographic information such as the number of residents, the  percentage of tract p\nopulation living below the poverty level, racial  and ethnic composition, and a host of other information. The data for  all reported robberies and aggravated assaults for 1997 was obtained  from the city of Miami Police Department Research Unit. The address  for each incident and victim race, surname, age, and gender were  provided in a raw data file, geocoded into the census tract in which  they occurred, aggregated to the tract level, and merged with the census tract information."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For the groups of people identified as Afro  Americans, Latinos, and Haitians, the number who were victims of  aggravated assault and robbery in 1997 are included along with the  assault and robbery rates for each group.
