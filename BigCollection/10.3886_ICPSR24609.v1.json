Demographic variables include sex, age, education level, occupation, household income, religious denomination, frequency of church attendance, membership to labor unions, party identification, left-right self-placement, voter preference in the 2000 presidential and in the 2003 mid-term legislative elections, and whether they are beneficiaries of social programs against poverty."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"n/a"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A total of 5,803 respondents were selected in a systematic manner throughout the day, using 3 different schedules as to allow for data transmission.
