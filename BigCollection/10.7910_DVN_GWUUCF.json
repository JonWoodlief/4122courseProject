Data crucial to the development of regional fish trade needs to be obtained. However, there is paucity of  information  on  market  structure,  products  and  value  of  fish  trade  along  regional  borders  in Africa.  This study therefore investigated fish marketing structure, the marketing actor’s characteristics, fish distribution channels, market profitability and efficiency along the Nigeria-Niger border and Lake Kainji inland fisheries. \r\nA  multistage  sampling  procedure  was  used  in  the  selection  of  respondents  for  this  study. Random  sampling  was  carried  out  in  selecting  four  states  Sokoto,  Katsina,  Jigawa  and  Yobe along the Nigeria-Niger border, Niger state was purposively selected based on its location in the \r\nLake  Kainji  inland  fisheries.  Data  was  collected  from  150  respondents  in  each  of  the  states comprising 50 producers, processors and marketers  each, amounting to 750 with the use of a structured  questionnaire.  Data  on  socio-economic  characteristics,  marketing  operations, marketing  channel,  market  structure,  profitability  and  trade  flow  were  obtained.   Data  were \r\nanalysed  using  descriptive  statistics,  budgetary  indices,  gini  coefficient,  linear  regression, Stochastic production frontier model and ANOVA at α\r\n0.05. There  was  a  predominance  of  male  producers,  marketers  and  processors  in  Katsina  (100.0%, 98.0%, 98.0%), while in Niger state, processors were dominated by women (54.0%). Majority of producers  (36.0%),  processors  (40.0%)  in  Sokoto  state,  marketers  (36.0%)  and  processors (53.0%) in Katsina state;  and processors (50.0%) in Niger were within the age of 31-40 years. \r\nThe  producer-consumer  channel  had  an  efficiency  of  618.47  while  that  for  producer-retailerconsumer channel was 435.85. The minimum and  maximum average volume  (kg) of fish traded within  and  across  the  States  were  for  fried  (882.25±339.15,  730.72±283.39)  and  fresh  fish \r\n(1702.23±978.32; 1673.20±439.88). An average volume (kg) traded of 1386.46±760.57 for dried fish was traded across the regional border. 478.22±292.01 and 91.04±80.53 were the highest and least  marketing  efficiency  among  artisanal  fishermen  and  retailers  respectively  for  fresh  fish. Processors had the highest average gross margin per kg (₦1157.94±492.26) while wholesalers had the least  ₦387.94±363.87  for smoked fish.  The Gini coefficient value for most  of the actors showed partial inequality in the revenue distribution  of  fresh, smoked, dried, fried, spiced and frozen  fish,  except  for  wholesalers  of  smoked  fish  (0.34),  retailers  of  spiced  fish  (0.45)  and iii wholesalers  (0.41)  and retailers  (0.43)  of frozen fish.  The linear regression b values for all the forms  of  fish  were  positive  except  for  dried  and  fried  whose  b  values  were  -7.66  and  -5.15 \r\nrespectively. The  direct  marketing  channels  were  most  efficient  for  fresh  and  processed  fish.  The  market structures  for  most  of  the  producers  (capture),  marketers  and  processors  were  monopolistic  in nature  and there was  barrier into  entry for fried and dried fish.  Therefore there is need for better organization of fish markets.\r\n\r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Marketing  Channels"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Profitability"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Marketing  Efficiency"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gini  coefficient"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Performance"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/sites/default/files/worldfish-logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Muliro, Jacquie"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-04"}]}},"files":[{"description":"STATA data file for the assessment of economic efficient of fish marketing channels and trade flow in the lake kainji","label":"Assessment of economic efficient of fish marketing channels and trade flow in the lake kainji.tab","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":145741,"categories":["6.
