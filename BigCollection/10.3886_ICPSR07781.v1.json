It consists of data collected in the spring of 1978 during a   dress rehearsal for the 1980 United States Census and covers the city   of Richmond, Henrico County, and Chesterfield County, Virginia. The   Dress Rehearsal data were used to create two representative Summary   Tape File 1 (STF1) files for users who wanted to become familiar   with the data format or test and develop software for processing   summary data. The purpose of the dress rehearsal program was to   use the planned final materials and procedures in locations that   simulated various conditions that the Bureau would face in the   1980 Census. The STF1 files are equivalent in content to the combined   1st and 3rd count summary files in the 1970 Census data. They    contain only 100-percent items, and no sample items are present. This study  contains two test files created from the Richmond Dress Rehearsal   data: STF1A and STF1B. They are identical in content and format and   differ only in geographic coverage. STF1A file (Part 1) contains   summaries for the state, counties, minor civil divisions (MCD) or   census county divisions (CCD), places or place segments within   MCD/CCD and remainder of MCD/CCD, tracts or block numbering areas,   and block groups or, for unblocked areas, enumeration districts.   Summaries are also given for places and congressional districts for   the 96th Congress. STF1B file (Part 2) provides summaries for state,   SMSAs, nonSMSA remainder of state, counties, MCDs within counties,   places within MCDs within counties, tracts or block numbering areas   (BNAs), and blocks or, for unblocked areas, enumeration districts.   Summaries are also provided for blocked portions of all geographic   levels. Data are provided for population and housing characteristics.   The housing items include occupancy/vacancy status, tenure, contract   rent, value, condominium status, number of rooms, and plumbing   facilities. Variables on population include demographic items such as   age, race, sex, marital status, Spanish origin, household type, and   household relationship. Selected aggregates, means, and medians are  also provided. This hierarchical data collection contains   approximately 59 variables. STF1A contains 733 records with a   logical record length of 3,276 characters with 2 record segments of   1,638 characters each. STF1B contains 7,278 records with a logical   record length of 3,276 characters with 2 record segments of 1,638   characters each. The data are arrayed in 59 tables consisting of 32l   data cells. One set of documentation is provided to cover both   files.

One type of  analytical limitation of the data is geographic. A second limitation  results from changes in the questionnaire between the Richmond Dress  Rehearsal and the 1980 Census. Although the changes do not affect  the character location or the structure of this dataset, they do affect   the substantive compatibility of STF 1 for the Richmond test and STF 1  for the 1980 Census. The data from the Richmond test were forced into   the 1980 format for STF 1. Consequently, data on the Richmond STF 1   reflect the items on that questionnaire, but the format of the 1980 questionnaire governs the tape layout.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1984-06-28"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1980"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["census/enumeration data and aggregate data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Census of Population and Housing, 1980 [United States] Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["personal interviews, mailback questionnaires, and  self-enumerated questionnaires"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Richmond"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Virginia"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["All persons and housing units in Richmond City, Henrico  County, and Chesterfield County, Virginia, in 1978."]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"STF1A","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":39000,"dataFile":{"id":2642138,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"STF1A","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"STF1B","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":39000,"dataFile":{"id":2642139,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"STF1B","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
