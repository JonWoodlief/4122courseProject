The CCEB provides decision-makers and the  European public with opinion data on the similarities and differences  between the EU and the candidate countries. The CCEB continuously  tracks support for EU membership in each country and records changes  in attitudes related to European issues in the candidate countries.  This round of the CCEB surveys was conducted between October 16 and  November 17, 2002, in the 13 candidate countries: Bulgaria, Cyprus,  Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland,  Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey. Respondents were queried on  whether the EU should use its agricultural policy to ensure stable and  adequate incomes for farmers, help farmers to adapt their production  to consumers' expectations, favor and improve life in the countryside,  reduce development disparities between regions, favor methods of  organic production, promote respect for the environment, protect  medium- or small-sized farms, or ensure that agricultural products  were healthy and safe. Additional questions elicited respondents'  feelings toward the EU subsidizing fewer agricultural products in  favor of providing more funds for the protection and development of  the overall rural economy. Respondents were asked if they had heard  about the \"Common Agricultural Policy,\" and if they felt the  agricultural policy of the European Union would favor farmers,  consumers, the environment in the countryside, or the food-processing  industry. Respondents were also asked what they expected the impact  would be on their farms if their country joined the EU. Demographic  variables include sex, age, nationality, marital status, level of  education, current occupation, income, whether the respondent lived in  a rural area or village, small- or middle-sized town, or large town, religious affiliation, and voting intent."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agriculture"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
