A project of the Public Health Foundation, TRAIN (www.train.org) is a comprehensive learning resource for public health professionals, such as epidemiologists, public health officials, health educators, environmental health professionals, social workers, nurses, physicians, emergency responders, and mental health providers. Learners can use TRAIN to search for on-site and distance learning courses, register on-line for courses, provide and view feedback about courses, and create a personal training record of competency-based training and continuing education requirements. Course providers can use TRAIN to publicize courses, manage online registration and student rosters, collect feedback from learners, and post course materials and discussion topics.</p>\n\n<p>Core Competencies for Public Health Professionals is a set of skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for the broad practice of public health. Adopted by the Council on Linkages Between Academia and Public Health Practice, this list of competencies was incorporated into TRAIN.</p>\n\n<p>Comprising a small subset of the information in the TRAIN database, the three data files were tailored to facilitate public health systems and services research. The first data file contains demographic information about every registered TRAIN learner: street address, county, city, state, ZIP code, country, education level, gender, race, Hispanic origin, birth date, primary language, and secondary language. The second data file is a tabulation which shows the core competencies covered by each course offered through TRAIN, together with the course titles, expiration dates, and the organizations offering the courses. The last data file is a tabulation which shows the number of TRAIN courses and learners by core competency and professional role.</p>\n\n<p>The TRAIN database dictionary describes all of the variables in the TRAIN database, including those not provided with this data collection.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care providers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA I.
