This project grew out of the ICPSR  Training Program, and the underlying pedagogical perspectives matured  in this program. ICPSR's experience strongly underscored the  importance\nof moving the student of quantitative methods out of the  passive mode and actively involving the student in the learning  process. The materials in this study were created to present students  with a sequence of intellectual tasks designed to facilitate their  understanding of the logic and algorithms of various techniques. The  data consist of two subsets, File 1, derived from the CIVIC CULTURE  STUDY, 1959-1960 (ICPSR 7201) and File 2, extracted from the AMERICAN  NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1968 (ICPSR 7281). The accompanying material  consists of a book, APPLIED STATISTICS, by Gudmund R. Iversen, with  two substantive examples by Helmut Norpoth and a chapter co-authored  by Lawrence H. Boyd. Covered topics are regression analysis (simple  and multiple, dummy variables, multicollinearity, analysis of  residuals), analysis of variance and covariance, contingency tables,  Bayesian statistics, and multilevel analysis. A revised manuscript  exists in mimeographed form. The computer output and answers to the  questions included in the book are also available. Similar teaching  materials are also being developed in the areas of causal inference, dimensional analysis, and dynamic analysis."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"instruction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"instructional materials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"statistics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR X.A.3.
