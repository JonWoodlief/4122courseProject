The program is intended to enhance early pediatric  care by incorporating preventive developmental and behavioral services  as part of a comprehensive, whole-child, whole-family model of health  care and to help provide mothers and fathers with the childrearing  information and guidance they seek.</p>\n\n<p>The evaluation of Healthy Steps consisted of three components: the  National Evaluation, the Affiliate Evaluation, and the Embedded  Observational Study. All data contained in these public release data  sets come from the National Evaluation. For additional information on  the Affiliate Evaluation or the Embedded Observational Study, please  visit  http://www.jhsph.edu/WCHPC_/Projects/Healthy_Steps/index.html\n<a href=\"http://www.jhsph.edu/WCHPC_/Projects/Healthy_Steps/index.html\">http://www.jhsph.edu/WCHPC_/Projects/Healthy_Steps/index.html</a>\n.</p>\n\n<p>These data were gathered to assess whether the Healthy Steps  program was successful in reorienting pediatric practice to emphasize  child development issues in increasing parents' knowledge about early  nurturing of infants and parents' involvement in their children's  development and in promoting parents' practices that improve the  health, safety, and health care utilization of their children.</p>\n\n<p>The data are organized as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Forms: Newborn</strong></p>\n\n<p>The newborn form was used to gather data on the baby's characteristics,   demographic characteristics of the mother, father, and family, prenatal   utilization of services, health behaviors of the mother and father, and  parents' decisions about a pediatric provider for their newborn.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Forms: 6 Month</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 6 month form was used to gather information on selected family  demographic characteristics, child's health, parenting practices, and   health behaviors of the mother and father. Questions included the  frequency of injuries, emergency department visits, and hospitalization  in the past 6 months, use of safety devices, activities that promote  learning and development, sources of information on speech development,  child care arrangements, smoking practices, and mother's receipt of  postpartum care.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Forms: 12 Month</strong></p>\n\n<p>Like the 6 month form, the 12 month form was used to gather  information on selected family demographic characteristics, child's  health, parenting practices, and health behaviors of the mother and  father. Questions included the frequency of injuries, emergency  department visits, and hospitalization in the past 12 months, use of  safety devices, activities that promote\nlearning and development,  sources of information on speech development, child care arrangements,  smoking practices, and mother's receipt of postpartum care.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Medical Record Abstraction: Vaccinations</strong></p>\n\n<p>This file contains demographic and vaccination data, including gender,  race/ethnicity, and insurance provider.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Medical Record Abstraction: Medical Visits</strong></p>\n\n<p>This file contains data abstracted from forms completed for every  visit recorded in the medical record or other primary care files,  including type visit and whether a physical assessment was conducted.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Medical Record Abstraction: Referrals/Consultations</strong></p>\n\n<p>These data are limited to information on any referrals or consultations  noted in the child's medical record or other primary care files,  including type of and reason for the referral.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Medical Record Abstraction: Hospitalizations/ED Visits</strong></p>\n\n<p>These data are limited to information on any hospitalization, emergency  department visit, or urgent care visit recorded in the child's medical  record or other primary care files, including the type of and reason  for the visit.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Healthy Steps Specialist Contact Logs</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data contained in this file represent every interaction between Healthy  Steps Specialists and the family, including home visits, office visits,  telephone calls to or from the family, parent groups, mailings, and  other types of contacts, such as hospital visits. Information collected on  each contact included the date of contact, type of contact, person  contacted, status of the contact, reason for the contact, whether  a handout was given out or a referral made during the contact, the issues/  problems discussed during the contact, and any action taken by the  Healthy Steps Specialist.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Interviews: 2-4 Month</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 2-4 month interview included questions about the respondent's  knowledge of child development, his/her sense of competence about  childrearing, his/her perception of support for childrearing  activities from both formal and informal sources, and his/her  engagement in activities with the child that promote health, learning,  and development. The interview also gathered information on the socio-  demographic characteristics of the family, including the mother's and  father's education, marital status, employment, income, and household  composition.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Parent Interviews: 30-33 Month</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 30-33 month interview is the source of data on parent and child   outcomes and assessed the extent to which families received the Healthy  Steps intervention. Specifically, parents were asked about utilization  of health-related services and about the child's health and progress  in reaching age-appropriate developmental milestones, concerns the parent  had about the child's development or behavior, and whether the child was  referred to services for a behavior or developmentally-related problem.  Additional questions addressed parenting activities that promote   development, family routines, engagement in safety activities, the  mother's general health status, use of substances, use of mental health  services, and use of the child's doctor or her obstetrician/gynecologist  as a source for discussing problems with depression and use of   preventive health care.</p></li>\n</ul>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child rearing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"infants"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parent child relationship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parenting skills"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CCEERC I.
