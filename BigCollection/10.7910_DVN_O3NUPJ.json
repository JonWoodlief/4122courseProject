The internal structure is one of the important evidence to demonstrate examination validity sources. Thus, aim of the study is to examine the internal structure of Korean nursing examinations and investigate performances of DETECT program. A real data study was conducted using data collected from Koran nursing licensing examinations taken by January 2014. It contains eight different subjects including the different item numbers. Each subject possesses its unique items that candidates require to learn as content objectives. Table 1 shows domain specification including the number of items. The number of examinees of real data was 16,085 and its number of items was 330.
