Information obtained through this survey was used for research purposes in a study sponsored by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to learn about the effects of capacity building services supported through the CCF program. Approximately 15 months after participant organizations applied for financial or technical assistance, they were asked to complete an additional questionnaire to provide current and up-to-date information about the operations of the organization, and any changes associated with the received assistance. The study sample was the entire population of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) that applied for assistance and were determined eligible by the 10 intermediary organizations awarded CCF Demonstration Program grants in the 2006 grant cycle. In total, 1,221 organizations completed the survey.  Survey questions were categorized into topics including organization profile, financial management practices, previous funding sources, record keeping, organizational governance, technological equipment, and level of community engagement.  Questions included the purpose for which the organization was applying for assistance, whether the organization was religious or faith-based, the organizations primary service areas, how the organization measures effectiveness and conducts self-evaluations, human resource practices, total expenditures for the year, whether the organization previously applied for funding, sources of revenue, whether the organization participated in grant writing workshops, methods used to spread awareness of the organization to various groups, the purpose of partnerships with other groups and how the organization used the Internet.  Other questions included a head count of paid and volunteer staff, the number of organizational leaders, the level of involvement of organizational leaders in staff development, the level of staff participation in training and development opportunities, the activities of the Board of Directors, whether there was sufficient technological equipment to meet organizational needs, focus areas and goals of the organization, and questions measuring change, development and helpfulness of the received assistance in the above mentioned areas."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"business
