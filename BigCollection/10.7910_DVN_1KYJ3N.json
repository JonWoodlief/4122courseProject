We propose a theoretical framework of five dimensions of executive appointment and dismissal that can be applied in both more democratic and more authoritarian regimes: the hereditary, military, ruling party, direct election and confidence dimensions, respectively. Relying on the Varieties of Democracy data, we provide measures of these five dimensions for 3,937 individual heads of state and 2,874 heads of government from 192 countries across the globe from 1789 to the present. After presenting descriptive evidence of their prevalence, variation and relationship to extant regime typologies, a set of exploratory probes gauge the extent to which the five dimensions can predict levels of repression, corruption, and executive survival, controlling for aspects of democracy. This leads to generation of a set of original hypotheses that we hope can serve as building blocks for explanatory theory. We conclude by discussing some limitations of these novel data."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-05-15"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"executive, regime, democracy, dictatorship"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Teorell, Jan"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-05-15"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This read-me file explains how to replicate the results","label":"read.me.rtf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136935,"dataFile":{"id":3154032,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"read.me.rtf","contentType":"application/rtf","filesize":1401,"description":"This read-me file explains how to replicate the results","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16363a2f138-f79cdf83b854","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"14f3b4cb26437e678b66e989335bad42","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"14f3b4cb26437e678b66e989335bad42"}}},{"description":"This is the Stata replication do-file.","label":"replication do-file.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136935,"dataFile":{"id":3154030,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"replication do-file.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":16816,"description":"This is the Stata replication do-file.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16363a2e1ad-025b6a4e8c82","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"bad017983a8b9a5f8c48e7fc2db21728","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"bad017983a8b9a5f8c48e7fc2db21728"}}},{"description":"This Stata dataset, based on a within-team version of the V-Dem dataset v 7.1 also including historical V-Dem, is needed to reproduce Figures 1-7, and the Appendix Graphs + Table H1.","label":"replication of descriptives data.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136935,"dataFile":{"id":3154033,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"replication of descriptives data.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":11567053,"description":"This Stata dataset, based on a within-team version of the V-Dem dataset v 7.1 also including historical V-Dem, is needed to reproduce Figures 1-7, and the Appendix Graphs + Table H1.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16363a2e7f4-3b191723d1bb","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d8f844de0c7d5fca3cde442cd524a683","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d8f844de0c7d5fca3cde442cd524a683"}}},{"description":"This Stata dataset, based on a within-team version of the V-Dem dataset v 7.1 also including historical V-Dem, is needed to reproduce Figure 8 + Appendix Table H2.","label":"replication of survival data.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136935,"dataFile":{"id":3154031,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"replication of survival data.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":12385770,"description":"This Stata dataset, based on a within-team version of the V-Dem dataset v 7.1 also including historical V-Dem, is needed to reproduce Figure 8 + Appendix Table H2.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16363a2ee76-a641832dbbc2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fabdf534f26eef23086a4823f40f163b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fabdf534f26eef23086a4823f40f163b"}}}]}}}
