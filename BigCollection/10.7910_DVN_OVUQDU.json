Controlling for scale,\r\ncomposition, technique as well as aggregate time effects, robust evidence is found that parliamentary green/leftlibertarian\r\nparty strength is associated with lower pollution levels. The rise of ecologically oriented parties has thus had\r\na real impact on air pollution levels. Traditional left-wing party strength is possibly also associated with lower pollution\r\nlevels, but the evidence is less consistent and robust. Combined left-wing party strength in government is possibly\r\nassociated with higher pollution levels, but this result is also far from robust and is practically small. No evidence is\r\nfound for a consistent systematic impact of corporatism on pollution levels."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-11"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for Ecological Economics (left-wing & corporatism).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79198,"dataFile":{"id":2775254,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OVUQDU/QOPOUY","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OVUQDU/QOPOUY","filename":"Article for Ecological Economics (left-wing & corporatism).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":3652,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15230538a65-6bb74239f273","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f772bcc5224159cb4a108c663101a275","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f772bcc5224159cb4a108c663101a275"}}},{"label":"Article for Ecological Economics (left-wing & corporatism).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79198,"dataFile":{"id":2775252,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OVUQDU/CVGZGD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OVUQDU/CVGZGD","filename":"Article for Ecological Economics (left-wing & corporatism).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":85623,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15230494f6c-7007fcbf2dd7","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:/q6R+0cjimByFGuwEOqIcQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2a61785713f2a1d57750195628fbc086","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2a61785713f2a1d57750195628fbc086"}}}]}}}
