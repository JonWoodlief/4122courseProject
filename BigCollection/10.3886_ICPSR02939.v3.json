Schools refusing participation  were replaced with similar schools in terms of geographic location,  size, and type of school (e.g., public, private/Catholic,  private/non-Catholic). The total sample was divided into six  subsamples consisting of an average of 2,700 respondents, and each  subsample was administered a different form of the questionnaire,  although all respondents answered the \"core\" drug and demographic  questions.
