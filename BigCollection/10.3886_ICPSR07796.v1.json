The sample was restricted to match the design of the  earlier study, so the merged file includes data for individual  Americans between 19 and 65 years of age living in cities with a  population between 30,000 and 280,000, and in households that had at  least one adult employed in a non-farming occupation. Two general  types of information were gathered in both studies: sociodemographic  background characteristics and time use data for a 24-hour period. The  1965-1966 time use data were obtained from a diary of activities kept  by the respondent over a 24-hour period, and the 1975-1976 data were  collected in face-to-face interviews. In both cases, the  sociodemographic data also were gathered from personal interviews. The  merged file contains sociodemographic background data that includes  age, sex, race, relationship to head of household, occupation, marital  status, number and age of children in household, homeowner/renter  status, residence tenure, number of paid household help, number of  books owned, church/religious preferences, highest level of education  attained, whether raised on a farm, and income level.
