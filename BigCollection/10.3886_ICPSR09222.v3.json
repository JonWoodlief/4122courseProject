County police, as distinguished from sheriffs' departments, were combined with municipal and township law enforcement agencies in the category of local police agencies. The remaining agencies were selected in a two-stage process. The first-stage units were counties, the same as those selected for the SURVEY OF INMATES OF LOCAL JAILS, 1983 [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 8274). For that survey, all counties in the United States were divided into five strata based on the average daily inmate population of the jails in the county. The first stratum included all counties containing jails with average daily populations of 100 inmates or more. These counties were included with certainty. The other four strata, with decreasing average jail populations, were sampled at varying intervals. A sixth stratum was added for the LEMAS survey to represent those states with combined jail/prison systems that were not included in the 1983 Survey of Local Jails. All counties in these states were included with certainty. All county-level law enforcement agencies in the counties selected for the sample were included in the survey. The second-stage units were municipal and township law enforcement agencies. A sample\nof these agencies was selected from within the six strata based on the number of sworn employees in the agency. In all, 3,054 law enforcement agencies were included in the sample. The final weight assigned to each case was the inverse of its probability of selection."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Performed consistency checks."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), 1987","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":36505,"dataFile":{"id":2620512,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), 1987","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
