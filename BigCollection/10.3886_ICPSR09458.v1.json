They were also asked if they would consider ending a pregnancy   if genetic tests showed any of a number of traits or problems in the   fetus. Additionally, respondents were asked if employers should have   the ri\nght to demand genetic testing before hiring, if insurance   companies would be justified in refusing to insure people whose   genetic tests indicated the likelihood of serious disease, and if   they would consider changing a child's inherited characteristics by   changing the child's genetic structure in the womb.
