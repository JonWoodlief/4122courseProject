It was for probation officers and a  significant other, where \"significant other\" was defined as a person  who had lived with the officer for more than one year. Officers and  their significant others were exposed to a series of interventions  related to various aspects of stress including: stress education,  organizational sources of stress, individual response to stress, and  how to communicate about stress in the home. The study participants  were recruited from the Harris County Community Supervision and  Corrections Department based in Houston, Texas. The program consisted  of four course modules and three assessments including: a pretest, a  post-test (administered one month after intervention), and a six-month  follow-up. The surveys were completed by 31 officers. At the beginning  of the first module, each probation officer and significant other was  given an envelope containing the pretest assessments: a Maslach  Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a knowledge of stress inventory. The  burnout inventory (Part 1) was a self-report measure containing three  sub-scales: emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5  items), and lack of personal accomplishment (8 items). The 22 items  that comprise the inventory are rated based on a 0-7 Guttman scale  consisting of: never, a few times a year or less, once a month or  less, a few times a month, once a week, a few times a week, or  everyday. Each item in the burnout inventory is a statement about the  individual's feelings or attitudes about their work. The knowledge of  stress inventory (Part 2) was a 25 item multiple-choice survey  intended to assess the participants' knowledge of stress. The  questions on the knowledge of stress inv\nentory were derived from the  curriculum for the present study and assessed all content areas of the  curriculum. The participants also completed an informed consent  document at the beginning of the first module. Both the post-test and  the follow-up assessments were sent to the officers through internal  department mail. All participants returned the completed assessments  to the principal investigator via the United States Postal Service.  Numerous efforts were made to ensure high subject response rates on  the assessments. All assessments were distributed with a cover letter  outlining the procedure for completing and returning the surveys.  After two weeks, the principal investigator made phone calls reminding  participants to complete and return the surveys. Further, the program  manager emailed reminders to the participants and contacted  participants' managers to have them verify that the officers had returned the surveys."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1, Burnout Inventory Data, includes  demographic variables such as gender, age, ethnicity, position within  the organization, and number of years experience with the department.
