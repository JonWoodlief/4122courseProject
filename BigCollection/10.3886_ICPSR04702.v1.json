This particular survey was concerned with the  attitudes and opinions of the citizens of South Africa. Respondents  gave their opinions of the performance of South Africa's President  Thabo Mbeki and elected officials in local and national government, the  government's handling of issues such as crime and the economy, the  most important issues facing the nation, and whether the country was  heading in the right direction. A series of questions addressed  respondents' living conditions, the economic conditions and political  influence of their own ethnic group compared to other groups in the  country, and whether they felt more attached to their national  identity or their ethnic group. Views were sought on the past,  present, and future of economic conditions in the country, economic  policies and reform, political parties, income inequality, civil  rights, equal rights for women, and whether laws were enforced  equally. Respondents rated their level of trust in the government,  military, courts, the media, and others, the level of corruption  existing in these groups, the ease of obtaining assistance with  securing documents and government services, the methods by which  respondents did so, and how often in the past year respondents had  paid a bribe to a government official. Other questions asked about  respondents' interest in public affairs, their level of civic  engagement, and their satisfaction with the way democracy and  elections worked in South Africa. Respondents were quizzed on their  knowledge of government officials, presidential term limits, and  government policy, and gave their interpretation of the concept of  democracy. Additional questions asked about media sources of  information, respondents' ownership of consumer goods such as books  and automobiles, their physical and mental health status, and whether  any close friends or relatives had died of AIDS. Information was also  collected on the presence of instit\nutions, public utilities, and  soliders in the area. Demographic variables include sex, age, race,  ethnicity, education level, language, employment status, occupation,  voter registration status and participation history, political party  affiliation, religious preference, religious participation, and type of residential area (e.g., urban, rural, etc.)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AIDS"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"bribery"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil

The purpose was to guarantee that larger  (i.e., more populated) geographical units have a proportionally  greater probability of being chosen into the sample. The sample was  drawn by taking the smallest geographic units, Census Enumeration  Areas (EAs), and stratifying all EAs across the country into separate  lists according to province, race, and urban/rural status. Six hundred  EAs were then randomly selected from these lists with the probability  proportionate to its size in the overall population as represented in  the 2001 Census. Four interviews were then randomly conducted within  each EA, and a respondent aged 18 years of age or older was randomly  selected from each household.
