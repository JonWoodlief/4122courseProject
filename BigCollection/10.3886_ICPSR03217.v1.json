The  study was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and opinions  about the 2000 election campaign for United States president.  Respondents were asked for their opinions of Republican candidate and  Texas governor George W. Bush and Democratic candidate and Vice  President Al Gore, prior to the second of three presidential debates  held October 11, 2001. Those polled answered a set of questions  comparing Bush and Gore as candidates in terms of their experience,  honesty, leadership qualities, ability to be an effective president,  and preparation for the job, as well as which candidate had attacked  the other unfairly during the campaign. Respondents were asked whether  they watched and/or listened to the October 3rd debate, who they  thought won the debate, and whether they planned to watch the debate  to be held on October 11. Respondents were also asked whom they  intended to vote for in the upcoming presidential election: Gore  (Democratic Party candidate), Bush (Republican Party candidate), Pat  Buchanan (Reform Party candidate), or Ralph Nader (Green Party  candidate).
