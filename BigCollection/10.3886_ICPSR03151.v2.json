The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) initiated surveys  of the public on their interactions with police in 1996 with the first  Police-Public Contact Survey, a pretest among a nationally  representative sample of 6,421 persons aged 12 or older. That initial  version of the questionnaire revealed that about 20 percent of the  public had direct, face-to-face contact with a police officer at least  once during the year preceding the survey. At that time, the principal  investigator estimated that about 1 in 500 residents, or about a half  million people, who had an encounter with a police officer also  experienced either a threat of force or the actual use of force by the  officer. The current survey, an improved version of the 1996  Police-Public Contact Survey, was fielded as a supplement to the  National Crime Victimization Survey (ICPSR 6406) during the last six  months of 1999. A national sample nearly 15 times as large as the  pretest sample in 1996 was used. The 1999 survey yielded nearly  identical estimates of the prevalence and nature of contacts between  the public and the police. This survey, because of its much larger  sample size, permits more extensive analysis of demographic  differences in police contacts than the 1996 pretest. In addition, it  added a new and more detailed set of questions about traffic stops by  police, the most frequent reason given for contact with police.  Variables in the dataset cover type of contact with police, including  whether it was face-to-face, initiated by the police or the citizen,  whether an injury to the officer or the citizen resulted from the  contact, crimes reported, and police use of force. Demographic  variables supplied for the citizens include gender, race, and Hispanic origin."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police citizen interactions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police community relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police use of force"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public interest"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
