Integrated crop management technologies are needed for enhancing rice productivity. A field experiment was conducted from 2006 to 2008 in a TypicHaplustult soil in southern Benin to identify the optimal seeding date of stylo relay-cropped into upland rice, and to evaluate the effects of fallow treatment and tillage management on rice yield, weed biomass and soil properties. Stylosanthesguianensis(stylo), a legume species, was used as a short-term fallow crop. Rice was grown once each year and stylo was seeded during the wet season and grown until the next rice-growing season. The effects of fallow treatment and tillage management (no-tillage vs. manual-tillage) on weed biomass during the rice-growing season were evaluated in 2007 and 2008, whereas the effects on rice yield were examined in 2007 alone. Results indicated that stylo can be established as a relay crop withupland rice about 10 days after rice seeding. Stylo fallow reduced weed biomass by 71% and 95% and increased total biomass (weed + stylo + litter) by 594% and 107% at the end of the dry seasons in 2007 and 2008, respectively. No-tillage without stylo fallow increased weed biomass by 62–202% over manual-tillage during the rice-growing seasons, whereas stylo fallow reduced weed biomass by 45–83% and 11–36%, respectively, under no-tillage and manual-tillage management. There were no significant effects of fallow treatment and tillagemanagement on soil organic C, total N, inorganic N and extractable P. Rice yields following stylofallowwere 0.7 Mg ha_1 higher than after the natural fallow. Manual-tillage increased rice yield by 0.6 Mg ha_1 over no-tillage. Manual-tillage combined with stylo fallow can be recommended to smallholder farmers for improving upland rice productivity."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Biomass"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Integrated crop management"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NERICA"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Relay-cropping"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"No-tillage"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-09-06"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Benin"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"West Africa"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Cotonou"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Combined effects of Stylosanthes guianensis fallow and tillage management saito et al Soil Tillage 2010.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43617,"dataFile":{"id":2420223,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Combined effects of Stylosanthes guianensis fallow and tillage management saito et al Soil Tillage 2010.xls","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":99840,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:91386","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"24043e0bd6263b10f9ff864d706ab90d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"24043e0bd6263b10f9ff864d706ab90d"}}}]}}}
