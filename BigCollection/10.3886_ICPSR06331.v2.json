Respondents were queried regarding President Bill Clinton's handling of crime and his vision of where he wants to lead the country. Opinions were also sought on the most important problem facing the country, the performance of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), federal spending on space exploration programs, and the respective roles of individuals and the federal government in helping solve the country's most important problems. Other topics addressed included crime, Michigan doctor Jack Kevorkian's assistance in the suicide of the terminally ill, and telephone ownership and usage. The poll also assessed the willingness of respondents to participate in a call-in survey during a live broadcast on CBS to react to an important national news event. Background information on respond\nents includes voter registration status, labor union membership, vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
