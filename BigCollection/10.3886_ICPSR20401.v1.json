One was a traditional office, focusing on holding offenders accountable and case processing. The other was a more community-oriented office, having implemented community prosecution. More specifically, the first office was more traditional in its approach to prosecution, focusing on holding offenders accountable and case processing with some additional efforts focused on addressing and preventing certain types of crime, such as gang and gun violence, domestic violence, child abuse, and truancy. The second office was more community-oriented, having implemented and embraced a community prosecution approach to crime, which involved proactive problem-solving, partnerships with the community, and use of techniques other than criminal prosecution to address certain types of crime and public safety issues.</p>\n\n<p>The American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI) conducted two site\nvisits to each site--one at the beginning of the project to select performance measures and a second in the middle of the project to review the performance measures data that had been submitted by the site. Performance measures were operationalized for each office according to the strategies and practices to which they were tied. Each site submitted monthly data on the identified performance measures for analysis. The data collected to construct each measure focused on available relevant data already in existence in each of the sites. Data elements used to create the measures included items such as the number of particular cases filed, pleas to lesser charges or as charged, or convicted, number of repeat offenders, sentence length, number of reported crimes and calls for service, and case processing times, among others. Both traditional and non-traditional data elements were selected for both sites. Site 1 submitted 15 months of data (Part 1) and Site 2 submitted 6 months of data (Part 2). APRI created models for each site showing the relationship between goals, objectives, performance measures, and activities. Correlation and factor analyses were used to examine the relationship between the measures and the goals/objectives.</p>\n\n<p>APRI also designed and administered a public safety survey to assess a number of factors related to the performance of prosecutors' offices, but for which data could not be provided by the offices. In Part 3, a total of 975 citizens were asked to provide some basic demographic data about themselves and to respond to Likert-style questions measuring attitudes and opinions on six factors: the seriousness of local crime, safety of the environment, organizational behavior of the prosecutor's office, participation in the community, community education, and task performance. The public safety surveys were administered by phone using random digit dialing (RDD). Dialing continued until 325 respondents, in each of the jurisdictions, provided complete survey data. In Site 1, the public safety survey was administered twice, in December 2005 and in April 2006. In Site 2, the public safety survey was administered in September 2006.
