Respondents were asked whether they intended to vote in the November  7, 2000, presidential election and for whom they would vote if the  election were held that day, given a choice between Vice President Al  Gore (Democrat), Texas governor George W. Bush (Republican),  conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (Reform), and consumer advocate  Ralph Nader (Green). Their views were sought on the importance of gun  control, protecting Social Security, and prescription drug benefits  for the elderly in making their decision for whom to vote and which  candidate could be trusted most in these areas. Respondents were asked  whether they supported or opposed having Medicare cover prescription  drugs for senior citizens, even if they had to pay more for  Medicare. A series of questions addressed Social Security, including  whether respondents believed Social Security would be there when they  retired and whether they supported or opposed a plan in which people  could choose to invest some of their Social Security contributions in  the stock market. Respondents were asked for their opinions of the  April 22, 2000, removal by federal agents of Elian Gonzalez, the  six-year-old Cuban boy whose mother drowned when they attempted to  immigrate to Florida, from the home of his Miami relatives and whether  the relatives or Elian's father should be granted custody of him. A  series of questions focused on gun control. Specific items addressed  respondent support for laws requiring background checks at gun shows,  trigger locks on stored guns, the registration of firearms, licenses  for handgun owners, and banning the sale of assault weapons and the  sale of handguns except to law enforcement. Additional questions  addressed whether respondents lived in fear of guns, spoke with their  children about guns, and had been threatened by a gun. Background  information on respondents includes age, gender, political party,  political orientation, voter registration, education, religion, labor  union membership, household gun ownership, Hispanic origin, household  income, children in household, and whether respondents regularly took prescription drugs."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Buchanan, Pat"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"campaign issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gore, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun control"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun legislation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun regulation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Nader, Ralph"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
