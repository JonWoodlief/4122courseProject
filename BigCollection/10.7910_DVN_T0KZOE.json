Participants were randomly selected from the Ethnic and Racial Minorities in Urban Areas Survey (ERMUAS) New York sample. The ERMUAS study was conducted as a companion study to the MacArthur Foundation Midus Survey on Successful Mid-Life Development to represent low income and ethnic and racial minority Americans in Chicago and New York. Participants ranged in age from twenty-five to seventy-four, the bulk between forty-one and sixty-eight years old. About two-thirds of the sample completed high school as their highest level of education and ten percent held bachelor's degrees.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n The sample consisted of one-hundred participants randomly selected from the New York sample. Participants were Dominican, Puerto Rican, and African American men and women from Harlem, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, New York City.

About two-thirds of the sample completed high school as their highest level of education and ten percent held bachelor's degrees.\r\n <br /><br />\r\nFocused life-history interviews were administered face-to-face for a period of approximately three hours, and were tape-recorded.

Participants also completed questionnaires assessing health, education, household information, neighborhood experience and services, employment history and status, network characteristics and basic demographics.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study.
