Findings from this study will be used to inform PSI/Swaziland's MC communication campaigns and service delivery strategies in order to ensure greatest impact. Specifically, the research objectives were to: To identify important behavioral drivers of and barriers to MC among males aged 13-29 years; and To obtain baseline information for key MC indicators, behavioral determinants (categorized either as opportunity, ability, or motivation OAM) and exposure to MC messages among males aged 13-29 years. A cross-sectional survey using structured individual interviews was conducted among men aged 13-29 years in 4 regions of Swaziland (Hhohho, Manzini, Shiselweni and Lubombo) which make up the project area for MC activities in the country. A two stage   sampling strategy was utilized to select eligible participants. The first stage involved selection of enumeration areas (EAs) from a list of all EAs in the country defined as per the 2007 Swaziland Population Census. The EAs were then stratified into rural and urban settlements. Sampling of EAs was dependent upon the size of the EA. A tot\nal of 184 EAs in the country were visited during the survey (68.6% of the EAs were in rural areas and 31.4% in urban areas). In Hhohho, Manzini, lubombo and Shiselweni regions 28.8%, 32.6%, 19.6% and 21.2% EAs were visited respectively. The second stage of sampling was a selection of households in sampled EAs using systematic random sampling. In a household only one eligible respondent was interviewed.   In cases where the number of eligible respondents in a household was more than one, a Kish grid was used to select one participant. A total of 1533 households were visited with the same number (1533) of interviews completed for this baseline study. Analyses consisted of calculating descriptive statistics for key program indicators, logistic regression and unianova to ascertain which determinants were correlated with key behaviours. Socio-demographic characteristics were controlled for in the analyses."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Quantitative"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"TRaC"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cross-sectional"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Men"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"VMC"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV/AIDS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"BCC"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gates foundation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CDC"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SWAZILAND (2010): MALE CIRCUMCISION TRAC STUDY EVALUATING THE USE OF MALE CIRCUMCISION AMONG MALES AGED 13-29 YEARS IN RURAL AND URBAN SWAZILAND 1st ROUND"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI/Swaziland"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://psi.org/resources/research"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Swaziland"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"2010-swaziland_trac_hiv_ml_mc.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":62023,"categories":["report on web"],"dataFile":{"id":2504096,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"2010-swaziland_trac_hiv_ml_mc.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":158945,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:243464","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"124ce69413d4546efda45dbec4deb388","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"124ce69413d4546efda45dbec4deb388"}}},{"description":"","label":"Swaziland 2010 MC TRaC Summary Report _FINAL.doc","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":62023,"categories":["report"],"dataFile":{"id":2419120,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Swaziland 2010 MC TRaC Summary Report _FINAL.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":1031168,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:90465","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e5e208ef3ab6f823d63ab2104bbba649","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e5e208ef3ab6f823d63ab2104bbba649"}}}]}}}
