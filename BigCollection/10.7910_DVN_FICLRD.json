Such projects regularly cause Not In My Back Yard, or NIMBY, responses from local residents around the world.\n<br /><br /> The dataset contains observations on approximately 500 Japanese cities, towns, and villages covering the period from 1955 through 1995. Data was collected through archival research, interviews with anti-facility activists and officials, and surveys of relevant government offices throughout Japan.<br /><br /> Variables assessed include the number of siting attempts and successes in the locality, the town’s location in Japan by prefecture and by political district code alongside batte\nries of information on demographic, socioeconomic, and political factors. Demographic information includes sex ratios in the locality over time along with percentage of elderly in the population. Socioeconomic status was examined through measures of primary, secondary, and tertiary sector workforces over time along with variables on the coastal, mid-range, and deep sea fishing cooperatives (where applicable). Political variables include district magnitude, presence or absence of a prime minister from locally elected representatives, number of long-term Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) representatives, and the number of members of the town council and their political party. Additional political variables include the numbers and percentage of representatives from all major political parties in the national legislature, political party of the mayor, and measures of over-time support from the area for the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party. The dataset contains publicly-available information on compensation provided to communities along with information on eminent domain use."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NIMBY"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"facility siting"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nuclear power"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"dam"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"airport"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"japan"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"controversial facility"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil society"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Aldrich, Daniel P.
