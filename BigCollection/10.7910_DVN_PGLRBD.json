Census units are small territorial units established during the national population census, which was conducted in the year 2000 by the National Statistics Office.  In the LQAS method of sampling, only one outlet selling the product needs to be present in a census unit or hot zone for the area to be considered as covered. The 19 CUs were randomly selected from provinces in each of the four regions of PNG. Central and the National Capital District, Morobe, Western Highlands, and the East New Britain Provinces. In this study, the four provinces selected for the study are referred to as supervision areas. The LQAS assessment of coverage determines the proportion of outlets in supervision areas in which health products such as condoms, lubricants, mosquito nets, etc. are available. In addition to providing a basic measure of product coverage, the LQAS assessment also determines quality of coverage, that is the proportion of outlets in each administrative area in which the products conform to additional minimum standards. The quality standards were measured using the following indicat\nors: (1) Product is clearly visible, (2) There were no stock-outs during the 4 weeks prior to the study, (3) HIV and AIDS or condom promotional items are visibly displayed in the outlet, and (4) in hot zones, condoms are available in outlets that stay open late (closing at or after 10pm). At least three of the indicators had to be met in order to meet the minimum standard of the quality of coverage.  All outlets in the selected CUs were audited, and additional information was collected on the frequency of stock outs, and willingness to stock and sell the products for outlets which never stocked the product. High-risk geographic areas for HIV transmission (referred to as Âhot zones in this report) are defined by clustering hotspots with contiguous catchments. Hotspots include bars, roadside markets, guest houses, hotels, and lodges. Data was collected in March, 2008. The outlet audits were conducted with electronic survey forms on PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), and the coordinates of each venue were recorded with GPS (Global Positioning System) units, since these are required to analyze access and to visually represent outlets on maps."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MAP"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LQAS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Providers"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV/AIDS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Malaria"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Diarrhea"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"BCC"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Condoms"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LLIN"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ORS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Asian development bank, AusAID"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Papua New Guinea (2008): MAP Study Evaluating the Availability of Condoms and Other Health Products in Morobe, NCD and Central, Western Highlands and East New Britian Provinces.
