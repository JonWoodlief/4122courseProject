For this, we link administrative records on secondary school entry tests with targeted survey data. In a companion paper (Boes, Hangartner and Schmid 2017), we investigate the e\u000bect of sorting pupils into upper and lower level tracks on secondary and tertiary degrees and \fnd statistically signi\fcant and substantively relevant tracking e\u000bects in non-permeable school systems. Following Boes, Hangartner and Schmid (2017), we focus on the graduates of non permeable schools to identify the impact of sorting in higher (versus lower) level tracks as a teenager on political attitudes and behaviors as an adult. In particular, we will focus on the following political outcomes: Impact of Immigration, Increase Immigration, Institutional Trust, Issue-Based Ideology, Left-Right Self Placement, Participation, Political Interest, Political Knowledge, Reported Ideology, Vote Choice."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-09-19"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hangartner, Dominik"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-09-19"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Preregistered Analysis Plan","label":"PAP.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":128824,"dataFile":{"id":3052681,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/UNCROQ/UKNMGE","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UNCROQ/UKNMGE","filename":"PAP.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":205771,"description":"Preregistered Analysis Plan","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15e9c2583a4-2597d3c5a140","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b7e88b64371bb04c66970abceaa11511","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b7e88b64371bb04c66970abceaa11511"}}}]}}}
