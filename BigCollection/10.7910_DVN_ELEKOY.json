rand has done it for you.<br /> <br /> the health and retirement study only includes noninstitutionalized adults when new respondents get added to the panel (as they were in <a href=\"http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=howsite&amp;jumpfrom=HG\">1992, 1993, 1998, 2004, and 2010</a>) but once they're in, they're in - respondents have a weight of\nzero for interview waves when they were nursing home residents; but they're still responding and will continue to contribute to your statistics so long as you're generalizing about a population from a previous wave (for example: it's possible to compute \"among all americans who were 50+ years old in 1998, x% lived in nursing homes by 2010\").  my source for that 411?\n<a href=\"http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/sitedocs/surveydesign.pdf\">page 13 of the design doc</a>.  wicked.  this new github repository contains five scripts:<br /> <br /> <br /> <b>1992 -
