Greater ethnic diversity and growing calls for multiculturalism represent a disproportionately greater challenge to rightists because they value conformity, tradition and stability more than leftists. Consequently, we hypothesize that the impact of political ideology on opposition to immigration has become stronger over time. Analyses show that: a) leftists were less opposed to immigration than rightists in both 2002 and 2014, and b) rightists have become more opposed to immigration in the time between 2002 and 2014, whereas leftistsâ€™ reactions remained stable across this period. We tested our motivated reasoning hypothesis in a repeated cross-sectional (fixed effects regression) analysis of individual-level data from 18 countries (N = 55,367). The individual-level data on political ideology and immigration policy preferences is from the European Social Survey data sets fielded in 2002 and 2014."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-11-04"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political ideology, opposition to immigration, motivated reasoning, repeated cross-sectional analysis"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Rafiqi, Arzoo"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-11-04"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Dataset_Replication_ Thomsen & Rafiqi.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":146197,"dataFile":{"id":3302304,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/N1BGHI/LIWB3E","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/N1BGHI/LIWB3E","filename":"Dataset_Replication_ Thomsen & Rafiqi.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata-14","filesize":87217912,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166df038a7c-70d0f3ec717a","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1ac80dac24ccc0e124729aead835ecca","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1ac80dac24ccc0e124729aead835ecca"}}},{"label":"Do file _ Replication _Thomsen & Rafiqi.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":146197,"dataFile":{"id":3302305,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/N1BGHI/AOZU1K","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/N1BGHI/AOZU1K","filename":"Do file _ Replication _Thomsen & Rafiqi.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":6732,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166df038d7f-d224dfe5155c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1af028fc5e2899ac777ec90671eabd57","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1af028fc5e2899ac777ec90671eabd57"}}}]}}}
