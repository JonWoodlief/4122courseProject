Finalized surveys were mailed in July 2006 to 950 law enforcement agencies, and a total of 518 law enforcement agencies provided information on less lethal force generally and on their deployment and policies regarding conducted energy devices (CEDs) in particular. A total of 292 variables are included in the National Use of Force Survey Data (Part 1) including items about weapons deployment, force policies, training, force reporting/review, force incidents and outcomes, and conducted energy devices (CEDs). Researchers also collected agency-supplied use of force data from law enforcement agencies in Richland County, South Carolina; Miami-Dade, Florida; and Seattle, Washington; to identify individual and situational predictors of injuries to officers and citizens during use of force events. The Richland County, South Carolina Data (Part 2) include 441 use-of-force reports from January 2005 through July 2006. Part 2 contains 17 variables including whether the officer or suspect was injured, 8 measures of officer force, 3 measures of suspect resistance, the number of witnesses and officers present at each incident, and the number of suspects that resisted or assaulted officers for each incident. The Miami-Dade County, Florida Data (Part 3) consist of 762 use-of-force incidents that occurred between January 2002 and May 2006. Part 3 contains 15 variables, including 4 measures of officer force, the most serious resistance on the part of the suspect, whether the officer or suspect was injured, whether the suspect was impaired by drugs or alcohol, the officer's length of service in years, and several demographic variables pertaining to the suspect and officer. The Seattle, Washington Data (Part 4) consist of 676 use-of-force incidents that occurred between December 1, 2005, as 15 variables, including 3 measures of officer force, whether the suspect or officer was injured, whether the suspect was impaired by drugs or alcohol, whether the suspect used, or threatened to use, physical force against the officer(s), and several demographic variables relating to the suspect and officer(s).

The participants at the first focus group generated a list of issues pertaining to weapons deployment, policies, use-of-force continuums/models, training, reporting, and review. At the second focus group, the participants were asked to comment and provide feedback on the draft survey. The final focus group, comprised of law enforcement agency personnel, focused on a general discussion concerning who should fill out the survey within the target agencies and the participants' general impressions of the survey. Following the third focus group, the finalized surveys were mailed in July 2006 to 950 law enforcement agencies. A follow-up mailing was sent to nonrespondents three weeks later. Finally, a series of reminder letters was sent to the agencies that had not responded to any of the previous mailings. The first reminder was sent in September 2006; there were two subsequent reminders that were sent to nonrespondents approximately three and six weeks later.

The TSS stratified the agencies by type of law enforcement agency, region, and the size of the population served. Law enforcement agencies were categorized as State Police, Police Departments, or Sheriff Offices. United States Census categories were used to designate four regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The research team also developed seven categories of agencies denoting populations served: Under 10,000 people, 10,000 to 49,999 people, 50,000 to 99,999 people, 100,000 to 499,999 people, 500,000 to 749,999 people, 750,000 to 999,999 people, and 1,000,000 or more people. The objective was to select 1,000 agencies from the stratified target population to receive surveys. All 50 state police agencies were included, as were all 141 law enforcement agencies serving a population of 500,000 or more. All 6 Sheriff Offices in the Northeast region serving populations of less than 10,000 were also included with certainty. The remaining 803 law enforcement agencies were selected from the law enforcement agencies within the 35 other stratified groups, yielding a total of 1,000 law enforcement agencies. However, prior to survey distribution, the research team determined that 50 of those agencies were either duplicates of others in the sample, were no longer in existence, and/or were not of the appropriate agency type to participate in this survey. These were removed from the sample, yielding a final sample size of 950 law enforcement agencies, of which 518 responded to the survey.</p>\n\n<p>The research team also utilized its contacts to obtain use of force data from the Richland County, South Carolina Sheriff's Department (Part 2), the Miami-Dade County, Florida Police Department (Part 3), and the Seattle, Washington Police Department (Part 4). Thus, these agencies represented a convenience sample.</p>\n\n<p>To create the sample for the Multiagency Use of Force Data (Part 5), the researchers used the data generated from the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) National Use of Force Survey to identify responding agencies that indicated that they captured injury information on officers and citizens and that they maintained use of force data in an electronic format. Only agencies that had at least 100 sworn officers and that reported issuing conducted energy devices (CEDs) to their officers were included in the selection process. After applying the selection criteria, 26 agencies were identified as possibly having data that met the requirements for the analysis.</p>\n\n<p>The research team contacted the 26 agencies by telephone to further assess the compatibility of their data and to request their participation in the study. However, many of the 26 agencies did not actually have use of force and injury data available in an electronic format that could be accessed and converted into a data file for analysis. In other cases, the agencies’ records management systems were not set up to easily retrieve the data. In addition, some agencies did not maintain the data that was needed in a database; rather, they captured and stored images of paper-based use of force forms (as PDFs or similar) that had to be downloaded and coded by hand. Still other agencies had major flaws in the way that they captured and stored information, which rendered their da\nta unusable.</p>\n\n<p>As the original list of 26 eligible agencies dwindled, the research team sought participation from other agencies with which it had contacts (and which were not survey respondents) and sought the assistance of PERF in identifying additional agencies whose data may have been suitable for analysis. This process resulted in the identification and participation of two additional agencies, but it also resulted in ruling out another handful of agencies which did not have suitable data. Finally, as the research team began constructing the master dataset for the multiagency analysis, the team decided to include the data that it already had from the Miami-Dade County Police Department, the Richland County Sheriff's Department, and the Seattle Police Department. The final sample for Part 5 includes 12 law enforcement agencies. In addition to the Richaland County, Miami-Dade County, and the Seattle Police Departments, data were collected from the Austin, Texas Police Department, the Cincinnati, Ohio Police Department, the Harris County, Texas Sheriff's Department, the Los Angeles, California Police Department, the Los Angeles County, California Sheriff's Department, the Nashville, Tennessee Police Department, the Orlando, Florida Police Department, and the San Antonio, Texas Police Department.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, after reviewing the data available for the multiagency analysis, the research team selected the law enforcement agencies in Orlando, Florida (Part 6) and Austin, Texas (Part 7) for its longitudinal data sample.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record abstracts"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For Part 1, a weighting process was required so that the research team could provide a composite picture of law  enforcement practices nationwide.
