Respondents were asked to comment on what   they thought was the most important problem facing the country, and to   give their approval rating of George Bush with respect to his handling   of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy. Questions were also   posed regarding respondents' vote intentions for the 1992 presidential   election, their opinions of potential 1992 presidential candidates, the   likelihood of their voting in either a Republican or Democratic   presidential primary or caucus, their candidate preferences for the   Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, and issues   presidential candidates should emphasize. Respondents were asked about   the amount of attention they had paid to the 1992 presidential   campaign, policy development in the Bush Administration, how well the   political system worked, and the necessity of politica\nl parties.   Questions about Bush focused on how he handled the environment and   relations with Russia, and his progress in improving education and   reducing poverty. Additional questions about Bush dealt with whether he   had kept his campaign promises, how he had dealt with illegal drugs,   and how much improvement there had been in the country since his   election in 1988. Respondents were asked how they felt about a woman's   serving in a higher government position, abortion, the situation in   Iraq, medical care, United States military intervention in trouble   spots, family values, Social Security, balancing the budget, improving   education, labor unions, and tax increases. Those surveyed were also   asked about Ross Perot and his effect on the two-party system, aid to   the former Soviet Union, the responsibility of the government to   provide jobs, and the restriction of foreign imports. Additional   questions pertained to the qualities of leadership demonstrated by   Bush, Bill Clinton, and Perot, their stands on the issues, respondents'   sources of news on the presidential candidates, whether they had ever   watched call-in programs on television, and whether there was a   connection between what a candidate says before an election and what he   does after being elected. The poll also posed a series of questions   about Elvis Presley and his fans. Background information on respondents   includes sex, age, race, marital status, education, religious   preference, employment status, family income, political orientation,  and party preference."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
