In spite of Singapore’s recognized success in deploying information communication technologies for economic progress, the liberalizing effects of the Internet have been limited. Using a descriptive social network analysis approach, we explore the dynamics that are taking place online and argue for their implications on the evolving political discourse. The study reveals that political bloggers and political parties dominate the cyberspace, while issue-based advocacy groups and media agencies are relegated to less important positions. In addition, high levels of interactivity are observed among political bloggers. These findings are of significant relevance to countries where media systems are stringently regulated by the government as they point to the existence of possible networking structures which may exist in the online world. There lies a potential for the creation of an alternative and viable sphere of discourse for individuals and marginalized groups to circumvent offline media regulations and disseminate their perspectives online."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-07-26"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Flows of relations and communication among Singapore political bloggers and organizations: The networked public sphere approach"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-08-21"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-06"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-07"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-06"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-07"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Hyperlinks"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Singapore"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Singapore political bloggers, civil society organizations, political organizations, discussion forums and news media"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Sample List","label":"Singapore sites_Sample List (Carol Soon).xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":46080,"dataFile":{"id":1579551,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Singapore sites_Sample List (Carol Soon).xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":357888,"description":"Sample List","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:61339","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d7657de8de818a8b53edfcc7ab8aa808","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d7657de8de818a8b53edfcc7ab8aa808"}}},{"description":"Training Memo","label":"Singapore sites_training memo(Carol Soon).doc","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":46080,"dataFile":{"id":1579552,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Singapore sites_training memo(Carol Soon).doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":47616,"description":"Training Memo","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:61340","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1893efcc4e86ac47535589ea2a0edd4b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1893efcc4e86ac47535589ea2a0edd4b"}}}]}}}
