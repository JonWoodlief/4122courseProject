The researchers divided the final sample of 156,702 offenders into a treatment group, which was composed of all releasees who had their DNA entered in a database at some point prior to their release from prison, and a control group, which was composed of all releasees who did not have their DNA entered in a database until being rearrested after release or as of the end of a three-year follow-up period. This allowed for the analysis of two effects. First, the FDLE criminal history records were used to define rearrest within three years of release as an outcome, to see if DNA sampling resulted in a deterrent effect.
