Ultimately, this report aims to develop appropriate recommendations so that PSI/Laos can tailor its BCC strategy promoting the consistent and correct use of condoms/lubricant among katoey with every sexual partner, including both casual and regular partners. Eight transgender key informants recruited katoey participants from several sites including beauty salons, karaoke, discotheques, beer shops and schools in five districts of Vientiane. The recruiters distributed contact cards, collected telephone numbers and set up appointments by phone.   There were forty-two self-identified, eligible katoey selected to be participants. Participants were divided into six groups for the FGD, with eight katoey in each group. Three of the groups were comprised of people ranging in age from 15 to 20 years old, and participants in the other three groups were slightly older, ranging in age from 21 to 30 years old.  To minimize bias from existing relationships, effort was taken to separate participants in order to minimize the number of friends and acquaintances that were placed in the same group.    All six FGDs were conducted at the Ministry of Education's guesthouse. This guesthouse has been used to conduct indoor tra\ninings for MSM several times and provides a friendly and confidential environment appropriate for FGDs.   Two male-to-female katoey, including a moderator and a note-taker, were trained one week before the FGDs were conducted. After receiving the training, they worked together to pretest the moderator guide.  The pretest familiarized the moderator with the protocol, and helped clarify vocabulary and inquiries on how the questions and prompts would help us collect information on the objectives of this qualitative research.  All katoey participants agreed to be audio taped during the FGD and discussions typically lasted between one and one and a half hours. The note-takers transcribed the discussion from the audio tapes and reviewed the transcripts so that the comments recorded were correct.  Incentives provided to all participants included a transportation reimbursement of 20,000 kip (approximately $2), snacks and soft drinks."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Qualitative"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Focus group"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV/AIDS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Transgender"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Condom Use"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Condoms"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"BCC"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"USAID"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DFID"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI/Laos"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005-03-29"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005-03-29"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005-03-21"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Lao People's Democratic Republic"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"FGDs guide-Eng-final.doc","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68322,"categories":["discussion guide"],"dataFile":{"id":2339447,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"FGDs guide-Eng-final.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":40448,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:79510","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6a9b5676701f1f69a8027a35d8a48743","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6a9b5676701f1f69a8027a35d8a48743"}}},{"description":"","label":"MSM_FGD_draft_report_10Aug06.doc","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68322,"categories":["report"],"dataFile":{"id":2339446,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"MSM_FGD_draft_report_10Aug06.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":145920,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:79511","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"780bb602e7bfd9e91c73a7b8478ce4e4","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"780bb602e7bfd9e91c73a7b8478ce4e4"}}},{"description":"","label":"Study Design.doc","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68322,"categories":["study design"],"dataFile":{"id":2339449,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Study Design.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":73216,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:79509","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"c8a28c0fa746c0c979f0221d5537077f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"c8a28c0fa746c0c979f0221d5537077f"}}}]}}}
