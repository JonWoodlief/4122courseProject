Sperm parameters were assessed using the World Health Organization guidelines. SDF testing was performed using the Halosperm kit. Sperm parameters and sperm DFI results were compared.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe overall sperm parameter results and sperm DFI showed normal values; however, the morphology value was at the lower limit of normal. High sperm DFI was associated with significantly lower motility and viability (p<0.001, respectively). Sperm motility and morphology were significantly higher in the higher sperm count group compared to the lower sperm count group (p<0.05), while sperm DFI was higher in the lower sperm count group (p<0.05). Sperm count and viability and sperm DFI were significantly associated with the quality of sperm motility (p<0.001). Sperm motility and sperm DFI were significantly different (p<0.001) between normal and abnormal sperm viability groups. Between normal and abnormal sperm morphology groups, sperm count, motility, and sperm DFI showed significant differences (p<0.001).\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nIn this study, a correlation between SDF and sperm parameters was confirmed in men with varicocele. SDF may be contributing factors to sperm motility, viability, and morphology. Abnormal sperm count, motility, and viability showed high sperm DFI. Therefore, lower sperm parameters were indicative of increasing SDF in men with varicocele.\r\n\r\nKeywords: DNA fragmentation; Infertility; Semen analysis; Sperm; Spermatogenesis; Varicocele"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-01"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://doi.org/10.5534/wjmh.180014 "},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://doi.org/10.5534/wjmh.180014 "}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Park, Hyun Jun"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-06"}]}},"files":[{"label":"SDF data정리-WJMH.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":140999,"dataFile":{"id":3213845,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/2LEMBG/0YEB1E","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/2LEMBG/0YEB1E","filename":"SDF data정리-WJMH.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":135731,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165ad374b17-95eab5b2c371","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"c202bdcfaa02ef7973f942cd254003bf","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"c202bdcfaa02ef7973f942cd254003bf"}}}]}}}
