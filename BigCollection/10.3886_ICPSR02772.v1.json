Those queried were asked to assess  whether most of the people they encountered possessed good or bad  manners, how most people's manners compared to two and three decades  ago, and whether it was better for people to have good manners, yet  hide what they really think. Respondents were asked whether the  following were minor or major sources of bad manners in this country:  stress, parental failure to instill good manners, educational  institutions' failure to teach good manners, and television/movie  influences. Those queried were asked whether enforcing good\nmanners or  allowing people freedom of expression was a greater societal good.  Respondents were asked which of the following activities they had  engaged in over the last few months: holding a door open for a  stranger, using a swear word in public, speaking rudely to someone in  public, and making an obscene gesture at another person while driving  a car. Additional questions covered the content of children's  television programs, and whether saying \"please\" and \"thank you\"  would make the world a better place. Background information on  respondents includes age, race, sex, education, age of people in household, and income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"media influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social interaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social values"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
