Respondents were asked whether they felt their country  was going in the right direction in general, how well their country's  economy and their own finances had fared over the past year, whether  they thought the establishment of a free market economy was right or  wrong, and whether economic reforms and privatization were occurring  too fast or too slowly. Satisfaction with the development of democracy  and with their own place in their political system was assessed, as  was intention to vote in the next general election. A series of  questions elicited opinions on the respect for human rights in one's  own country and on the situation for minority rights. Several items  concerned respondents' trust in various forms of information media,  including broadcasts from the West. Respondents were asked how  frequently they thought of themselves as European. They were also  asked to indicate how aware they were of, and how interested in, the  European Community and its activities and institutions, and to rate  how positively they regarded the European Community and the prospect  of their country's membership in the Community. Country-specific  questions were asked regarding sources of information about the  European Community. Participants were also asked about how the  economy, government, and private citizens might be advantaged or  disadvantaged by the country's increasing ties with the European  Community. The survey explored the prospect of future alignments with  the United States, the European Community, other East European  countries, other (non-EC) European countries, Russia, Turkey, Japan,  and South Korea. Opinions were sought on the fairness of European  Community and other countries' trade and assistance policies. In  additio\nn, respondents' views were obtained on the break-up of European  nations, their personal likelihood of emigration to other European  countries, and the effectiveness of the United Nations and other  international organizations' intervention in the former Yugoslavia. A  few of these questions were asked of a small sample of persons in  Serbia and Croatia. Demographic data collected on each participant  include age, education, occupation, religion, ethnic background,  mother tongue, citizenship, union membership, left/right political placement, sex, and income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"democracy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Economic Community"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"human rights"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international alliances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political awareness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"privatization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
