The validity of the nursing skills to be included in the test was evaluated on a 4.0 scale: 1, not valid at all; 2, not valid; 3, valid; 4, very valid. \r\nThe questionnaire survey targeted nursing college professors, clinical nurses, and experts in nursing education policy. Among the institutions of nursing education and nursing policy (200 nursing colleges, 20 general hospitals with 300+ wards, and KABONE), the survey selected its respondents by convenience sampling based on the regional distribution of nursing colleges and general hospitals. Roughly 250 copies of the questionnaire were distributed, 202 were collected, and 200 were analyzed, since 2 of them were deemed not to contain sincere responses.
