Robbery victims were identified  by canvassing convenience stores in high-crime areas, while a sample  of unrelated offenders was obtained from state prison rolls. The aims  of the survey were to address questions of injury, to examine store  characteristics that might influence the rate of robbery and injury,  to compare how both victims and offenders perceived the robbery event  (including their assessment of what could be done to prevent  convenience store robberies in the future), and to identify ways in  which the number of convenience store robberies might be reduced.  Variables unique to Part 1, the Victim Data file, provide information  on how the victim was injured, whether hospitalization was required  for the injury, if the victim used any type of self-protection, and  whether the victim had been trained to handle a robbery. Part 2, the  Offender Data file, presents variables describing offenders' history of  prior convenience store robberies, whether there had been an  accomplice, motive for robbing the store, and whether various factors  mattered in choosing the store to rob (e.g., cashier location, exit  locations, lighting conditions, parking lot size, the number of clerks  working, weather conditions, the time of day, and the number of  customers in the store). Found in both files are variables detailing  whether a victim injury occurred, use of a weapon, how each  participant behaved, perceptions of why the store was targeted, what  could have been done to prevent the robbery, and ratings by the  researchers on the completeness, honesty, and cooperativeness of each  participant during the interview. Demographic variables found in both  the victim and offender files include age, gender, race, and ethnicity."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Homicide ranks as one of the leading types of  occupational injuries in the United States, accounting for a large  number of deaths. Convenience stores have the second highest  prevalence of workplace homicide, second only to taxicabs. This has  prompted leaders of the convenience store industry, public health  officials, and criminal justice practitioners to search for ways in  which these rates could be reduced and the safety of workers in  convenience stores enhanced. A variety of reasons make convenience  stores prone to robbery. These stores are easily accessible and are  located in metropolitan areas. They have available cash on hand, which  makes them attractive to robbers who need a quick source of funds. It  was thought, however, since convenience stores are static  establishments, that certain crime control strategies employed by police,  by the stores, or through public ordinances might have a deterrent  effect on robbery. The objective of this study was to advance research  in the area of convenience store robberies by (1) addressing questions  of injury, (2) examining store characteristics that might influence  the rate of robbery and injury, (3) comparing how robbery victims and  offenders perceived the robbery event, particularly their assessment  of what\ncould be done to prevent convenience store robberies in the  future, and (4) identifying ways in which the number of convenience store robberies might be reduced."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, and  South Carolina were selected for the study because these states had  previously conducted research to estimate the probability of  convenience store robberies in their jurisdictions and the extent of  injury in those robberies. For the victim file, 20 interviews were  conducted in four of the five states participating in the study. In  the fifth state (Michigan), primarily for logistical reasons of  distance and difficulty in gaining access to convenience stores,  victim interviews were not completed. This resulted in a sample of 80  victims from four states. Once victims were identified, they were  interviewed either in person or by phone, depending on the distance to  the store. Victims were interviewed for between 20 and 25 minutes. For  the offender file, within each of the five states analyses of  currently incarcerated robbers were conducted to identify those that  had been convicted of a convenience store robbery. A total of 147  incarcerated robbers were interviewed in person, in interviews lasting  on average from 25 to 40 minutes. Once data were collected from the  individual sites, the interviews were forwarded to a central location to ensure consistency and comparability in coding and data entry."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables unique to Part 1, the Victim Data file,  provide information on how the victim was injured, whether  hospitalization was required for the injury, if the victim used any  type of self-protection, and whether the victim had been trained to  handle a robbery.
