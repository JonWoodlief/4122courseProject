It explored antecedent maternal behaviors which might influence achievement development, as well as examined the contemporary correlates of achievement in young adulthood.\r\n<br /><br />  The study made use of longitudinal data in the records of the Fels Research Institute. Seventy-four of the original 96 children brought into the program between 1939 and 1947 were asked to return for follow-up. Sixty-five (or 88%) of these were able to return to the center for the adult assessment between 1965 and 1967. The final sample consisted of 38 males and 27 females aged 18 to 26.<br />  Historical data (maternal, childhood and adolescent) were obtained from the Fels files.\r\nThey included narrative reports of home visits, ratings of mothers' behaviors, nursery school and day camp observations, taped interviews with the children when they were adolescents. Standardized instruments (i.e., Gesell Developmental Schedule, Stanford-Binet, Wechsler-Bellevue, and Primary Mental Abilities tests) were administered at regular intervals. Physical measurements of participants and demographic characteristics of participants and parents were included.<br />  The current study conducted semistructured interviews with the children as young adults. The interview tapped a variety of motivational and behavioral variables related to academic, intellectual and vocational achievement and effort. Identification models, sex role attitudes, and social activities were also assessed. The investigator used four experimental tasks to measure competence, goal approach, conceptual tempo preference for intellectual vs. motor skills, and intellectual expectancy.\r\n<br /><br /> The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (paper).
