This study examined whether the  effect of economic distress on intimate violence was stronger in  disadvantaged or advantaged neighborhoods or was unaffected by  neighborhood conditions. This project was a secondary analysis of data  drawn from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and  Households (NSFH) and from the 1990 United States Census.

From the 1990 Census, the researchers abstracted  tract-level data on the characteristics of the census tracts in which  the NSFH respondents lived.

This study examined whether  the effect of economic distress on intimate violence was stronger in  disadvantaged or advantaged neighborhoods or unaffected by  neighborhood conditions. The researchers intended to answer the  following questions: (1) How do measures of community correlate with  the prevalence, frequency, severity, and duration of intimate  violence? (2) To what extent do different forms of economic distress  influence the use of violence by men against women in intimate  relationships? (3) How do changes in economic distress influence the  initiation, maintenance, desistence, and escalation of violence by men  in intimate relationships and to what extent do known precursors of  violence mediate the impact of changes in economic distress on  violence? (4) Does change over time in economic distress influence  intimate violence independently of community context and household  characteristics, or does it interact with these factors to produce  varying risk levels for women located in different types of areas and  households? (5) Are the effects\nof community context and economic  distress on intimate violence more pronounced for minority women, or do  they operate independently of race and other demographic characteristics?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data used for this project came from the first  and second waves of the National Survey of Families and Households  (NSFH) conducted by the Center for Demography and Ecology at the  University of Wisconsin-Madison [NATIONAL SURVEY OF FAMILIES AND  HOUSEHOLDS: WAVE I, 1987-1988, AND WAVE II, 1992-1994 (ICPSR  6906)]. The NSFH was designed to cover a broad range of family  structures, processes, and relationships with a large enough sample to  permit subgroup analysis. The first wave of the NSFH was conducted in  1988 and included a national probability sample of 13,017  respondents. Information was collected regarding the respondent's  family living arrangements in childhood, marital and cohabiting  experiences, education, fertility, alcohol use, employment history,  kin contact, and economic and psychological well-being. Five years  after the original interview, the sample from the first wave was  reinterviewed.
