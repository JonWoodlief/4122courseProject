The  evaluation of the RID program was undertaken to determine whether  county-operated boot camp programs for male inmates were feasible and  cost-effective, based on the Los Angeles experience.

The evaluation  design consists of both process and impact components to assess fully  the overall effects of the RID program on offenders and the county  jail system. The process component was designed to document how the  RID program actually operated in terms of its selection criteria,  delivery of programs, length of participation, and program completion  rates, as well as documenting how various program components were  modified over time in attempts to increase participation in the  program and keep the program operational. The impact component was to  assess the degree to which program objectives were met by measuring of  recidivism, program costs, institutional behavior, and RID's effect on  jail crowding. To achieve these objectives, a quasi-experimental  design was implemented. The research established statistically-matched  control and experimental populations to predict what would have  happened to offenders had the RID program not existed. Equivalency was  controlled through the administration of certain pre-test measures and  by ensuring that control cases were similar in key demographic and criminal history attributes."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include demographic/criminal data (e.g.,  race, date of birth, arrest charge, bail and amount, sentence days,  certificates acquired), historical state and county arrest data (e.g.,  date of crime, charge, disposition, probation time, jail time, type of  crime), boot camp data (e.g., entry into and exit from boot camp,  reason for exit, probation dates, living conditions, marital status,  employment status, income, resti\ntution order), drug history data  (e.g., drug used, frequency, method), data on drug tests, and serious incidence data."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cost effectiveness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"male offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prison inmates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"shock incarceration programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
