As a result, those states that only collected DNA from juveniles tried as adults were excluded. In states collecting from \"Youthful Offenders,\" only those states in which the term applied to juveniles processed in juvenile or family courts were included. The study sought to identify differences between adult and juvenile DNA collection, upload, and use. Juveniles processed in the juvenile justice system are typically afforded a\ndditional legal protections and interact with specialized courts, probation, and detention entities. When juveniles are prosecuted in the adult system, they are treated like their adult counterparts, and there is little reason to expect differentiated treatment for purposes of DNA processing. Moreover, criminal justice agencies are often unable to isolate juveniles tried as adults in their data systems. The data request sent to states emphasized the preference for information about juveniles handled in the juvenile system, but states with database systems that could not distinguish juvenile from criminal court jurisdiction were permitted to provide data for youth at or below the state's upper age of juvenile jurisdiction, or below 18.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Laboratory Interviews</strong></p>\n\n<p>The research team identified state CODIS lab supervisory staff for phone interviews in each of the 30 study states and completed semi-structured phone interviews with 29 of them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong></p>\n\n<p>Arizona, Texas, Kansas, Florida, and Illinois were selected for interviews with a broader group of stakeholders after considering the following criteria: volume of National DNA Index System (NDIS) profiles; scope of collection; geographical distribution; date of relevant law's enactment; and existing relationships with the laboratory.

In cities with centralized juvenile justice systems, researchers interviewed representatives from state agencies whenever possible.
