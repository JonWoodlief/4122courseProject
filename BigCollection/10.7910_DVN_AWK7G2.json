While male condoms are widely available and 95% of adults have heard of them, self-reported use in the past 12 months is low among young adults (45%). This study describes factors associated with non-use of male condoms among urban young adults in Zambia.\r\n\r\nMethods: A household cross-sectional survey in four urban districts was conducted from November 2015 to January 2016 among sexually active young adults ages 18-24 years. A random walk strategy was implemented in urban areas; eligible, enrolled participants were administered a survey on household characteristics, health access, and knowledge, attitudes and practices related to contraception. Relative risk regression models were built to determine factors associated with the decision to not use a male condom (non-use) at most recent sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nResults: A total of 2,388 individuals were interviewed; 69% were female, 35% were married, and average lifetime sex partners was 3.45 (SD±6.15). Non-use of male condoms was 59% at most recent sexual intercourse. In a multivariate model, women were more likely to report non-use of a male condom compared with men (aRR=1.24 [95% CI: 1.11, 1.38]), married individuals were more likely to report non-use compared with unmarried individuals (aRR=1.59 [1.46, 1.73]), and those residing in the highest poverty wards were more likely to report non-use compared with those in the lowest poverty wards (aRR=1.31 [1.16, 1.48]). Those with more negative perceptions of male condom use were 6% more likely to report non-use (aRR=1.06 [1.03, 1.09]). Discussion regarding contraception with a partner decreased non-use 13% (aRR=0.87 [0.80, 0.95]) and agreement regarding male condom use with a partner decreased non-use 16% (aRR=0.84 [0.77, 0.91)]).\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Non-use of male condoms is high among young, married adults, particularly women, who may be interested in contraception for family planning but remain at risk of STI infection. Effective marketing strategy of dual protection methods to this population is critical."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family planning"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Zambia"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Condoms"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Contraception"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social marketing"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV prevention"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Poverty"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Youth"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"USAID"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Research Support, Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-03-03"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey data","Administrative data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stata"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"13"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Zambia"},"city":{"typeName":"city","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lusaka"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individual"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Youth between 18 and 24 who reported sexual activity in the last 6 months."]},{"typeName":"dataCollector","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A cross-sectional survey of young individuals (aged 18-24 years) living in 40 urban wards (administrative units) in Zambia was conducted between November 2015 and January 2016. This survey was conducted as a baseline survey for a larger impact evaluation of a female condom intervention (AEA ID: AEARCTR-0000899).  The population of the city of Lusaka is about 3 million; 40 urban wards from the districts of Lusaka (31 wards), Chilanga (3 wards), Kafue (3 wards) and Chongwe (3 wards) comprise the study area. These 40 wards were included in the survey, and each ward is divided into census enumeration areas. \r\n The geographic centroid was calculated for each census enumeration area in the 40 wards using ArcGIS v10.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). In each ward, five centroid points were randomly selected (and five additional points to use as back up). Survey teams were directed to these randomly selected centroid points (as the starting point) using GPS devices (Garmin International, Inc., Olathe, KS). Once the survey teams arrived at the centroid points, surveyors approached every other house walking in four separate directions (north, south, east and west) from the start point. If no one was home, the surveyors attempted a second visit. Households were recorded as visited, refused, or no one home (after the two attempts). If someone was present, surveyors entered and introduced the study, and took a roster of all household members present. Inclusion criteria for the study included being 18-24 years of age, residing in that house for at least 6 months, and being sexually active. If more than one household member was eligible, one was randomly selected using SurveyCTO (Dobility Inc, Cambridge MA). All eligible participants that gave verbal and written informed consent were enrolled in the study. Surveyors were trained to conduct the questionnaire in a private setting, usually within the household, where no one else could overhear responses. Participants received 10 kwacha (1 USD) scratch off cards for mobile phone use as compensation for their participation.\r\n The survey administered was approximately 45 minutes long, and asked All participants gave written informed consent and the project was approved by both the Innovations for Poverty Action Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Zambia’s ERES IRB."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In-person interviews"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This is the master do-file for the baseline
