Other questions elicit demographic information, including sex, age, parental education and occupation, household income, race, religious preference, and state of birth. Specific questions asked of respondents in the 1972 survey included students' activities during high school, students' activities during the past year, and students' and parents' ethnicity."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career choice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"college freshmen"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"college students"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"education costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational background"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"student financial aid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"student values"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.

The 1991 edition of this report provides the following summary: \"The institutions identified as part of the national population are divided into 37 stratification groups based on institutional race (predominantly white vs. predominantly black), type (two-year college, four-year college, university), control (public, private nonsectarian, Roman Catholic and Protestant) and, for four-year colleges and universities, the selectivity level of the institution (for two-year colleges, enrollment is used in place of selectivity). Selectivity, defined as the average composite SAT score of the entering class, was made an integral part of the stratification design in 1968, and was revised and updated in 1975. Those institutions identified as being part of the Norms [national] sample are then weighted by a two-step procedure. In the first step, the counts of male and female FTFT [first-time full-time] population for each institution are divided by that institution's male and female FTFT respondent count. The resulting weights, when applied, bring the male and female respondent counts up to the corresponding counts for the population of that institution. The weighted counts for all participating institutions in each stratification cell are then summed, and divided into the national male and female FTFT counts for all institutions in that stratification cell. The resulting between-institution weights bring the male and female counts for each stratification cell up to\nthe corresponding national counts for that stratification cell.\"; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002-10-11"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1972"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1972"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["self-enumerated questionnaires"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["All institutions of higher education with entering freshman classes listed in the fall enrollment files of the Higher Education General Information Survey/Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (HEGIS/IPEDS) data collections."]},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) [United States] Freshman Survey, 1972","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37140,"dataFile":{"id":2624762,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) [United States] Freshman Survey, 1972","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
