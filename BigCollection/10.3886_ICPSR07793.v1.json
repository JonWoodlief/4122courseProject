A questionnaire sent to the deans of 17 types of   professional schools focused both on aspects common to other types of   organizations (e.g., size, administrative structure, degree of   structural differentiation, decentralization of decision making) and on   those characteristics unique to professional schools (e.g., the   school's relationship to the university). Other university-specific   information collected from published sources includes the size and   composition of the faculty, the size and composition of the   undergraduate and graduate population, admission requirements, average   SAT scores, the number and type of degrees conferred, and financial   statistics. In addition, profession-specific information is presented   such as the age and sex composition, and median earnings of the   occupation at the 1970 census, accreditation procedures, and  characteristics of professional associations."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
