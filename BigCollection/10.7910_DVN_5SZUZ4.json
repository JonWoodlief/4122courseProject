Two FGDs per village in three villages. FGDs were held separately for men and women in order to collect gender disaggregated data\r\nIn each of the three villages, two focus group discussions were held separately. One with men and the other with women. Each group will deal with the three aspects for discussion:\r\nUseful biological diversity in the production system; Market diversity; and Dietary diversity.  There were between 10-16 participants in each group. Each group tried to include a cross-section of individuals involved in agricultural production or at least collecting useful plants from common lands and the wild, representing different levels of access to land (land owners, local land renters and migrant land renters), different ethnic groups present in the village and different age groups (special emphasis should be placed to include younger farmers). For each group there were two facilitators, one to guide the exercise and the other to document the process (take notes, photographs, etc.). The  data were elicited using the four-square methodology explained in the Protocol document.\r\nThe three villages survey were in the Sikasso District of Mali: Fakoro (Lat 12°13074, Lon 005°20156); Kani (Lat 12°15011, Lon 005°10827); N'goutjina (Lat 12°17961, Lon 005°28372)"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AGRICULTURE"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"BIODIVERSITY"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DIET"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DIVERSIFICATION"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"STRATEGIES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MARKETS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PARTICIPATION"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bioversity International"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-12-02"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-12-11"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-01-04"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Household/Survey data"]},{"typeName":"otherReferences","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["CRP 1.1: CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Agricultural Production Systems"]}]}},"files":[{"label":"Mali_FGD_Data.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":97323,"dataFile":{"id":2966264,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/5SZUZ4/PINSW3","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5SZUZ4/PINSW3","filename":"Mali_FGD_Data.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":170982,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1591b8b4e4c-a272db6595b2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b5d2acb988aa8f0ed9de5309ec933f8f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b5d2acb988aa8f0ed9de5309ec933f8f"}}}]}}}
