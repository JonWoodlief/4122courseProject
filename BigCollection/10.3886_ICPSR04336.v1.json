Demographic data refer to the time of  the interview in 1999 for the 1998 data year. Economic data include  comprehensive work experience information given on the employment  status, occupation, industry, weeks worked and hours per week worked,  total income, and income components for persons aged 15 and over.

Income data cover  income sources such as income from jobs, net income from businesses,  farm or rent, pensions, dividends, interest, and social security  payments. Data on income refer to the preceding year. Noncash benefits  data cover noncash income sources such as food stamps, the school  lunch program, employer-provided group health insurance plan,  employer-provided pension plans, personal health insurance, Medicaid,  Medicare, CHAMPUS/Tricare or military health care, and energy  assistance.

An original sample  person is a sample person who was a self or proxy respondent in Wave 1  of the SIPP 1992 or 1993 panel. A nonoriginal sample person is a  sample person who became part of the sample after the SIPP Wave 1 and  beyond (including the SPD samples). The SIPP 1992 and 1993 Panel  samples, from which the SPD sample originated, were designed to  produce only national estimates of the characteristics of interest to  the user. Although this 1999 cross-sectional file includes state  identifiers and is weighted to current state (as well as national)  controls, deriving subnational estimates from this 9-year-old sample  that has experienced severe attrition (household and person  nonresponse) and other sample loss (through death,  institutionalization, etc.) as well as sample cuts dictated by  budgetary constraints, results in inadequate representativeness and  poor coverage in some of the smaller geographic areas. Even for the  national estimates, inadequate representativeness and poor coverage  occur in children of all races as well as Black adults aged 20 to  39. In addition to noninterview adjustment, the Bureau of the Census  attempted to further correct for these deficiencies by bringing back  noninterviews from the 1997 Bridge sample and from a subset of the  SIPP 1992/1993 Panels.
