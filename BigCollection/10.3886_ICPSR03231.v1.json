The study was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and  opinions about the 2000 presidential election. Respondents were asked  to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of  the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy, as well as their  opinions of both candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor  George W. Bush. Those polled were asked whether they participated in  the last presidential election on November 7, 2000, whom they voted  for, whether they were satisfied with the outcome of the election, and  whether Bush legitimately won the election. A number of questions  examined respondents' views about George W. Bush being president: what  kind of president Bush would be, what worried them about Bush, whether  Bush could be trusted to deal with all problems a president has to  deal with, whether he cared about ordinary people, and whether he  would be able to lead the country effectively, work with members of  both parties, improve education, reduce costs of prescription drug  coverage for seniors, reduce taxes, and strengthen and reform Social  Security. The survey also queried respondents on the most important  things they wanted Bush to accomplish, the way the Bush and Gore  campaigns handled the election, how much trust they had in the United  States Supreme Court, if they approved of its decision that stopped  the manual recount in Florida, the effects of the presidential  election controversy on American democracy, whether the vote count in  Florida was fair and accurate, whom voters in Florida intended to vote  for, and whether Gore withdrew from the race at the right time. The  poll also elicited respondents' views on the economic situation in the  country, the tax cut proposal, the budget surplus, federal funding to  reward schools that improve students' performance, increase in defense  spending, and a proposal that would allow individuals to invest a  portion of their Social Security savings on their own. The survey also  collected information on respondents' use of computers and the  Internet. Those polled were asked whether they had access to a  computer and to the Internet, and if so where, and if they had an  e-mail address, whether they shopped on-line, whether they bought  gifts during the 1999 and 2000 holiday seasons on the Internet, and if  they were going to do so in the future. Internet shoppers also  compared the on-line and store shopping experiences. Background  information on respondents includes age, gender, education,  race/ethnic identity, voter registration, political party affiliation,  political orientation, marital status, number of children in the household, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George
