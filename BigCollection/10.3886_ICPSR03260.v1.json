The project  examined the extent to which the relationship between various  structural factors and crime varied across metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan locations in Appalachia over time. To investigate the  spatial patterns of crime, a georeferenced dataset was compiled at the  county level for each of the 399 counties comprising the Appalachian  region. The data came from numerous secondary data sources, including  the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, the  Decennial Census of the United States, the Department of Agriculture,  and the Appalachian Regional Commission. Data were gathered on the  demographic distribution, change, and composition of each county, as  well as other socioeconomic indicators. The dependent variables were  index crime rates derived from the Uniform Crime Reports, with  separate variables for violent and property crimes. These data were  integrated into a GIS database in order to enhance the research with  respect to: (1) data integration and visualization, (2) exploratory  spatial analysis, and (3) confirmatory spatial analysis and  statistical modeling.
