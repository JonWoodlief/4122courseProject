Data are based on the National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse Central registry form.  The form collects details on all children and parents in the family in which abuse or neglect is suspected, and the role played by each parent and/or child.  Topics include age, gender, ethnicity and relationship of household members, stress factors in home, role of parent/child/perpetrator, marital status, whether or not abuse or neglect was substantiated.
