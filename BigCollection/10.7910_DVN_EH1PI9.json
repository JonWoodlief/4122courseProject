I find that none of these interventions had a significant effect (whether economically or statistically) on take-up, and that the gender of the household member targeted was also irrelevant. In contrast, I find that take-up is sensitive to price, as in Cohen and Dupas (2008), and is correlated with indicators of household’s wealth."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Government policy"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Regulation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Public health"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Economic development"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Malaria"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Product pricing"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Technology adoption"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Acumen Fund"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Adessium Foundation"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Exxon Mobil Foundation"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sumitomo Chemical"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Research Support, Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-01-06"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stata"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"13"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.99.2.224"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Kenya"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Household"]},{"typeName":"dataCollector","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Enumerators"},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In each market area, a list of 150 to 200 households was compiled from school registers. Single-headed households were excluded. Remaining households on the list were randomly assigned to: a subsidy level; one of three “marketing” groups; one of two “commitment” groups; and one of three “targeting” groups. After the random assignment (performed in office), trained enumerators visited each sampled household to administer a baseline survey. At the end of the interview, the household was given a voucher for an LL-ITN at the randomly assigned subsidy level. Vouchers could be redeemed within three months at participating local retailers. At the time they received the voucher, households were exposed to a randomly assigned marketing message. In the “health framing” group, morbidity and mortality due to malaria were emphasized. In the “financial framing” group, households were asked to think about the financial gains they would realize (from averting medical costs and loss of daily income) if they could prevent malaria. The remaining third of households did not receive any marketing message. Also, at the time they received the voucher, half the households were asked if they intended to buy the LL-ITN and who would sleep under it after they had bought it. Finally, the gender of the household head to whom the voucher was given and to whom the various marketing interventions were made was randomly chosen. The marketing was directed to the female head for a third of households, to the male head for another third, and to both of them jointly in the last third."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In-person surveys"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This file contains user-written commands needed to run the code.","label":"adofiles.zip","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"What Matters Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":97404,"dataFile":{"id":2969223,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/5E74JG","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/5E74JG","filename":"adofiles.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":82874,"description":"This file contains user-written commands needed to run the code.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15976f60a99-20ee24840841","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6c2d40d88c9d11d353120b882d11d38f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6c2d40d88c9d11d353120b882d11d38f"}}},{"description":"This is the code used to produce all tables and figures published in the publication.","label":"DUPAS_P&Ppaper_code.do","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"What Matters Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":97404,"dataFile":{"id":2969224,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/9LGD9W","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/9LGD9W","filename":"DUPAS_P&Ppaper_code.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":18971,"description":"This is the code used to produce all tables and figures published in the publication.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15976f60ab6-67715048be80","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"098e46866759de5545e206d031e6c553","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"098e46866759de5545e206d031e6c553"}}},{"description":"This is the de-identified dataset.","label":"PandP_data.tab","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"What Matters Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":97404,"dataFile":{"id":2969225,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/YU5GFO","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/YU5GFO","filename":"PandP_data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":190138,"description":"This is the de-identified dataset.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15976f60ac9-efe8d729da67","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata-13","originalFormatLabel":"Stata 13 Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:kg1boE0DzVy6yHn1CEKrrA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4ad957805ff05739857920a32390fb9a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4ad957805ff05739857920a32390fb9a"}}},{"description":"This folder contains all files to replicate the publication.","label":"What Matters Dataverse Files.zip","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"What Matters Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":97404,"dataFile":{"id":2969226,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/TPQGRD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/TPQGRD","filename":"What Matters Dataverse Files.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":143651,"description":"This folder contains all files to replicate the publication.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15976f60ad7-d3c4e42e2ab7","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"915bc3117210b6d347e241bedad90b8f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"915bc3117210b6d347e241bedad90b8f"}}},{"description":"This ReadMe file contains basic information on the data, code, accompanying documentation, and software compatibility.","label":"What Matters Readme.docx","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"What Matters Dataverse Files/What Matters Dataverse Files/What Matters Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":97404,"dataFile":{"id":2969227,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/G99FEH","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EH1PI9/G99FEH","filename":"What Matters Readme.docx","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":18285,"description":"This ReadMe file contains basic information on the data, code, accompanying documentation, and software compatibility.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15976f60b85-675481ddc2f6","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2d8f8e34fc5ba117603f60493c38b178","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2d8f8e34fc5ba117603f60493c38b178"}}}]}}}
