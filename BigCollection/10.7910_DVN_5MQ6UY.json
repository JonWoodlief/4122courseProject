This stress acts to reinforce the shear flow at this location and the flow drive gets stronger as heating is increased. The L-H transition ensues when the rate of work done by this stress is strong enough to drive the shear flow to large values, which then grows at the expense of the turbulence intensity. The drop in turbulence intensity momentarily reduces the heat flux across the magnetic flux surface, which then allows the edge plasma pressure gradient to build. A sufficiently strong ion pressure gradient then locks in the H-mode state. These results are in general agreement with previously published reduced 0D and 1D predator prey models. An extended predator–prey model including separate ion and electron heat channels yields a non-monotonic power threshold dependence on plasma density provided that the fraction of heat deposited on the ions increases with plasma density. Possible mechanisms to explain other macroscopic transition threshold criteria are identified. A number of open questions and unexplained observations are identified, and must be addressed and resolved in order to build a physics-based model that can yield predictions of the macroscopic conditions needed for accessing H-mode."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"h-mode"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physics-based modeling"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"plasma density"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"plasma turbulence"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"shear flow"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/15ja/15ja089/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-15-89</a><br /><br />This work was supported U.S. DOE grants DE-FC02-99ER54512-CMOD, DE-SC0008689, DE-SC0008378 and DE-SC0001961."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"15ja089_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149390,"dataFile":{"id":3341456,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"15ja089_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":4663799,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1683930a98e-2d8316f07b65","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3a52637cf91894875cc7f7c8df7a2397","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3a52637cf91894875cc7f7c8df7a2397"}}}]}}}
