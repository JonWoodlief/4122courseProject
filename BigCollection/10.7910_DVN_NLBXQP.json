The main objective of\r\nthe goal-directed research in this article is to uncover to what\r\nextent social psychological processes play a role in this seeming\r\n“disconnect” between what people “say” and what they actually\r\n“do.” A total of 63 (n = 63) participants volunteered to partake in\r\nthe study. The results indicate that healthcare participants indicate\r\nhigher levels of social empathy, social perspective taking, and\r\nwillingness to reach out and share resources as compared with\r\nthose in social care during the explicit studies. Yet, the implicit\r\ndata suggest a moderate to strong automatic biaswhich maywell\r\nhinder integration efforts. We provide a way forward to increase\r\nthe validity of these methods and provide recommendations for\r\npolicy within health and social care integration in England. In\r\naddition, these recommendations have wider application to areas\r\nconcerned with organizational change such as; mergers, acquisitions,\r\nand other collaborative working arrangements."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-12-06"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Groen, Bernard M"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-05-17"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Journal of Enterprise Transformation Article","label":"Why integrated healthcare is harder than we think","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":126457,"dataFile":{"id":3018215,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/NLBXQP/WXPKNS","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NLBXQP/WXPKNS","filename":"Why integrated healthcare is harder than we think","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":750807,"description":"Journal of Enterprise Transformation Article","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15c15b25c18-42d2b13be98f","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2ea5b4bb3988a380f1a64f0d6324462a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2ea5b4bb3988a380f1a64f0d6324462a"}}}]}}}
