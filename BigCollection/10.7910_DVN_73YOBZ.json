This was a comparison study between pre-responses and post-responses after an educational intervention. Twelve students and 10 professors of Seoul National University College of Medicine participated in this study from March 3, 2017 to June 16, 2017. Professors were recruited on a volunteer basis, including 8 professors in clinical medicine, 1 in pharmacology, and the director of ‘Center for Gendered Innovations in Science and Technology Research, Korea Federation of Women’'s Science & Technology Associations.’ The professors taught 12 students and participated as subjects of the survey. The survey tool was adopted from Chin et al. and somewhat modified.
