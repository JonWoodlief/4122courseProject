To understand the complex dynamics of today's families and the  strategies they use to balance the demands of work and family, over  500 families from 8 cities across the United States were studied.  To  address different issues facing parents with older and younger  children, families with adolescents and families with kindergartners  were included in the sample. Working mothers and fathers are now  splitting their time between their responsibilities to their family,  and to their respective occupations. This study of 500 families  explores how work affects the lives and well-being of parents and  their children.</p>\n\n<p>The study's data allows researchers to explore  a broad range of questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How do dual-career families manage and organize their resources and time  between family and work?</li>\n<li>How do work conditions, including  characteristics of the job and workplace environment, affect the  quality of relationships among household members?</li>\n<li>How do  dual career parents manage the moral and social development and  learning experiences\nof their children?</li>\n<li>How do the  work-related responsibilities of working parents affect their child's  moral, social, and educational development?</li>\n<li>What effect is  consumerism and technology having on how working families direct the  moral and social development of their children?</li>\n<li>What do  parents believe is their role regarding the child-care of their  children and how they should fulfill that role both in terms of time  and in the allocation of economic and social resources? What are some  of the resources in the community that parents use to supervise their  children?</li>\n<li>How do families regard the \"free time\" of  adolescents and how they allocate adolescent \"free time\" in  maintenance of the household?</li>\n<li>What is the quality of  relationships among family members?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To obtain a  detailed picture of work and family life, mothers, fathers, and their  children were asked to complete a series of instruments including  surveys, in-depth interviews, and time diaries.  These instruments  were designed to provide information about work, marriage, child care  and parental supervision, management of household tasks, time  allocations, coping strategies, and psychological well-being.</p>\n\n<p>The four datasets associated with this data collection are  summarized below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The\n<strong>Cortisol Data</strong>\ncontains information for a  subsample of families that elected to participate in a study of  psychological stress. Parents and teenagers who agreed to participate  completed an additional two days of ESM data collection. The health  survey that was administered reported on a variety of health and  lifestyle issues that might affect cortisol (stress hormone) levels  such as medication use, consumption of caffeine and alcohol, use of  nicotine, timing of menstrual cycle, pregnancy, presence of chronic  illness, and respondent's height and weight. Additionally, parents  reported on the health of the children (teenagers and kindergartners)  participating in the study.</li>\n<li>The\n<strong>Experience Sampling Method (ESM) Data</strong>\ncontains a  variety of information related to how individuals spend their time,  who they spent it with, and what activities they were engaged in over  the course of a typical week. Respondents wore programmed wrist  watches that emitted signals (beeps) throughout the day. When  possible, family members were placed on identical signaling schedules  to provide information on a range of family activities. At the time of  each beep, participants were asked to complete a self-report form  which asked them to answer a number of open-ended questions about  their location, activities, who they were with, and psychological  states. Several Likert and semantic-differential scales were used to  assess participants' psychological states.</li>\n<li>The\n<strong>Parent Data</strong>\ncontains basic demographic  information from respondents as well as detailed information about  parents' occupation job duties, income, work schedule, benefits (e.g.,  medical care, flexible work schedules, and family leave), and the  consequences of their jobs (e.g. long hours, job stress, having to  work weekends).  Additionally, the data contain information about the  extent to which parents experienced work-family conflict and what  changes might help with better balance of the demands of work and  family (e.g., more flexible work hours, more help from spouses with  household and child care responsibilities, improved child care, and  after-school care arrangements). Parental attitudes toward traditional  arrangements, how household tasks were actually divided among family  members, and how often the family paid for services (e.g., cleaning,  yard work, meal preparation) were also captured. The data also contain  information about how children are socialized in families with two  working parents. Topics about the frequency with which parents engaged  in various acti\nvities with their children (e.g., talking, eating meals  together, attending religious services), how frequently parents  monitored their teenager's activities, and how often they talked with  their teenager about school activities, plans for college, career  plans, friendships, and peer pressure.</li>\n<li>The\n<strong>Adolescent Data</strong>\ncontains data for sixth through  twelfth graders, which focuses on family relationships and  experiences, school experiences, paid work, psychological well-being  and behavioral problems, and plans for the future (e.g., college,  career, and marriage -- including expectations regarding spouses'  sharing of responsibility for child care, cooking, chores, and paid  work). To allow for comparison of parents' and adolescents' responses  to similar questions, several items appear in both the adolescent and  parent data. These items include the frequency with which parents and  adolescents discuss school events, college and career plans,  participation in religious and other activities, gender role attitudes  and the division of household tasks within the family, and items  measuring depression, stress, and anxiety.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Qualitative Data -- Interviews</strong>\nThe main  purpose of the interviews was to explore topics addressed in the  parent and adolescent surveys in greater detail. Parent interviews  were designed to examine how working parents cope with the demands of  work and family life. Adolescent interviews touched on similar themes  but altered questions to gauge the adolescent's perceptions of their  parents work and family lives. Kindergartner interviews were brief and  focused on children's after-school and child care arrangements and time spent with parents.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adolescents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child
