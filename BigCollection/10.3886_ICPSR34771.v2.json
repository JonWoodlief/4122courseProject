The supplemental assessments used were Stanford 9 Open-Ended Reading Assessment in grades 4 through 8, Balanced Assessment in Mathematics (BAM) in grades 4 through 8, and the ACT QualityCore series for Algebra I, English 9, and Biology.</p>\n\n<p>Panoramic digital video of classroom sessions were taken of participating teachers and students, teachers submitted commentary on their lessons (e.g., specifying the learning objective) and then trained raters scored the lesson based on classroom observation protocols using the following five observation protocols:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS), developed by Robert Pianta, University of Virginia</li>\n<li>Framework for Teaching, developed by Charlotte Danielson</li>\n<li>Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI), developed by Heather Hill, Harvard University, and Deborah Loewenberg Ball, University of Michigan</li>\n<li>Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observations (PLATO), developed by Pam Grossman, Stanford University</li>\n<li>Quality Science Teaching (QST) Instrument, developed by Raymond Pecheone, Stanford University</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A subset of the videos also are being scored using an observational protocol developed by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) and using the UTeach Observational Protocol (UTOP), developed by the UTeach Preparation Program.</p>\n\n<p>Close to 3,000 teacher volunteers from across the following six, predominantly urban, school districts participated in the MET project: Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Dallas Independent School District, Denver Public Schools, Hillsborough County Public Schools, Memphis City Schools, and the New York City Department of Education.

Also included in the file are variables that indicate the grade of the student, their randomization block and exchange group and section each student was assigned to.</li>\n<li><strong>Video Information File</strong>\n- This file contains descriptive information about the videos captured for the MET project. Variables found in the file include the ID of the video, as well as IDs for the district, school, teacher and section related to each video, the subject, grade, and year of the video and whether the file is available for users to view.</li>\n<li><strong>Subject ID Crosswalk</strong>\n- This file contains only ID variables and is included to describe the associations between districts, schools, teachers, sections and students.</li>\n<li><strong>Teacher Demographics File</strong>\n- This file contains descriptive information about the teachers in the MET project.
