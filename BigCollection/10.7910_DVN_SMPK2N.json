Each constituency-year is coded 1 or 0 depending on whether or not the constituency became the subject of an official investigation for the Reichstag’s Election Investigation Committee.  If the committee deemed that the election in a constituency in a particular year was possibly subject to some form of malpractice or fraud and thus needing investigation, the constituency receives a score of 1.  If the committee decided that elections in a district in a year did not need investigation, the constituency receives a score of 0.  The data also records the gross number of petitioned cases during the entire 1871-1914 period (including multiple investigations of the same seat in a single year) and the net number of seats investigated, excluding the multiple investigations of a single disputed seat within a given year. The source for these scores is the Reichstag Parliamentary Minutes (Stenographische Berichte, 1871-1914) as originally collected\nfor research by Robert Arsenschek"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"“Shaping Democratic Practice and the Causes of Electoral Fraud: The Case of Nineteenth Century Germany” American Political Science Review 103 (1): 1-21"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-08-24"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1871"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1914"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Germany"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Arsenschek_Ziblatt.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":62476,"dataFile":{"id":2137965,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Arsenschek_Ziblatt.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":29862,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:62389","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:+ntpuzxNl4qKgbRqwERvMw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"693738177fedbee913c658eb1b5cb554","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"693738177fedbee913c658eb1b5cb554"}}}]}}}
