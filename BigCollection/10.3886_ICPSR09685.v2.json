The principal investigators identified three areas of study.  First, they looked at blood alcohol content of drivers involved in  fatal accidents in relation to changes in the drinking age. Second,  they looked at how arrest rates correlated with changes in the drinking  age. Finally, they looked at the relationship between blood alcohol  content and arrest rates. In this context, the investigators used the  percentage of drivers killed in fatal automobile accidents who had  positive blood alcohol content as an indicator of drinking in the  population. Arrests were used as a measure of crime, and arrest rates  per capita were used to create comparability across states and over  time. Arrests for certain crimes as a proportion of all arrests were  used for other analyses to compensate for trends that affect the  probability of arrests in general. This collection contains three  parts. Variables in the Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime Data file  (Part 1) include the state and year to which the data apply, the type of  crime, and the sex and age category of those arrested for crimes. A  single arrest is the unit of analysis for this file. Information in  the Population Data file (Part 2) includes population counts for the  number of individuals within each of seven age categories, as well as  the number in the total population. There is also a figure for the number  of individuals covered by the reporting police agencies from which data  were gathered. The individual is the unit of analysis. The Fatal Accident  Data file (Part 3) includes six variables: the FIPS code for the state,  year of accident, and the sex, age group, and blood alcohol content of  the individual killed. The final variable in each record is a count of  the number of drivers killed in fatal motor vehicle accidents for that  state and year who fit into the given sex, age, and blood alcohol content grouping. A driver killed in a fatal accident is the unit of analysis."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol consumption"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arrest rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drinking age"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"driving under the influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fatalities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"traffic accidents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
