Parties can either form a pre-electoral coalition prior to election or they can compete independently and form a government coalition afterwards. While there is a vast literature on government coalitions, little is known about pre-electoral coalitions. I present a systematic analysis of these coalitions using a new dataset I constructed containing information on all potential pre-electoral coalition dyads in 20 industrialized parliamentary democracies from 1946 to 1998. I find that pre-electoral coalitions are more likely to form between ideologically compatible parties. They are also more likely to form when the expected coalition size is large (but not too large) and the potential coalition partners are similar in size. Finally, they are more likely to form if the party system is ideologically polarized and the electoral rules are disproportional."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pre-electoral coalitions, parliamentary democracies, coalition formation"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sona Nadenichek Golder, \"Pre-Electoral Coalition Formation in Parliamentary Democracies\" British Journal of Political Science March 2006 (Vol. 36, No. 2, pp. 193-212)."}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sona Golder"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sona Golder"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-08-30"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1946"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1998"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Advanced industrialized parliamentary democracies"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Zip file contains all data, do-files, and documentation necessary to replicate all results and figures in the the article.","label":"replication_BJPS.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":66645,"dataFile":{"id":1346992,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"replication_BJPS.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":293529,"description":"Zip file contains all data, do-files, and documentation necessary to replicate all results and figures in the the article.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15298","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1f6b914529086cb1a67a1acd8c916d09","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1f6b914529086cb1a67a1acd8c916d09"}}}]}}}
