Views were sought on the campaign against terrorism, the war with Iraq, and President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency and issues such as the economy, education, Social Security, foreign affairs, and health insurance. Respondents were asked about the condition of the national economy, whether the country was going in the right or wrong direction, whether most Americans were better or worse off financially than they were in 2001 when Bush became president, their level of concern that they or a household member would lose their job in the next year, and whether recent price increases in gasoline had caused them any financial hardship. Several questions asked how closely respondents were following the 2004 presidential campaign, whether they would vote for President Bush, Democratic candidate John Kerry, or Independent candidate Ralph Nader, the strength of their support for Bush or Kerry, which candidate could be trusted to deal with the main problems facing the nation in the next few years, and the importance of issues such as the economy, the situation in Iraq, and same-sex marriage in their vote. Respondents were also polled on whether the war with Iraq was worth fighting, whether it contributed to the long-term security of the United States, whether the number of United States military casualties in Iraq so far was acceptable, whether military forces in Iraq should be increased, and whether they should remain until civil order was restored in Iraq, even if it meant continued United States military casualties. Other questions asked how closely respondents were following the news about the commission investigating the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, whether the government did all it reasonably could to try to prevent the terrorist attacks, whether the Bush administration was doing a better job handling intelligence about terrorist threats since the attacks, and whether President George W. Bush and former President Bill Clinton should bear any personal responsibility for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Opinions were also solicited on whether the Bush administration had a clear plan for handling the situation in Iraq, whether the United States should proceed with its plans to transfer political power to a temporary government in Iraq on June 30, 2004, and whether this transfer would be symbolic or a real change of power. Additional topics addressed the effects of the result of the war with Iraq on the stability of the Middle East and the strength of the United States position in the world. Background information includes sex, age, education, ethnicity, marital status, religion, employment status, household income, social class, political orientation, political party affiliation, number of children living in the household, whether the respondent or a household member was currently serving in the military or was a military veteran, labor union membership, and voter registration and participation history."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush Administration (George W., 2001-2009)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"campaign issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Iraq War"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Kerry, John"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Nader, Ralph"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political campaigns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"September 11 attack"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
