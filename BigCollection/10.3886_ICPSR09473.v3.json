There was one respondent record for each of the 8,450 women in the survey. These records included most of the information from the interview and contain approximately 1,330 variables. Following each woman's respondent record were the interval records, one for each of her closed pregnancy intervals (completed pregnancies) yielding approximately 180 variables in each interval record cover information about the characteristics of each pregnancy and any contraceptive methods used during that interval. The hierarchical files have, however, been replaced by two rectangular ASCII files (respondent and interval).;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Data for CYCLE I, 1973 (ICPSR 7898), CYCLE II, 1976 (ICPSR 7902, 8181), CYCLE III, 1982 (ICPSR 8328), CYCLE IV, 1990 TELEPHONE REINTERVIEW (ICPSR 6643), and CYCLE V, 1995 (ICPSR 6960), and CYCLE VI, 2002 (ICPSR 4157) are also available from ICPSR.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The following codes are undocumented for variable A_4 (State where R was born: 227, 318, 395, 407, 593, 775, 886).;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Due to certain Stata restrictions some value labels were omitted from the data collection.
