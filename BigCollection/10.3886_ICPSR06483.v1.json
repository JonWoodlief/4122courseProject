The objectives were to collect data  on domestic violence in greater detail than previously possible,  conduct various analyses on this information, and determine how the  findings could best be used to improve the police, prosecutorial, and  social service response to domestic violence. Some of the important  questions this project attempted to address were: Are there any  variations in the patterns of domestic abuse based on neighborhood  demographics? What types of relationships are most prone to such  behavior? How often are children involved/present? How often does an  incident involve a restraining order violation? How often are injuries  incurred? How often and why are charges dropped against offenders?  What is the rate of revictimization? What role, if any, does the  criminal background of the offender play? To what extent are drugs and/or alcohol involved?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The study was conducted in two districts within  Boston, Massachusetts: district B3, which encompasses Mattapan and  North Dorchester, and district D4, which encompasses the South End,  Back Bay, and portions of the Fenway area. The project involved both  retrospective and prospective data collection and analysis phases.  The retrospective phase involved collecting a random sample of  incidents from the two pilot districts from throughout the 1993  calendar year. After the sample selection process was completed, data  from police incident reports, follow-up investigation reports,  criminal history reports, and court dockets were entered into the  database. Since backgroun\nd checks were performed in February of 1994,  the researchers were able to obtain information on the offenders'  criminal conduct since the 1993 sample incident as well as their prior  alleged criminal history. The prospective phase of the project  consisted of collecting current data for 1994 and comparing it with  the 1993 sample, to improve the domestic violence database and to  provide the domestic violence detectives with a case management tool.  During the period from May to July 1994, 736 incidents were collected  for District 3 and 416 incidents for District 4 from the domestic  violence-related police incident reports of the Department's Field  Reports Unit. The opportunity the prospective phase offered was the  ability of the detectives to speak with victims and to relay this  information to the researchers during the project. To assist with  this, the researchers developed a Victim Interview Form for the  detectives to complete after speaking with the victims. This allowed  more data to be collected than could be collected for the 1993  incidents. Conversely, the 1994 criminal history information was less  informative because the time frame was only, at most, four months. In  addition, data were not collected from original court dockets for the  1994 incidents because the majority of the cases were still pending at  the time of the project. A key component of the Project was the  establishment of a \"Partnership Group\" involving criminal justice  agencies, community social service organizations, and a variety of  advocate groups. The Partnership Group provided a wide variety of  perspectives on the issue of domestic violence, and allowed the  Project to be responsive to a broad range of public agencies beyond  law enforcement. During initial discussions, each member described the  types of information that would be most useful for problem-solving and  prevention of domestic violence. These discussions contributed to the  construction of the initial variable list of the Project. The  Partnership Group later reviewed and improved upon the 1993 database  design for use with the 1994 data. For purposes of this project, a  \"violent offense\" was defined as any form of assault against a  person, including threats. If the assault was further defined as a  domestic situation on the offender's criminal history sheet, it was  categorized as a \"domestic violence offense\". Domestic violence was  defined within the Boston Police Department as the occurrence of one  or more of the following acts between family or household members:  causing or attempting to cause physical harm, placing another in fear  of imminent physical harm, or causing another to engage involuntarily  in sexual relations by force, threat, or duress. Family or household  members were considered persons who either were currently or had been  married to one another, were or had been residing together in the same  household, were or had been related by blood or marriage, had a child  in common regardless of whether they had ever been married to each  other or lived together, or were or had been in a substantive dating  or engagement relationship, considering the length and type of  relationship, the frequency of interaction, and the length of time since the termination of the relationship."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were collected on a number of areas, including  arrest offenses, time of incident, location of incident, witnesses  (including children), nature and extent of injuries, drug and alcohol  use, history of similar incidents, whether there were restraining  orders in effect, and basic demographic information on victims and  offenders.
