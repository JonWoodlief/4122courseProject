These measures parallel those in a national longitudinal sample of midlife Americans known as MIDUS (ICPSR 4652: MIDUS II and ICPSR 2760: MIDUS I). The central objective is to compare the Japanese sample (MIDJA) with the United States sample (MIDUS) to test the hypothesis that the construct of interdependence predicts well-being and health in Japan, whereas the construct of independence predicts well-being and health in the United\nStates. Cultural influences on age differences in health and well-being are also of interest."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The overarching goal of the MIDJA (Midlife in Japan) study was to conduct a multidisciplinary study of health and well-being in a sample of middle- and older-aged Japanese adults.

For each strata a total of 100 samples are allotted and proportionally distributed among each ward based on the number of registered residents in the Basic Resident Register Book for Tokyo, as of March 31, 2007. Approximately ten samples were assigned per sampling spot. The primary sampling unit was based on the basic survey units fixed at the 2005 National Census. The sampling spots were sampled from a table of random numbers. Respondents for each sampling spot were selected from the Basic Resident Register Book using a systematic sampling method. Two reserve samples were allotted per respondent. If the primary selected respondent was ineligible, regardless of reason, the reserve samples were used. To ensure adequate sampling of men from the three youngest decades (30-39, 40-49, 50-59), three reserve samples were allotted per respondent. If sampling could not be conducted from the basic resident register book, samples were transferred to a different ward within the same area."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mail questionnaire"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The overall response rate was 56.2 percent.
