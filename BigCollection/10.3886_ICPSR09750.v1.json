Cuban (those arriving from the port of Mariel) or Haitian immigrants aged 18 to 60 who arrived in the United States in 1980 or after and settled in designated areas in South Florida were interviewed in 1983 and 1984, with a follow-up interview being conducted in 1986 and 1987. The first interview elicited background information on the two refugee samples and estab\nlished baseline data on their situations and attitudes shortly after their arrival in the United States. The follow-up interview was designed to gauge changes in respondents' socioeconomic situations, social relations, ethnic identities, and attitudes. Major demographic variables include marital status, number of children, education, present and prior occupations, date and community of birth, prior residency in the United States, and religious practices. Respondents were also asked about their r\neasons for coming to the United States, plans to change residency, perceptions of discrimination in the United States, and aspirations concerning future occupations, salary, education, and opportunities to reach their goals. The follow-up interview expanded upon or recorded changes in these areas and also added items on perception of problems in the United States, ethnicity of social relationships and neighborhood, satisfaction with living in the United States, plans to return to their homeland,\nlanguages spoken, read, and listened to, whether residence was owned or rented, and whether the respondent had become a United States citizen."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"acculturation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cultural identity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cultural perceptions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population migration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"refugees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social adjustment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"socioeconomic status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.A.
