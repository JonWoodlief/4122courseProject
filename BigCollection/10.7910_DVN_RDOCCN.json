Radiotherapy confers beneﬁts for local control and progression free survival (PFS) in patients with breast cancer.\r\nThis study aimed to assess PFS in patients treated by hypofractionated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and correlate PFS with patients' clinical and pathological profiles. \r\nMethods: We retrospectively reviewed 299 women with breast cancer treated at Baghdad Radiation Oncology Center between October 2017 and May 2018. Regarding radiotherapy, 4005 cGy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks was adopted as standard practice for patients undergoing mastectomy and 4005 cG in 15 fractions + 1000 cG in 5 fractions as a booster dose for women undergoing breast-conserving surgery. \r\nResults: Age ranged from 25 to 75 years, and the mean age was 49.9±10.99 years. The most common stage was T2 (156, 53.9%), which mostly comprised luminal A (105, 36.3%). The results showed a high frequency of N1 (109, 37.2%), with luminal A (69, 23.4%). Relapse occurred in 35/299 (11.7%) patients, and the chest wall was a common relapse site in 9 of these patients (25.9%). \r\nConclusions: We conclude that adjuvant radiotherapy reduce locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis and mortality rate. \r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-12-21"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alnaqqash, Manwar"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-12-21"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Progression free survival in Iraqi breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant 3D conformal radiotherapy: A cross-sectional study","label":"Excel sheet file of 299 Iraqi breast cancer women.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":148740,"dataFile":{"id":3333822,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RDOCCN/UAZUUV","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RDOCCN/UAZUUV","filename":"Excel sheet file of 299 Iraqi breast cancer women.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":988,"description":"Progression free survival in Iraqi breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant 3D conformal radiotherapy: A cross-sectional study","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:167d1d6bbfb-8d57e3bd5920","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:FZF8NcImteo/gwrsgBbGFQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"35271628f901ce7b3d1b4be249f3cc4e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"35271628f901ce7b3d1b4be249f3cc4e"}}}]}}}
