Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, Texas governor George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, Michigan senator Spencer Abraham, Michigan representative Debbie Stabenow, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Regarding the upcoming presidential election, respondents were asked how much attention they were paying to the campaign, for whom they would vote, and whether that decision was firm. They were also asked which of the two candidates, Bush or Gore, cared more about people like the respondent, whether the two candidates had strong qualities of leadership, and whether the candidates shared the moral values of most Americans. Opinions were gathered from respondents on whether the candidates spent more time attacking each other or explaining what they would do as president, and whether these attacks seemed unfair. Respondents were also asked if the budget surplus should be used to pay down the national debt, cut income taxes, or preserve programs such as Social Security and Medicare, how important reducing costs of prescription drugs for the elderly was, how they felt about trade and tuition vouchers, and which presidential candidate's views on these issues most closely resembled their own. Opinions were elicited on whether Gore or Bush, if elected, would improve the economy, trade, health care, education, prescription drugs for the elderly, and the environment, and if they would reduce taxes. In regard to presidential campaign commercials for the November 2000 election, respondents were asked if they had seen any campaign commercials, whether these ads showed what the candidates stood for or if they attacked their opponent, and whether these ads made respondents feel better or worse about Bush or Gore. Wi\nth respect to the upcoming Senate race, respondents were asked which candidate they were most likely to vote for and whether that decision was firm, if Abraham and Stabenow had spent more time attacking each other or explaining what they would do as senator, and whether these attacks seemed unfair. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, voter registration and participation history, political party, political orientation, membership in a union, Hispanic descent, marital status, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George
