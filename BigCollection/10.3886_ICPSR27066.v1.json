This study is comprised of two parts: Part 1, Public Use Survey Data, and Part 2, Public Use Smoking Supplement Data. Part 1 contains questions regarding general health status, mental health, health care access, cardiovascular health, diabetes, asthma, immunizations, nutrition, physical activity, HIV, and sexual behavior. Part 2 focuses on smoking habits of respondents, second hand smoke exposure, and alcohol consumption. Interviews were completed in English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), as well as multiple other languages, according to the preference of the respondent. The interviews were conducted by Baruch Survey Research Unit between April 10 and August 22, 2003. The sample was geo-stratified to collect interviews from 42 United Hospital Fund (UHF) areas in New York City. Weights were constructed at the UHF-level to allow the sample to provide neighborhood-level estimations of both individual adults and of households in New York City. The margin of sampling error for the complete set of weighted data is +/-1.44 percent for citywide household estimations, and +/-1.56 percent for citywide individual-level estimations. A core group of demographic variables are included to facilitate weighting and comparisons among different groups of New Yorkers. These demographic variables include gender, age, marital status, employment status, race, income, and educational attainment."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"n/a"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The telephone sample was provided by MSG-Genesys, Inc. according to Baruch's specifications.

The design uses random-digit dialing (RDD) methods. The telephone sample was provided by MSG-Genesys, Inc. according to Baruch's specifications. The sample was drawn using standard list-assisted random-digit dialing methodology. Every active block of telephone numbers (area code + exchange + two-digit block number) that contained one or more residential directory listings was equally likely to be selected. This method guarantees coverage of every assigned phone number regardless of whether that number is directory listed, unlisted, or too new to be listed. After selection, numbers were compared against business directories and matching numbers were purged. Additionally, randomly generated numbers that were not listed households were then dialed by MSG using their ID-Plus system, to remove businesses and nonworking numbers. Strata sizes were established for each of the 42 UHF district. Once a UHF reached the target, all unresolved telephone numbers with exchanges that were at least 90 percent likely to be in a completed UHF were automatically statused as \"over quota\", as these numbers were extremely likely to fall in strata that were completed. (While RDD sample includes a predicted ZIP code based on the relationship between telephone exchange and ZIP codes for listed numbers, the predicted ZIP codes match reported ZIP codes less than half the time. Therefore, exchange and ZIP code data from actual completes were used to guide the suppression of numbers.)"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>Individual Weighting Formula</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The initial weighting scheme was based on the following: Number of adults in HH/Residential lines in HH (limit of 2) x Telephone noncoverage factor</li>\n<li>The UHF Population factor = Adult population (UHF or ZIP code)/Sum of probabilities of adult selection</li>\n<li>The Final weight was based Raking factors x Probability of adult selection x Population factors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Household Weighting Formula</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Individual weighting scheme was based on the following: Number of adults in HH (capped at 3)</li>\n<li>The UHF Household factor: Number of households with adults 18+ Adult population/Sum of probabilities of household selection</li>\n<li>The Final weight was based on Raking factors x Initial weighting x Household factors</li>\n</ul>"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Performed consistency checks."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Based on the final dispositions of numbers dialed for the survey, Response Rate 3 is 44 percent and Cooperation Rate 1 is 58 percent."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Public Use Data ","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":40605,"dataFile":{"id":2655212,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Public Use Data ","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Public Use Smoking Supplement Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":40605,"dataFile":{"id":2655213,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Public Use Smoking Supplement Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
