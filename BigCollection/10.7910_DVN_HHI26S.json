To develop a new predictive scoring system, backward stepwise elimination and a z-score-based scoring scheme were used based on logistic regression analyses. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method was used for validation.\r\nResults: Ninety-five patients (34.7%) survived until discharge. Of these, 78 patients (28.5%) had good neurological outcomes (CPC scores of 1 or 2). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant predictors of poor neurological outcome included age>65 years, initial Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score>13 points, first monitored arrest rhythm, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) pump-on time>30 min, initial pulse pressure<25 mmHg, initial mean arterial pressure<70 mmHg, and serum glucose level>300 mg/dL. There was also a significant interaction between age and CPR to ECMO pump-on time. The newly developed neurological outcome score after ECPR (nECPR) more effectively predicted poor neurological outcome (C-statistic 0.867, 95% confidence interval 0.823-0.912) than the former ECPR score (P = .019 for nECPR vs. ECPR) and the survival after veno-arterial ECMO (SAVE) score (P < .001 for nECPR vs. SAVE). LOOCV analysis confirmed the low misclassification rate of the nECPR score compared with ECPR and SAVE scores (13% vs. 22% and 38%, respectively).\r\nConclusions: The nECPR score can better predict early neurological prognosis in patients who undergo ECPR than currently used methods."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ryu, Jeong-Am"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-11-14"}]}},"files":[{"label":"ECPR neurologic outcome Harvard Dataverse Network.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":130531,"dataFile":{"id":3075533,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/HHI26S/28U0UD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HHI26S/28U0UD","filename":"ECPR neurologic outcome Harvard Dataverse Network.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":138470,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15fbaceb1b9-165d049561a8","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"55ec2311d481db4a422aaf54d23579b1","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"55ec2311d481db4a422aaf54d23579b1"}}}]}}}
