The survey uses political party affiliations and the job titles of public officials to see how the inclusion or absence of these details affects how citizens blame certain individuals. The survey was conducted by Knowledge Networks (KN) over the Internet in May 2006, using a nationally representative sample of 397 American adults.

The major variables in this study can be divided into four groups; demographics, blame, attitude/emotions, and knowledge. The blame variables ranks seven local and federal government officials, the attitude/emotion variables measure anger and grief levels, and the knowledge variables measure the respondent’s general knowledge of Hurricane Katrina and its effects."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hurricanes"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"natural disaster"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preparedness"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preparedness"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Malhotra, N., & Kuo, A.

Conducting a survey experiment exploring people’s opinions on the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina offers a remarkably clean test of the sources of blame attribution. The survey was conducted by Knowledge Networks (KN) over the Internet in May 2006, using a nationally representative sample of 397 American adults. KN recruits panel members over the telephone via random digit dialing (RDD) and provides them with WebTV equipment in exchange for their participation in weekly surveys, which they complete online. All Americans were sampled from the KN panel, not simply those directly affected by Hurricane Katrina, because the entire nation formed judgments about the competence of the government officials involved. In the survey, respondents were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, which differ along two dimensions with respect to the information contained in the response options: whether each public official in the ranking list is associated with his/her office title, and whether the official is given a party affiliation. These two dimensions constitute the four experimental groups. The control group only received the list of seven proper names without any additional information. Group 2, the “party cues” condition, received the list of proper names with each official’s partisan affiliation. Group 3, the “office cues” condition, received the list of proper names with each official’s job title. Group 4, the “both cues” condition, received the list of proper names with each official’s partisan affiliation and job title. For all respondents, the order of the officials on each list of officials was randomized."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"web-based interview"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Seven post-stratification weights are incorporated into this study. The first is half-sampling of telephone numbers for which no address could be found. The second is RDD sampling rates proportional to the number of phone lines in the household. The third is minor oversampling of Chicago and Los Angeles due to early pilot surveys in these two cities. The fourth is short-term double-sampling of the four largest states (CA, NY, FL, and TX) and central region states. The fifth is under-sampling of households not covered by MSN TV. The sixth is oversampling of minority households (Black and Hispanic). Finally, the seventh weight is the selection of one adult per household. In order to calculate final weights, the researchers derived weighted sample distributions along various combinations of five variables. The first is gender (male, female). The second is age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 and over). The third is race/ethnicity (White, Black, other, Hispanic). The fourth is region (northeast, Midwest, south, west). Finally, the fifth variable is education (highest level achieved: less than high school, high school, some college, college degree or more). Similar distributions are calculated using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data and the KN panel data. Cell-by-cell adjustments over the various univariate and bivariate distributions are calculated to make the weighted sample cells match those of the U.S. Census and the KN panel."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The response rate was 68.0% (397 out of 584)."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Katrina_Blame_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43283,"dataFile":{"id":2300959,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Katrina_Blame_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":411560,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69763","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7ccc9ed5b864f7ee61483ef960055ebe","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7ccc9ed5b864f7ee61483ef960055ebe"}}},{"description":"","label":"Katrina_Blame_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43283,"dataFile":{"id":2300956,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Katrina_Blame_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":87944,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69758","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","originalFileSize":71019,"UNF":"UNF:5:ZSj1jhL9fEcP6Dsgcx2F0w==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"81ca7f6d53d0d4aac645ebe9f18dbb6a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"81ca7f6d53d0d4aac645ebe9f18dbb6a"}}},{"description":"","label":"Katrina_Blame_Questionnaire.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43283,"dataFile":{"id":2300955,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Katrina_Blame_Questionnaire.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":90944,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69760","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"16a242655d4b1956f69c3d48d4d144d2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"16a242655d4b1956f69c3d48d4d144d2"}}}]}}}
