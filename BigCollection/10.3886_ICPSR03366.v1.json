The project  was organized around the following research objectives: (1)  identification of the nature, extent, and underlying causes of CSE and  the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) occurring in the  United States, (2) identification of those subgroups of children that  were at the greatest risk of being sexually exploited, (3)  identification of subgroups of adult perpetrators of sex crimes  against children, and (4) identification of the modes of operation and  other methods used by organized criminal units to recruit children  into sexually exploitative activities. The study involved surveying  senior staff members of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and  government organizations (GOs) in the United States known to be  dealing with persons involved in the transnational trafficking of  children for sexual purposes. Part 1 consists of survey data from  nongovernment organizations. These were local child and family  agencies serving runaway and homeless youth. Part 2 consists of survey  data from government organizations. These organizations were divided  into local, state, and federal agencies. Local organizations included  municipal law enforcement, county law enforcement, prosecutors, public  defenders, and corrections. State organizations included state child  welfare directors, prosecutors, and public defenders. Federal  organizations included the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal  Public Defenders, Immigration and Naturalization Service, United  States Attorneys, United States Customs, and the United States Postal  Service. Variables in Parts 1 and 2 include the organization's city,  state, and ZIP code, the type of services provided or type of law  enforcement agency, how the agency was funded, the scope of the  agency's service area, how much emphasis was placed on CSEC as a  policy issue or a service issue, conditions that might influence the  number of CSEC cases, how staff were trained to deal wi\nth CSEC cases,  how victims were identified, the number of children that experienced  child abuse, sexual abuse, pornography, or other exploitation in 1999  and 2000 by age and gender, methods of recruitment, family history of victims, gang involvement, and substance abuse history of victims."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The benefits of economic globalization,  internationalization, and free trade have brought with them an  unanticipated set of social problems.
