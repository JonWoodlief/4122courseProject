Respondents were asked to evaluate   President Bill Clinton's handling of foreign policy, the economy, and   health care reform. The poll also queried respondents regarding the   most important problem facing the country, the performance of Congress   and the representative in Congress from their district, and the effect   of trade with other countries on the United States economy. Clinton's   health care reform plan and the North American Free Trade Agreement   (NAFTA) formed the emphasis of this survey, with attention also given   to public opinion of Hillary Clinton, Ross Perot, Al Gore, and Bob   Dole. Background information on respondents includes employment   background, voter registration status, household composition, vote   choice in the 1992 presidential election, political party, political   orientation, education, age, sex, r\nace, Hispanic origin, religious  preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
