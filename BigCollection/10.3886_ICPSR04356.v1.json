The study  examined the use of several jury reform techniques using a controlled  mock jury approach in which mock juries composed of jury pool members  watched a videotaped armed robbery trial featuring conflicting expert  testimony about mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evidence. A total of 480  mock jurors were randomly assigned to eight-person juries and to one  of the six conditions in the experiment. Ten mock juries were run in  each of the six conditions (No Innovations, Note Taking, Question  Asking and Note Taking, DNA Checklist and Note Taking, Jury Notebook  and Note Taking, and All Innovations). At various points throughout  the study (before the trial, after watching the videotaped trial, and  after reaching a verdict), mock jurors were asked to complete  questionnaires to gauge their understanding of mtDNA and the mtDNA  evidence presented during the trial. They were also asked if and how  the use of the jury trial innovations helped in their understanding of  the mtDNA evidence. Specific variables contained in the study include  demographic variables of the mock jurors, including their math and  science background, mock jurors' views of science, their understanding  of mtDNA, their perceptions of the reliability of different types of  evidence, and the credibility of the prosecutor, defense attorney,  detective, eyewitness, defendant, and expert witnesses, and whether the mock jurors favor or oppose the various innovations."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this study was to test whether the  use of selected jury trial reforms enhanced jurors' understanding of  complex and challenging scientific evidence presented during a  criminal trial.

It was the first study of forensic evidence involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rather than nuclear DNA (nDNA)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In this experimental research study, 480 mock  jurors were randomly assigned to eight-person juries and to one of the  six conditions in the experiment. Ten mock juries were run in each of  the following six conditions: Condition 1 -- No Innovations (Control),  Condition 2 -- Note Taking (Control), Condition 3 -- Question Asking and  Note Taking, Condition 4 -- DNA Checklist and Note Taking, Condition 5  -- Jury Notebook and Note Taking, and Condition 6 -- All Innovations  (Note Taking, Question Asking, DNA Checklist, and Notebook). The  checklist (Conditions 4 and 6) listed the principal questions about  the mtDNA in the case, but left it for the jurors to fill in the  answers. The notebook (Conditions 5 and 6) included background  materials on the mtDNA issues. At the beginning of the study,  demographic and background information were collected from the mock  jurors as well as the participants' attitudes toward science in  general and DNA evidence in particular. Then all 60 juries watched the  same videotaped armed robbery trial. Rather than construct a mtDNA  case from scratch, the mock trial was based on the issues, fact  pattern, and transcripts of testimony from an actual trial, State  v. Pappas. The nonscientific factual evidence was modified so that it  was more ambiguous, making the mtDNA evidence more crucial to the  jury's decision. The trial lasted 70 minutes, including one ten-minute  break. In the two con\nditions in which questions for the experts were  permitted (Conditions 3 and 6), the judge in the videotaped trial  instructed the jurors on the procedure for asking questions of the  expert witnesses. The research assistants repeated the instructions  and invited questions after each of the scientific experts testified.  If a juror had a question, he or she wrote the question on a sheet of  note paper and turned it in to the research assistant. Judge Dann  ruled on the admissibility of all questions. If the question was ruled  admissible, Judge Dann or Professor Hans then called one of the DNA  experts who had previously agreed to field calls and obtained a verbal  response to the question. Judge Dann or Professor Hans wrote down the  response verbatim and returned it to the jury at the next opportunity.  Following the trial, but before jury deliberations, the mock jurors  were asked to complete a second questionnaire that asked questions  about the mtDNA and their use of and attitudes toward the jury  reforms. There was a specific questionnaire for each condition, as  items about the individual reforms differed from condition to  condition. Once the mock jury had reached a unanimous verdict or had a  mistrial declared because of a hung jury, all participants completed a  third questionnaire. The mock jurors were asked about their reaction  to the jury's verdict, their own individual views, mtDNA questions,  and support for different jury reforms. A set of questions was added  to this final questionnaire after a highly publicized mtDNA  evidentiary hearing that occurred during the study, to determine participants' exposure to the hearing and any impact it may have had."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables found in this study include demographic  variables of the mock jurors, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity,  level of education, number of math and science courses taken in high  school and college, job experience in math or science, current job  status, job category, political views, household income, and if the  mock jurors had ever served on a jury for a criminal or civil  case. They were also asked questions to judge their knowledge and  understanding of mtDNA and the mtDNA evidence presented in the trial,  as well as question about their general views of science. Mock jurors  were asked to rate the reliability of police evidence, victim  evidence, expert evidence, DNA evidence, and eyewitness evidence. They  were also asked to rate the credibility and believability of the  prosecutor, eyewitness, detective, the prosecutor's expert witness,  defense attorney, the defense attorney's expert witness, and the  defendant. Mock jurors were asked whether or not they used the  innovations available to them in their specific condition and why they  had decided to use the innovation or not. Finally, the mock jurors  were asked whether they favor or opposed the use of each innovation,  regardless if it had been available for their personal use in the study."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"courtroom proceedings"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DNA fingerprinting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"jury deliberations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"jury instructions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trial procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XII.
