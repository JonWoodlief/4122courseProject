Applying multiple correspondence analysis to the 1984 Canadian National Election Study, we will discuss a method which allows to test a set of items for measurement effects such as ordinality and response sets. In the given example, ordinality of the political efficacy and trust items could be confirmed only for politically interested respondents. For respondents with low political interest, there is clear evidence of a response set resulting in a tendency to “strongly agree” regardless of the direction of the items. Taken together, these findings call into question the substantive relationships reported in the literature."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2000"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jörg Blasius and Victor Thiessen. 2000. \"Methodological Artifacts in Measures of Political Efficacy and Trust: A Multiple Correspondence Analysis.\"  Political Analysis, 9(1), 1-20. <a href= \"http://polmeth.wustl.edu/analysis/vol/9/PA91-1-20.pdf\" target= \"_new\">article available here</a>"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Political Analysis"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2000"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Murray Research Archive"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://murray.harvard.edu"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://murray.harvard.edu/files/murray/banner146x48.png"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Published Article","label":"MethodologicalArtifacts.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":44039,"categories":["1.
