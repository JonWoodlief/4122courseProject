In particular, the researchers explored three key aspects  of offenders' criminal careers: participation, frequency of offending,  and termination rates from active offending. The study focused on  differences in levels of serious offending by drug-using and nonusing  drug offenders compared to drug-using and nonusing predatory  offenders. Longitudinal arrest data for a sample of arrestees were  collected to characterize the offending patterns of drug-using and  nonusing drug offenders and predatory offenders. The sample was drawn  from adults arrested in Washington, DC, on any charge from July 1,  1985, to June 30, 1986. Data were collected from case files maintained  by the Washington, DC, Pretrial Services Agency for 883 arrestees and  5,387 arrests. Previous and subsequent arrests of the same individual  were linked to form an arrest history. Within the sample of arrestees,  three main types of offenders were distinguished based on offense  charge at target arrest: (1) drug offenders, (2) predatory offenders  (persons charged with robbery or burglary), and (3) all others. This  study focused on the first two groups and distinguished drug users  from non-users based on the results of a urine drug screen  administered following the target arrest. Variables regarding arrests  include date of arrest, drug test result, charges filed, disposition  date, disposition type, and sentence length imposed. Demographic variables include race, sex, and place of birth."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Growing public concern about the spread of  illicit drug use spawned a variety of efforts in the 1980s to increase  the severity of sentences imposed on convicted drug offenders. These  increases in sanctions were also motivated by related concerns about  reducing the predatory crimes, especially robbery and burglary, often  associated with drug use. While it was commonly believed that crime  control policies directed at drug offenders would be effective in  reducing predatory crimes, these policies ignored the potential  complexity of the relationships among drug use, drug trafficking, and  predatory crimes. In particular, rather than serving as an indicator  of high levels of predatory crime, drug trafficking may represent an  alternative to predatory crime for many drug users. This study  examined differences in criminal career parameters that determine the  potential incapacitative effects of alternative sentencing policies  directed at drug-involved offenders. In particular, the researchers  explored three key aspects of offenders' criminal careers:  participation, frequency of offending, and termination rates from  active offending.

Record Type 1, comprised of 13 variables and 883  records, contains stable personal information. Each unique individual  represented in the data has a single Record Type 1. Record Type 2,  comprised of 49 variables and 5,387 records, contains changing  personal information at the time of arrest. Record Type 3, comprised  of 78 variables and 5,387 records, contains arrest and court  information. Each occurrence of Record Type 1 has at least one  associated Record Type 2. Each occurrence of Record Type 2 has exactly  one associated Record Type 3. (2) The user guide and codebook are  provided as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
