This survey, fielded September 21, 1998,  is a call-back of the September 19-20, 1998, cohort (CBS NEWS MONTHLY  POLL #3, SEPTEMBER 1998 [ICPSR #2609]), and was conducted to assess  respondent views following the public release of the videotape of  President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony. Respondents were asked  to give their opinions of President Clinton, the United States  Congress, and the videotaped testimony that was released earlier in  the day. Those queried were asked how much of the videotape they had  seen, what stood out, whether Clinton was sufficiently cooperative,  whether the questions asked by the lawyers were appropriate, and what  the motivations were behind the posing of detailed questions about  Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky. A series of questions  addressed the release of the videotaped testimony. Topics covered  whether the release of the tape by the House Judiciary Committee was  necessary, whether it was appropriate for major news organizations to  broadcast the entire tape, and\nwhether the video was more or less  damaging than expected. Respondents were asked whether they believed  that Clinton perjured himself before the grand jury and, if so, how he  should be punished. Those queried were also asked whether the  Judiciary Committee should hold hearings to determine if Clinton  should be impeached. Background information on respondents includes  age, race, ethnicity, sex, education, religion, political party,  political orientation, voter registration and participation history,  marital status, employment status, family income, and age of children in household."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
