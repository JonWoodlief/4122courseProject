In each state, offenders who participated in boot  camps were compared with demographically similar offenders who were  sentenced to prison, probation, or parole. The impact of shock  incarceration on offenders was assessed in two major areas: (1)  changes in offenders' attitudes, expectations, and outlook during  incarceration (self-report/attitude data), and (2) performance during  and adjustment to community supervision after incarceration (community  supervision data). The self-report/attitude data include variables  measuring criminal history, drinking and drug abuse, and attitudes  toward the shock incarceration program, as well as demographic  variables, such as age, race, employment, income, education, and  military experience. The community supervision data contain  information on offenders' behaviors during community supervision, such  as arrests, absconding incidents, jail time, drug use, education and  employment experiences, financial and residential stability, and  contacts with community supervision officers, along with  demographic variables, such as age and race. In addition to these key  areas, more detailed data were collected in Louisiana, including a  psychological assessment, a risk and needs assessment, and a community  supervision follow-up at two different time periods (Parts 11-18). For  most states, the subjects sampled in the self-report/attitude survey  were different from those who were surveyed in the community  supervision phase of data collection. Data collection practices and  sample structures differed by state, and therefore the data files are  organized to explore the impact of shock incarceration at the state level.

Self-report/attitude data are available for five  states (Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and South Carolina). In  each state, a sample of shock incarceration inmates was compared to a  sample of traditional prison inmates during incarceration. Subjects in  both samples completed a self-report questionnaire twice in a repeated  measure design. The first questionnaire was completed early in their  incarceration and the second was administered approximately 90 days  later, except in Louisiana where the survey was administered at three  points in time. The questionnaire consisted of personal history and  attitude items. Demographic data were also collected on each subject  from official records. Community supervision data, which are available  for all seven states, were compiled to compare three samples of  offenders: (1) shock incarceration graduates, (2) offenders on  probation or parole, and (3) shock incarceration dropouts. In most  states, data were collected at three-month intervals for one year. In  Oklahoma, data were collected at two time periods. Offenders in Texas  were followed for two years. In Louisiana, subjects were evaluated  after one year and again after two years. For most states, the  subjects sampled in the self-report/attitude survey were different  from those who were surveyed in the community supervision of data  collection. Data collection practices and sample structures differed  by state, and therefore the data files are organized to explore the impact  of shock incarceration at the state level. For each state, the unit of analysis is the shock or comparison group offender."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The self-report/attitude data files measure  offender comparison and change during incarceration. The same core  questionnaire was used in Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, and South  Carolina. Variables in these files include type of crime committed,  prior arrests and convictions, juvenile delinquency, drinking and drug  use, attitudes toward the shock program, asocial attitudes, and  demographic information, such as age, race, employment, income,  education, and military experience. The South Carolina file also has a  sex variable, since the sample includes both men and women. The other  data files measure offender adjustment to community supervision. The  same core questionnaire was used in Florida, Georgia, and South  Carolina. Variables in these files include type of crime committed,  prior arrests and convictions, and demographic information, such as  age and race. In addition, information about offenders' behaviors  during community supervision was recorded, including arrests,  absconding incidents, jail time, pending violations, revocations, drug  use, educational and employment experiences, financial and residential  stability, overall progress in the program, and number and types of  contacts with community supervision officers. The South Carolina file  contains an additional variable, age at first arrest. The Georgia  file contains additional variables from a two-year follow-up that  measure arrests, revocations, abscondings, and legal releases. The  Louisiana files contain more detailed information than the other state  files (Parts 11-18). In addition to simi\nlar self-report and community  supervision variables, the Louisiana data provide other  attitude and psychological variables. These include the Jessness  personality inventory, attitudes toward shock incarceration, locus of  control, perceived control of events, coping methods, state-trait anxiety, assertive interactions, and conflicts in prison."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parole"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prison inmates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"shock incarceration programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
