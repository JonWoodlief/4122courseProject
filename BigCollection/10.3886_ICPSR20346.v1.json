The study also sought to  understand the goals that courts, batterer programs, and victim  assistance agencies currently ascribe to batterer programs. The  study's focus was on the systemic response to noncompliance with a  court order to a batterer program, rather than the success of batterer  programs in preventing recidivism among program completers. The study  was motivated by five main questions: (1) Rationale: Why do criminal  courts use batterer programs?, (2) policies and practices regarding  court mandates to batterer programs: How do criminal courts use  batterer programs?, (3) Policies and practices regrading enforcement  of mandates: Do criminal courts enforce their mandates to batterer  programs by imposing jail or other sanctions in response to  noncompliance?, (4) Cross-agency consistency: Within communities, are  the perceptions of batterer programs, criminal courts and victim  assistance agencies in alignment?, and (5) Impact of contextual  characteristics: Does the use and enforcement of batterer program  mandates vary? Additional questions included: when and how courts  mandate offenders to these programs, what, if any, other types of  programs courts mandate for domestic violence offenders (e.g., alcohol  treatment, mental health treatment, or parenting), and to what extent  courts, batterer programs, and victim assistance agencies concur on their answers to these questions."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In order to explore the extent to which criminal  courts use batterer programs to hold domestic violence offenders  accountable, a preliminary survey was sent to all identified batterer  programs. Surveys were mailed to 2,445 sites with self-addressed  return envelopes in March 2005. The survey was only one page, and was  printed on the back of a brief cover letter stating the study's  purpose in general terms and providing assurances of confidentiality.  The focus of the preliminary survey was to maximize the number of  responding programs, to obtain contact information on criminal courts  and victim assistance agencies, and to gain basic information that  would inform the sampling process. In May 2006, a survey of 260  communities nationwide was implemented. Within each community, a  batterer program, criminal court, and victim assistance agency was  surveyed. All the programs, courts, and agencies selected for the  community survey were sent a letter that stated its purpose, asked  them to complete the survey online, provided a unique online username  and password, and described confidentiality and data security  protocols approved by the Center for Court Innovation. (The online  format enabled the researchers to program automatic skip-patterns, so  that each respondent would only see those questions requiring an  answer based upon previous responses.) The letter also provided  contact information for respondents who wished to receive and complete  a hard copy of the survey. After five weeks, a reminder postcard was  sent to nonresponders. Ten weeks later, hard copies of the survey were  sent to nonresponders. Simultaneously, the researchers used intensive  phone and e-mail follow-ups with those nonresponders for whom there  was no accurate contact information. Finally, the director of the  National Institute of Justice signed a letter that was sent to all  remaining nonresponders (with survey attached) indicating the importance of the study and requesting their participation."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"All respondents were asked to define their  community as primarily urban, suburban, or rural. Furthermore, all  respondents were asked the same questions concerning the function of  court mandates to batterer programs: treatment/rehabilitation,  monitoring, accountability, legally appropriate punishment,  alternative to incarceration, or other. All respondents were asked how  courts respond to noncompliance. Courts and batterer programs were  asked how often the court imposed sanctions in response to  noncompliance, how often the court imposed each of eight specific  sanctions, and whether the court responded consistently to reports of  noncompliance. Victim assistance agencies were asked how often the  court imposed sanctions and whether the court responded consistently  to reports of program noncompliance. Both courts and batterer programs  were asked whether state laws, regulations, or standards existed  governing the use of the batterer programs and whether batterer  programs were certified by the state. Courts and batterer programs  were asked how they interact. Questions on the batterer program survey  included whether, when, and to whom in the criminal justice system the  program reported on compliance. The court survey included questions on  whether the court received progress reports from the batterer program,  and if so, when and who received them. Courts were asked why they used  batterer programs. Specific questions asked included: what types of  charges lead to batterer program mandates, when these mandates are  imposed (pre- and/or postdisposition), whether and how probation is  included, approximately how many defendants were mandated per month,  whether the court was aware of the specific program in which each  defendant enrolls, and which other types of program mandates the court  sometimes imposed on domestic violence offenders (alcohol treatment,  subs\ntance abuse treatment, mental health treatment or parenting  classes) instead of a mandate to a batterer program. Batterer programs  were asked whether the program accepted court-mandated referrals only  or if they accepted voluntary referrals as well, the length and  duration of the program, possible reasons for noncompliance, the  approximate program completion rate, and primary focus of their  curriculum. Victim assistance agencies were asked what they thought  the primary focus of the batterer program curriculum should be:  addressing participant mental health issues, confronting attitudes  towards intimate partners, educating participants about domestic  violence, holding participants accountable, or teaching communication and coping skills."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family violence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivists"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

Approximately 70  percent were identified with the help of state domestic violence  coalitions, over 25 percent were found through Internet searches, and  approximately 3 percent came through informal contacts made by an  advisory board and co-principal investigator. The sampling approach  did not call for a representative sample of all batterer programs or  criminal courts nationwide. Rather, a sample was sought that provided  a mix of community types (small, medium, and large, and urban,  suburban, and rural) but was geographically comprehensive,  representing every state and region, including those with smaller  populations. Researchers also sought to over-represent communities  known to deal with high numbers of batterer program mandates relative  to their populations, in order to avoid skewing the final sample  toward the experiences of batterer programs and courts that process a  low number of cases per year. When the preliminary survey was  conducted of these programs, 149 letters were returned addressee  unknown, and it was discovered that 30 of the agencies were not  actually batterer programs. A population of 2,265 batterer programs  remained. The final sample selection process involved reviewing the  responses to the preliminary survey one state at a time. Selection in  each state was driven by the following preference rules: (1) if the  batterer program referrals originated with the criminal court, (2) if  the responding batterer program was able to identify a local victim  assistance agency, (3) whether the responding batterer program  received both pre- and postdisposition batterer program referrals, (4)  the size of the relative volume of cases received, (5) population  density, and (6) a limit of three to five communities per state. The  sampling process led to selection of 260 communities, or triads. This  sample included 48 percent of the 543 batterer programs that responded  to the preliminary survey. In 28 percent of the communities in the  final sample, the batterer program and victim assistance agencies were  one and the same. The final sample comprised three to five communities  in 24 states (48 percent), more than five in 18 states (36 percent),  and less than three in eight states (16 percent).
