In the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1989,  many prison admissions resulted from arrests and convictions in which  the primary offense was a drug charge. At the same time, Florida's  Control Release Authority, in its efforts to manage the size of the  inmate population, was granting early release to drug offenders wh\no  were considered to be low risk. It was observed, however, that some of  these releases were readmitted to prison three or four times in the  course of a year. The Community Corrections Partnership Act of 1991  was passed with the intention of revising and rationalizing the  state's prison commitment policy, particularly in light of the crack  cocaine epidemic. The act was aimed at providing funding for substance  abuse programs both within the community and within the prison  system. A court-imposed requirement of drug treatment was regarded as  a cost-effective option whereby a substantial fraction of  drug-involved but nonviolent offenders could be safely diverted from a  prison sentence to one of supervision in the community. The focus of  this study was to investigate the relationship, if any, between drug  treatment and success or failure of drug-involved offenders on  probation/community supervision. Moreover, the researchers sought to  evaluate the outcomes of drug-involved offenders admitted to (1)  secure residential drug treatment programs, (2) non-secure residential  drug treatment programs, (3) non-residential drug treatment programs, and (4) no drug treatment programs."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were collected from administrative records  provided by the Florida Department of Corrections, specifically case  history records of offenders admitted to supervision in the community  from July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1995. The data contain information  on offenders admitted to either a residential (secure or non-secure)  or non-residential drug treatment program, as well as those offenders  receiving no drug treatment. Residential programs involved a  structured, live-in, non-hospital environment, focusing on all aspects  of substance abuse rehabilitation, including ancillary services such  as vocation and education programs. A secure residential drug  treatment program was defined as a high-intensity residential  treatment program that limited access of the offender in and out of  the facility. This treatment program was 12 to 18 months in length,  and was considered appropriate for extreme substance abuse cases.  Part 1 is comprised of all cases admitted to community supervision  between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1993 (fiscal years 1991 and 1992)  and treated in a secure residential drug treatment program. Non-secure  residential drug treatment programs were defined as a six-month  medium-intensity residential program, which consisted of a two-month  intensive treatment component followed by a four-month employment  reentry component. Part 2 is comprised of all cases admitted to  community supervision from July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1995,  receiving treatment in a non-secure residential drug treatment  program. Throughout the state of Florida, there also existed a large  number of non-residential treatment programs that were made available  through contracts with local service providers. Non-residential  treatment was regarded as an intervention in the comprehensive  community-based substance abuse programs providing therapeutic  activities on a variety of intensity levels statewide (i.e., drug  education classes, outpatient treatment, intensive outpatient  treatment, and day or night treatment). Part 3 contains data on  offenders admitted to non-residential drug treatment programs, whose  community supervision admissions were between July 1, 1991, and June  30, 1993. Part 4 contains data on offenders admitted to  non-residential drug treatment programs, whose community supervision  admissions were between July 1, 1993, and June 30, 1995 (fiscal years  1993 and 1994). If the facility type was recorded as 0 or missing, the  case was assigned to a \"no treatment\" category. Within this category  cases were defined as being drug-involved and, presumably, candidates  for admission to drug treatment. Part 5 contains data on cases  admitted to community supervision between July 1, 1991, and June 30\n,  1993, who did not receive drug treatment of any kind. Cases admitted  to community supervision between July 1, 1993, and June 20, 1995,  receiving no drug treatment are contained in Part 6. Each supervision  admission record contains a history of subsequent court actions that  were complete through December 31, 1997. Failure on community  supervision was defined in terms of the occurrence of at least one of  the following events during a two-year observation period following  admission to a specified drug treatment program: (1) revocation of the  current probation sentence, (2) return to prison with or without  sentence revocation, (3) an addition to the current probation sentence  but without revocation, or (4) a new sentence to prison or probation after successful completion of the current sentence."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables for all parts include population  estimates, unemployment rates, population by age-specific categories,  violent and nonviolent index offenses, per capita personal income,  clearance rates, split sentence flag, primary offense disposition,  primary offense felony level, current commitment years supervised,  supervision type, whether current offense included a drug charge,  number of prior supervision terms, number of prior commitments,  reasons for failure, treatment facility code, number of drug  sale/traffic offenses, outcome of supervision period, and reasons for prison intake.
