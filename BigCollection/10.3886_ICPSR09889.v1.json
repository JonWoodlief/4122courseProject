Respondents were asked to identify the strongest economic power in the world from a list that included both Japan and the United States and to indicate their approval or disapproval of the way George Bush handled relations with Japan. They were also asked whether their impressions of Japan were favorable, how they would describe relations between the United States and Japan, and whether relations were getting better. The survey also solicited opinions on whether Japan was a reliable ally of the United States, whether Japan had gained respect as a result of the war in the Persian Gulf, and whether Japan had provided enough financial assistance for the Persian Gulf War. Concerning trade, respondents were asked whether Japan practiced fair trade with the United States and vice versa, how important rice as a trade issue was between Japan and the United States, and whether United States farmers should be able to export as much rice to Japan as they could sell there. Respondents were also asked if Japanese investment in the United States was a good thing for the United States, whether restrictions should be placed on Japanese investments in the United States, and whether Japan's current economic strength posed a threat to the United States. In addition, the survey posed questions pertaining to whether life was better in Japan or in the United States, whether Japanese or American workers worked harder, whether Japan or the United States was more to blame for the war between the two countries 50 years ago, whether the respondent looked unfavorably on Japan for having attacked Pearl Harbor, and if anti-Japanese feelings seemed to be on the rise in the United States. The survey also asked respondents to indicate their level of trust in various institutions of American society, including banks, the military, public schools, the courts, and the federal government, and to rate items such as the quality of available health care. Respondents were also asked to comment on whether they were satisfied with their current residence. Background information on respondents includes political alignment, education, age, race, employment status, income, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George H.W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cultural perceptions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"exports"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign aid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign investment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international trade"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trade relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trust in government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
