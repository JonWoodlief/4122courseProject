It was    designed to give users a thorough introduction to most of the    knowledge and skills needed to produce daily maps and spatial data    queries that uniformed officers and detectives find valuable for crime    prevention and enforcement. The tutorials can be used either for    self-learning or in a laboratory setting. The geographic information    system (GIS) and police data were supplied by the Rochester, New York,    Police Department. For each mapping software package, there are three    PDF tutorial workbooks and one WinZip archive containing sample data    and maps. Workbook 1 was designed for GIS users who want to learn how    to use a crime-mapping GIS and how to generate maps and data queries.    Workbook 2 was created to assist data preparers in processing police    data for use in a GIS. This includes address-matching of police    incidents to place them on pin maps and aggregating crime counts by    areas (like car beats) to produce area or choropleth maps. Workbook 3    was designed for map makers who want to learn how to construct useful    crime maps, given police data that have already been address-matched    and preprocessed by data preparers. It is estimated that the three    tutorials take approximately six hours to complete in total, including   exercises."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime mapping"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"geographic information systems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"instructional materials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIX.
