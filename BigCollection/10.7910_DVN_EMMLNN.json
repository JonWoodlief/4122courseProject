An additional sample of community leaders was also included.<br /><br />  Interviews with families were conducted in 1970-1971. Interviews ranged from 90 minutes to three hours. Selection prerequisites for participating families required that both parents be Japanese; families were still intact whereby some children were still living at home; socially and psychologically families were adaptive. For the sample as a whole, families were selected so that both nisei and sansei generations, as well as socioeconomic and educational levels, were adequately represented in the sample. Interviews explored four broad topics, relationship with spouse; parents and children; family and relatives; and family and community.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds analogue materials for this study: original record demographic data sheets; interview schedules; and notes for 99 of the original 104 families.
