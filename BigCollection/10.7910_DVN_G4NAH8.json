Nevertheless, due to the connected near to the ground acceptance rate, its full potential in deepening and extending banking services is yet to be realised, as a decisive group of customers is yet to be accessed. As a result, a improved thoughtful of why some banking customers agree to IB and others do not, along side a recognition of the factors influencing this choice is expected to be of significant realistic as well as intellectual value. For this ground, the rationale of this learning was to explore the factors influencing the approval and practice patterns of IB among Bangladeshi customers. Using Rogersâ€™ IDT structure, data was composed by means of a self-completion questionnaire, in which some 249 banking clients participated. Findings propose perceptions of risk, lack of adequate support and training from banking institutions are some of the causes of non-usage. The implications of these conclusions are that banks possibly will centre extra concentration on cross-selling IB mutually with other financial commodities, as IB is hardly ever used in remoteness. Installing individual computers surrounded by branches in combination with campaigns and demonstrations might also get better rates of approval."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Engineering"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Internet banking"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Isolated banking"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Retail economic services"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ahmed, Dr. Alim Al Ayub"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Bangladesh"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"research article"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Volume 1, Issue 2/2013","label":"Internet Banking Espousal in Bangladesh_A Probing Study","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":96668,"dataFile":{"id":2964110,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/G4NAH8/BQQFSB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/G4NAH8/BQQFSB","filename":"Internet Banking Espousal in Bangladesh_A Probing Study","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":624096,"description":"Volume 1, Issue 2/2013","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:158edee4d8d-edb50c9a14ec","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4b026b38f4bf8a78d3816e183411cbec","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4b026b38f4bf8a78d3816e183411cbec"}}}]}}}
