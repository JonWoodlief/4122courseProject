The Pretrial  Diversion Program in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, targeted offenders  with limited arrest histories of nonviolent felony or misdemeanor  violations. The majority of eligible participants were violators of  simple drug possession statutes, primarily crack/cocaine or  marijuana. Persons charged with drug distribution offenses were not  eligible. In order to qualify for diversion, persons had to admit  guilt regarding the acts for which they were arrested. The program  was entirely voluntary. One of the unique aspects of this program  was its aggressive use of drug testing, including urinalysis and hair  analysis. This project evaluated the ability of the IMS to provide  complete drug profile information to supervising agencies and  assessed its usefulness to field staff engaged in drug monitoring  duties. The project was based on the premise that enhanced  information on offenders diverted into this program could create or  improve several key aspects of program operation, such as client  assessment, monitoring of compliance and progress, dispositional  decision-making, client motivation, and staff morale. The study was  designed to integrate the IMS into the normal operation of the New  Orleans Pretrial Diversion Program with as little modification of  existing treatment and supervision protocols as possible. Each client  in the diversion program underwent an intensive intake assessment  including an intake radioimmunoassay (RIA) hair assay and an  additional RIA hair assay every 60 days. Each client was urine-tested  at intake and assigned to a random test pool. The modified protocol  for the project added an IMS-based scan or a hair specimen, skin  wipe, and ten-second vacuum scan of clothing, hands, and axillae at  intake. At each subsequent visit each client had a repeat IMS scan  utilizing a skin swab and a scan of clothing or body area. Variables  include self-reported cocaine use, self-reported marijuana use, IMS  date, urinalysis date, hair assay results, urinalysis results, IMS  detection, nicotine use, maximum amplitude, delta, cumulative  amplitude, number of detections, whether the IMS showed a positive result, and the age, sex, and race of the client."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This project was designed to evaluate the use of  a drug detection instrument, the ion mobility spectrometer (IMS), and  to integrate its use into an ongoing pretrial diversion program for  nonviolent, first-time, drug-abusing offenders.

The IMS is a highly sensitive analytic  chemical detector. It is a \"time of flight\" instrument, based on the  ionization of an unknown analyte, the introduction of the ionized  material into a drift tube, and the detection and recording of the  collision of the ionized material with a collector plate. The  combination of the length of time of the material in the drift tube  (the drift time) plotted with the energy detected by the collector  plate produces a characteristic signature, called a plasmagram, which  can be uniquely associated with a known material. The IMS was located  on-site at the diversion program location that was housed within the  New Orleans District Attorney's office complex. Each client in the  diversion program underwent an intensive intake assessment including  an intake radioimmunoassay (RIA) hair assay and an additional RIA  hair assay every 60 days. Each client had a urine test at intake and  was assigned to a random test pool. The modified protocol for the  project added an IMS-based scan or a hair specimen, skin wipe, and  ten-second vacuum scan of clothing, hands, and axillae at intake. At  each subsequent visit each client had a repeat IMS scan utilizing a  skin swab and a scan of clothing or body area. Clients had additional  vacuum scans done when deemed appropriate by a counselor. The  incentive for the offender was that upon successful completion of  program requirements after a prescribed period of time (a minimum of  six months for felonies and three months for misdemeanors), the  charges were dismissed and the person did not appear in  court. Violations of the program conditions resulted in program  dismissal, at which time the case would reenter the normal judicial routing for prosecution."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include self-reported cocaine use,  self-reported marijuana use, IMS date, urinalysis date, hair assay  results, urinalysis results, IMS detection, nicotine use, maximum  amplitude, delta, cumulative amplitude, number of detections, whether  the IMS showed a positive result, and the age, sex, and race of the client."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"diversion programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug offender profiles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug testing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"felony offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"misdemeanor offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pretrial intervention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pretrial procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"urinalysis"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
