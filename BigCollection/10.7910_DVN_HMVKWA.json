In contrast to many economists who study the CMEA, I argue that distributional politics played an important role in the failure of integration: successive initiatives fell victim to the countries' maneuvers to maximize their gains from distortional CMEA prices. In contrast to political scientists of the realist school, I argue that the Soviet trade subsidy could not be employed as a deliberate policy tool, because the Soviet bureaucracy was constitutionally unable to maintain a consistent policy over time. Soviet policy responded to the incentives facing individual Soviet officials, who were rewar\nded and punished in terms of imprecise measures of performance, and who had limited job security.\n<br /><br />I test four theories: \"liberal,\" \"realist,\" \"subsidized-trade,\" and \"institutional.\" Each generates propositions about interests, tactics and outcomes, and the dissertation tests them in a variety of contexts. Chapter 2 uses statistical analysis to refute previous findings that had supported the realist contention that the subsidy was used to punish and reward the satellites. Chapter 3 examines three cases of conflict in the bloc (Czechoslovakia in 1968, Hungary in the 1970s and earl\ny 1980s, and Poland in 1981), arguing that the Soviet subsidy was not used to threaten, punish or reward. Chapter 4 examines bilateral trade negotiations, finding clues to the countries' interests and capabilities in their bargaining tactics. Chapters 5 through 8 cover four case studies of major Soviet integration initiatives: the Comprehensive Program (1971), Long-Term Target Programs (1978-79), Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress (1985) and the Unified Socialist Market (1987-89). In each case, the East European countries maneuvered to maximize their shares of the trade subsidy, and in so doing, crippled the program. In each case, the Soviet bureaucracy failed to defend the Soviet national interest.\n<br /><br />These conclusions are based upon interviews and archival research conducted in Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Political Science"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"International law"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"International relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Business costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Eastern Europe"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard University, Department of Government"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Economic theory"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Government"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Demography"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pursuit of interest: The politics of subsidized trade in the Soviet bloc by Stone, Randall Warren, Ph.D., Harvard University, 1993, 436 pages.<br /><br />  Harvard Affiliates: <a href= \"http://ezp1.harvard.edu/login?url=http://proquest.umi.com.ezp1.harvard.edu/pqdweb?did=745748101&amp;sid=5&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=11201&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD\">Link to Full Text through ProQuest</a><br /><br />All Other Users: Full Text is Available through ProQuest, Document ID: 745748101"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: This study was deposited under the of the Data-PASS standard deposit terms.
