The source of information on  federal funding activity is the GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL  FUNDS (GDFF) series, published annually from 1968-1980 by the Federal  Information Exchange System, a component of the Community Services  Administration (CSA). The files released here have been further  processed by the Intergovernme\nntal Fiscal Analysis Project (at the  University of Michigan) and the Inter-university Consortium for  Political and Social Research (ICPSR), as part of an effort to develop  a comprehensive database for monitoring and analyzing the distribution  of federal funding in the United States. The files differ not only by  units of analysis, but also by what the variables measure. There are  three kinds of variables: (1) dollar amount of program expenditures,  (2) amount expended per capita, and (3) percent of total federal funds  spent on programs in geographic areas. In Part 1, Expenditures by  State, the geographic region is the unit of analysis, and data cover  the 50 states, the District of Columbia, census regions and divisions,  and the nation as a whole. The variables are dollar amounts rounded  off to thousands for each of 150 programs measured at 11 time points  (10 years plus a transition quarter). In Part 2, Per Capita  Expenditures by State, per capita expenditures (rounded off to  thousands) for the top 150 federal programs are measured at 11 time  points. For Part 3, Percent Concentration of Expenditures by State,  percent concentration figures (which are equivalent to state share of  total national program expenditures for the top 150 programs) are  measured at 11 time points. In Part 4, Dollar Expenditures by State by  Year, the record units are geographic units (the 50 states, the  District of Columbia, and census regions) by time point. This file  contains dollar expenditures (rounded off to thousands) for the top  150 programs. For Part 5, Per Capita by State by Year, the variables  are per capita expenditures rounded off to thousands. In Part 6,  Percent Concentration by State by Year, the variables are percent  concentration figures (equivalent to state shares of total national  program expenditures). In Part 7, Dollar Expenditures (Unit Is  Program) for Each State by Year, the federal program is the unit of  analysis and variables describe program characteristics, including  type of recipient, House committee jurisdiction, hard dollars vs. soft  dollars, appropriation account number, program name, type of  assistance, and type of recipient. The remaining variables describe  the program expenditures for each of 11 time points for 66 geographic  units. For Part 8, Per Capita Expenditures (Unit Is Program) for Each  State by Year, variables include per capita expenditures on the  program for the 66 geographic units measured at 11 time points. For  Part 9, Percent Concentration (Unit Is Program) for Each State by  Year, variables include percent concentration of expenditures (share  of the total federal expenditure for the geographic unit) for 66 states/regions for 11 time points."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census regions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"federal budget"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"funding"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government spending"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"states (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR VIII.C.
