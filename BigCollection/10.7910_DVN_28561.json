By amalgamating reports gathered by voluntary vigilantes and tracked in online forums, we identify 192 scams and categorize them into four groups: Ponzi schemes, mining scams, scam wallets and fraudulent exchanges. In 21% of the cases, we also found the associated Bitcoin addresses, which enables us to track payments into and out of the scams. We find that at least $11 million has been contributed to the scams from 13,000 distinct victims. Furthermore, we present evidence that the most successful scams depend on large contributions from a very small number of victims. Finally, we discuss ways in which the scams could be countered."}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-12-31"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-12-31"}]}},"files":[]}}}
