In particular, we show how online prices can be used to construct daily price indexes in multiple countries and to avoid measurement biases that distort evidence of price stickiness and international relative prices. We emphasize how Big Data technologies are providing macro and international economists with opportunities to stop treating the data as “given” and to get directly involved with data collection."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-30"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Online Data "}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Billion Prices Project"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This dataverse contains ONLY THE RAW DATA.
