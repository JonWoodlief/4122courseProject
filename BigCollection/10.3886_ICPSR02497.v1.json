Those queried were asked for their opinions on government   regulation of the prices that business\nes can charge for goods and   services and to comment on rent control systems in New York City,   including whether these laws should be changed, whether rent controls   should be abandoned when a tenant's income rises above a certain   level, whether the controls should be abandoned when a tenant moves   out of the apartment, and whether renters in the city were paying too   much or too little in rent. Those queried were asked what they   believed would happen if the rent controls were abolished, including   a possible rise in rental costs, and construction of apartment   buildings in the city. A series of additional questions addressed the   topic of men's and women's bathing suits. Topics covered whether   modern bathing suits were too revealing, whether the respondent   intended to wear a bathing suit in public during the summer, how the   respondent would describe his/her appearance while wearing a bathing   suit, and whether women should be allowed to go topless at public   beaches. Background information on respondents includes age, race,   ethnicity, sex, education, political party, family income, and  whether the respondent owned or rented his/her residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"businesses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"clothing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fashion industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"multifamily housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rental housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
