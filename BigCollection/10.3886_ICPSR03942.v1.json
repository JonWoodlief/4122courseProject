Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the economy, the United States campaign against terrorism, prescription drug benefits for the elderly, and the situation in Iraq. Opinions were also solicited on the human costs of the war against Iraq, party preferences in the 2004 presidential election, whom they would vote for in the 2004 Democratic presidential primary, and whether they would vote for George W. Bush or the Democratic nominee for president if the 2004 presidential election were being held that day. A series of detailed questions addressed the health care system, health insurance coverage, use of health services, unmet health care needs, out-of-pocket expenses for health care, source of care, patient trust and satisfaction, health status, and presence of chronic health conditions. Respondents were also asked for their views on the investigation by the United States Justice Department into whether someone in the White House broke the law by identifying a former diplomat's wife as an undercover CIA agent. The final set of questions queried respondents on issues related to the Catholic Church, including whether respondents had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the Catholic Church, whether they agreed with the Roman Catholic Church policies that priests cannot get married and that women cannot become priests, whether they approved of the way the Catholic Church was handling the issue of sexual abuse of children by priests, whether they approved of the way Pope John Paul II handled his job as pope, how they would rate the job John Paul II had done, and whether they thought the next pope should maintain the traditional policies of the Church, or should change Church policies to reflect the current attitudes and lifestyles of Catholics. Background variables include education, marital status, whether the respondent had any children under age 18 living at home, employment status, ethnicity, household income, sex and whether the respondent was registered to vote."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Catholic Church"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"healthcare"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"primaries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
