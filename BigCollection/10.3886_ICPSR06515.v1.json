The concept of life integrity is based on six related claims: the right   to life, the right to bodily inviolability, the right to security from   arbitrary punishment, seizure, and detention, the right to own one's   body and labor, the right to free movement without discrimination, and   the right to marry and form a family. Information was obtained for 145   countries and occupied regions by using the Life-Integrity Violation   Analysis (LIVA) form. Scores were then assigned for each country with   respect to life-integrity violation, economic development, and ethnic   discrimination. The study also assessed the status of political rights,   civil liberties, and individual fr\needom. Other variables pertain to the   proportion of national income that went to the top quintile, the GINI   coefficient for income, and whether the area was an occupied territory  or was in the midst of an internal war."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR III.A.
