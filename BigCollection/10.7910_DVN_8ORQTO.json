A majority vote by the floor of the relevant chamber was required to lift immunity. Requests were first dealt with in committee (by the Giunta per le autorizzazioni a procedere) before proceeding to the floor. Most requests over the period on which data are available were not granted; many simply lapsed with the end of the legislature, never having been voted. Legislators were investigated and/or charged with crimes ranging from traffic offenses to murder. Our coding distinguishes opinion crimes (such as libel and slander) from other (more serious) types of malfeasance. A constitutional change in November 1993 ended the requirement that the Chamber approve all requests to remove parliamentary immunity before the judiciary could proceed, and the dataset thus ends with the end of the XI L\negislature in 1994."}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Miriam Golden"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.golden.polisci.ucla.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.polisci.ucla.edu/ps-logo-globe"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1948"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1994"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Shows election dates to the Italian parliament for Legislatures I-XI (date elected, date seated, date dissolved)","label":"Dates.doc","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61653,"categories":["1.
