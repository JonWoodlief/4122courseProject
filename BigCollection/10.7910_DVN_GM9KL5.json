Of those individuals who chose to enroll, are there common characteristics between these individuals? And those who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, how do the plans affect utilization patterns? To test these three regressions, the variable HDHP, general physician visits, specialist physician visits, were estimated using a logit model, due to the binary dependent variables. All levels of schooling higher than the category, less than high school, oneâ€™s employment status, and marital status were the most significantly correlated with an individual enrolling in a high-deductible health plan. For general physician visits, enrolled in a high deductible health plan, all levels of schooling higher than the category, less than high school, gender, age, marital status, health status higher than the category, poor health status, health conditions, and chronic conditions were found most significant. For specialist physician visits, the variables that came up significant were very similar to the previous results, but work was significant, and marital status was insignificant. The results of the three regressions demonstrate over-utilization may not be a large issue with high-deductible health plans, but there are certain individuals who tend to enroll in high deductible health plans."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Kubabom, Maria Isabel"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-09-15"}]}},"files":[{"label":"mrepoli_documentation.pdf","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":76889,"dataFile":{"id":2709981,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/GM9KL5/L4OFHT","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GM9KL5/L4OFHT","filename":"mrepoli_documentation.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":948427,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14fd2a18e04-27ef95a3a5c7","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a349605850582760a40b814552d46b4d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a349605850582760a40b814552d46b4d"}}},{"description":"Melissa Repoli Final Paper","label":"mrepoli_finalpaper.pdf","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":76889,"dataFile":{"id":2709957,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/GM9KL5/TIXPUT","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GM9KL5/TIXPUT","filename":"mrepoli_finalpaper.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":404468,"description":"Melissa Repoli Final Paper","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14fd28b1956-da44e7b8fdaa","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"990838fc23d8c6f886c573fd8db0e70f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"990838fc23d8c6f886c573fd8db0e70f"}}},{"label":"mrepoli_rawdata.xls","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":76889,"dataFile":{"id":2709982,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/GM9KL5/UTUQQA","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GM9KL5/UTUQQA","filename":"mrepoli_rawdata.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":8698880,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14fd2a1fb26-dc8abe68ee17","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"545d509ebe7d1eb43a11c52ecb53e8e2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"545d509ebe7d1eb43a11c52ecb53e8e2"}}}]}}}
