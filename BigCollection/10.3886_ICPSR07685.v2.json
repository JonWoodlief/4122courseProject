The  first longitudinal study to concentrate on the process of retirement  and to include change over a period of time as an object of study, the  six surveys in the Retirement History Longitudinal Survey (RHLS) aimed  at learning in detail the connections between worklife characteristics,  retirement timing, and the determinants of style, quality, and conduct  of retirement. With the 1969 study as a baseline, this study, along   with subsequent biennial studies, record the retirement process as it   developed. To provide information on pre-retirement lives and attitudes   of respondents, questions were asked regarding labor force history,   retirement and retirement plans, health, household, family and social   activities, income, assets, and debts for respondents and their spouses.  Detailed information is provided on the sources and size of income and   assets, as well as debts. Questions also focussed on retirement patterns   and determinants of retirement timing, especially the relationship between   pre-retirement income and expected post-retirement income. Also examined   was the influence exerted by health, anticipated post-retirement needs   and resources, employer policies, and significant work history. Labor  force questions covered the respondents' occupation and attitude  toward that occupation, number of hours worked, salary, unemployment,  and job-seeking behavior. Information on retirement plans included  whether and when the respondents planned to retire, reasons for   retirement, whether they had made retirement plans, such as moving   residences or working, expected expenses and resources, and   subjective attitudes toward retirement. Respondents who were already   partially or fully retired were asked to report retrospectively   on retirement age, reasons for retirement, and whether they had planned   for retirement prior to actually retiring. Questions on health experience  pertained to the calendar year prior to the interview, and included  receipts and costs of physical examinations and dentist visits,  hospitalization, prescription and non-prescription medicines, other   medical supplies and services, health insurance coverage and other   resources for payment of medical expenses, and a measure of the  respondent's own physical health. Questions were also asked concerning  activity and income, including p\nroximity and frequency of contact with  close relatives, and receipt of financial support from relatives.   Information on food and housing, transportation, gifts, and travel   expenses was also gathered to provide a measure of changes in  retirement lifestyle. Demographic items specify sex, age, marital   status, education, income, benefits amount, assets, debts, number   of children and children attending school, and household composition   and relationship. Of the 9,423 cases included in the data file,   495 cases represent interviews with surviving spouses of the original  respondents who died sometime after the original 1969 survey."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"older workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personal finances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement adjustment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement planning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR VI.
