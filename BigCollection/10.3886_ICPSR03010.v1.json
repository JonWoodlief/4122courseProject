The researchers sought to examine factors that influence court officials' decision-making in domestic violence cases, as well as factors that influence victim and witness reluctance in bringing batterers to successful adjudication. In Part 1 researchers merged pretrial services data with information from police and prosecutors' reports in the urban area under study to answer the following questions: (1) What is the rate of dismissals, acquittals, and convictions for misdemeanor court cases and what are the conditions of these sentences? (2) What factors in court cases are significantly related to whether the disposition is a dismissal, acquittal, or conviction, and how are these cases processed? In Part 2, judges, prosecutors, and public defenders were asked detailed questions about their level of knowledge about, attitudes toward, and self-reported behaviors regarding the processing of domestic violence cases to find out: (1) What roles do legal and extra-legal factors play in decision-makers' self-reported behaviors and attitudes? (2) How do decision-makers rate victim advocate and batterer treatment programs? (3) How do court professionals view the victim's role in the court process? and (4) To what degree do court professionals report victim-blaming attitudes and experiences? For Part 3 researchers used a stratified random sample to select court cases of misdemeanor domestic violence that would be transcribed and used for a content analysis to examine: (1) Who speaks in court and how? and (2) What is considered relevant by different court players? In Parts 4-103 victim surveys and interviews were administered to learn about battered women's experiences in both their personal lives and the criminal processing system. Researchers sought to answer the following questions: (1) How do victim\n/witnesses perceive their role in the prosecution of their abusers? (2) What factors inhibit them from pursuing prosecution? (3) What factors might help them pursue prosecution? and (4) How consistent are the victims'/witnesses' demographic and psychological profiles with existing research in this area? Domestic violence victims attending arraignment between January 1 and December 31 of 1997 were asked to complete surveys to identify their concerns about testifying against their partners and to evaluate the effectiveness of the court system in dealing with domestic violence cases (Part 4). The disposition of each case was subsequently determined by a research team member's examination of defendants' case files and/or court computer files. Upon case closure victims who had both completed a survey and indicated a willingness to be interviewed were contacted to participate in an interview (Parts 5-103). Variables in Part 1, Pretrial Services Data, include prior criminal history, current charges, case disposition, sentence, victim testimony, police testimony, victim's demeanor at trial, judge's conduct, type of abuse involved, weapons used, injuries sustained, and type of evidence available for trial. Demographic variables include age, sex, and race of defendants, victims, prosecutors, and judges. In Part 2, Professional Survey Data, respondents were asked about their tolerance for victims and offenders who appeared in court more than once, actions taken when substance abuse was involved, the importance of injuries in making a decision, attitudes toward battered women, the role of victim advocates and the police, views on restraining orders, and opinion on whether arrest is a deterrent. Demographic variables include age, sex, race, marital status, and years of professional experience. Variables in Part 3, Court Transcript Data, include number and type of charges, pleas, reasons for dismissals, types of evidence submitted by prosecutors and defense, substance abuse by victim and defendant, living arrangements and number of children of victim and defendant, specific type of abuse, injuries sustained, witnesses to injuries, police testimony, verdict, and sentence. Demographic variables include age and sex of defendant and victim and relationship of victim and defendant. In Part 4, Victim Survey Data, victims were asked about their relationship and living arrangements with the defendant, concerns about testifying in court, desired outcomes of case and punishment for defendant, emotional issues related to abuse, health problems, substance abuse, support networks, other violent domestic incidents and injuries, and safety concerns. Part 5 variables measured victims' safety at different stages of the criminal justice process and danger experienced due to further violent incidents, presence of weapons, and threats of homicide or suicide.

Data were collected on  the court processing of misdemeanor domestic violence cases from five  sources: (1) pretrial services, (2) interviews and surveys of court  officials, (3) content analysis of court transcripts, (4) surveys of  domestic violence victims, and (5) in-depth interviews with domestic  violence victims. For this study the defendant was defined as any  person who was arraigned in the municipal court between January 1,  1997, and December 31, 1997, for one or more of the following charges  against a person living as a spouse: (1) misdemeanor domestic  violence, (2) violating protection order or consent agreement, (3)  menacing by stalking, and (4) rape. For Part 1, data from pretrial  services were merged with information from police and prosecutors'  reports. Pretrial services asked a large volume of questions of  defendants upon intake. Police officers also completed \"527\" forms and  National Incident-Based Reporting (NIBRS) Program forms on each  case. Additionally, researchers developed a \"green form\" for  prosecutors to help distinguish intimate partner domestic violence  from other domestic violence cases and to provide information from  prosecutors on their perspectives regarding victim behavior, judge's  behavior, and other facets of the case, such as evidence. All 18  prosecutors were instructed to complete these forms for each of their  intimate partner cases. Researchers were able to collect data on 90.5  percent of the 1997 court cases of misdemeanor domestic violence in  the urban area. In Part 2 judges, prosecutors, and public defenders in  the urban area were asked detailed questions about their level of  knowledge about, attitudes toward, and self-reported behaviors  regarding the processing of domestic violence cases. Data were  collected from court professionals through both intensive one-on-one,  face-to-face interviews and detailed written surveys. Although the  majority of questions were asked of all professionals, questions were  altered according to the targeted professional group and its  respective role in the criminal justice system. The surveys addressed  such topics as evaluating the current arrest policy for domestic  violence cases, issues related to bail and treatment mandates, and  reasons why cases were dismissed. Moreover, scales were developed from  Likert questions that ascertained decision-makers' assessments of  concepts such as victim provocation, victim ability to leave, role of  legal an\nd extra-legal factors, treatment for batterers, deterrent  factors, and policies relevant to the processing of domestic violence  misdemeanor cases. Other items addressed in the survey included  factors to be considered in the determination of whether an abuser  should be sentenced and convicted, the influence of various factors on  outcome decisions, criminal justice techniques most likely to be  utilized in the courtroom, and the ranking of factors' effectiveness  in stopping repeat woman battering. A representative from each  professional group provided feedback on the respective measurement  instruments to ensure the comprehensiveness and clarity of the items  being addressed. The average interview was two hours in length. Judges  usually returned the mailback survey within 48 hours, while  prosecutors and public defenders took an average of two weeks to  complete the survey. For Part 3, researchers used a stratified random  sample to select court cases of misdemeanor domestic violence that  would be transcribed and used for a content analysis. Each court  transcript was coded independently by three coders and then reviewed  for consensus. Information was coded on the different actors  (defendant, victim, prosecutor, defense, judge, police, witnesses),  the types of evidence, and the case outcomes. For Parts 4-103 domestic  violence victims attending arraignment between January 1 and December  31 of 1997 were asked if they would participate in the current  study. Victims were told that the study was designed to identify  concerns victims had about testifying against their partners and to  evaluate the effectiveness of the court system in dealing with  domestic violence cases. The names and case numbers of all defendants  charged with spousal abuse-related felonies were identified from the  arraignment dockets, and their names and case numbers recorded by a  research team member. In cases involving cross complaints,  investigators attempted to ascertain who the real victim in the case  was and to request participation of only that individual, despite the  difficulties inherent in this process. Victims were told that  participation involved completing both a survey and an interview for  which they would be paid $10 and $40, respectively. Victims were also  told that their identities would be kept confidential, and that they  could withdraw from the study at any time. Those agreeing to  participate were then given a copy of the survey which they could  complete at the site, or they were given a survey and a business reply  envelope by which they could return their completed surveys (Part  4). The survey took approximately 90 minutes to complete and was  comprised of a large number of measures included to assess constructs  thought to possibly impact victims' decisions to testify. An effort  was also made to assess extent of violence using both direct and  indirect measures. All measures were self-report items. In general,  the survey began with concerns about testifying, then moved to  mediating variables (e.g., support system, post-traumatic stress  disorder), and then to abuse-related measurement instruments (e.g.,  help-seeking behaviors, history of abuse). The disposition of each  case was subsequently determined by a research team member's  examination of defendants' case files and/or court computer  files. Upon case closure victims who had both completed a survey and  indicated a willingness to be interviewed were contacted by any  combination of means necessary to locate them (phone, letter, home  visit) to ask if they would be willing to participate in an interview  (Parts 5-103). One of five interviewers then conducted the interview  during a time and at a location convenient for victims. Interviews  typically took place in victims' homes and were approximately two  hours long. Eighty-five percent of survey participants were located  and interviewed. Interviews were structured in format and designed to  identify conc\nerns of victims about testifying against their partners  and to elicit victims' views regarding how the criminal justice system  handled their cases. Victims' responses to questions were recorded by  hand and typed up within a few days of the interview. No audio  recording devices were used. Although interviewers attempted to record  victims' language as stated, descriptions of victims' statements --  including those written using the first person pronoun -- represent  only interviewers' \"best efforts\" at recording that language by hand  during the interview. Part 5 consists of variables used to create  victim safety and danger scales based on the interviews. Parts 6-103 contain the qualitative interview data."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables in Part 1, Pretrial Services Data,  include prior criminal history, current charges, case disposition,  sentence, victim testimony, police testimony, victim's demeanor at  trial, judge's conduct, type of abuse involved, weapons used, injuries  sustained, and type of evidence available for trial.
