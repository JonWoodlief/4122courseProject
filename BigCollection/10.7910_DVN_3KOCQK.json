In the study of social structure in 1988 it was assumed that the sample size of the adult population country at the age of 21-65 years is estimated at 6,000 people.  Drawings were made in two stages. The first phase covered the layering Polish population aged over 12 years. In each region there are four layers, depending on the size of the place of residence. For this purpose, the sample was divided into villages and small cities (up to 20 thousand. residents), medium (20 to 100 000 inhabitants) and large (over 100,000 inhabitants). This resulted in a total of 196 sampling units. The second phase consisted of the selection - within the perimeter of each census - a certain number of households whose members aged over 12 years would be prepared to become part of the sampling. A uniform draw was conducted in a way that the sampling frame included 130 000 people.  Due to the fact that the use of the strong correlation of samples reserve the size of the city and its administrative status, in each Some of the provinces were distinguished by class of locality and for each of these selected sample of different sizes.  The capital region was treated as a separate class in the Warsaw administrative boundaries, choosing the size of reserve up to 150% of the sample, as to reach the core of the sample of respondents was the most difficult. Other towns and villages in the region were the class of the capital village, for which this ratio was set at 70%. In the ten provinces - Bydgoszcz, Torun, Wloclawek, Siedlce, Szczecin, Jelenia Góra, Wroclaw, Poznan, Gdansk and Czestochowa - introduced three classes cities: the capital city, other cities and all villages. In these classes reserve established in proportions of 70%, 50% and 30%, respectively. Finally, the reserve for the remaining regions was 50% for urban and 30% rural."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Face-to-face interviews"},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured, pre-coded"}]}},"files":[{"description":"POL88A data file, text format.
