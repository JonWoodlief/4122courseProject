This paper studies the birds habitat in Simalungun and Asahan districts, North Sumatera. The study was conducted in four habitats: natural forest, rubber agroforests (RAF), rubber monoculture plantations (RMP) and emplacement areas (EA). The birds were observed using descriptive survey methods by implementing a quick biodiversity survey, data were collected along one km transect.  The results showed that in total, 142 species of birds from 42 families were observed in the four habitats. Natural forests had the highest diversity of bird species, followed by rubber agroforests, emplacement areas and rubber plantations, with a Shannon-Wiener index of 3.8, 3.6, 3.0 and 2.5, respectively. Regarding the IUCN red list species, 12 bird species of near-threatened status and 2 species of vulnerable status were recorded.  Based on CITES categories, one species was listed in the Appendix criteria I, 12 species were classified in Appendix II and 26 bird species were protected under Indonesian regulations. Changes in the structure and composition of vegetation in disturbed forests and cleared land determined the richness of bird species. The different tree compositions in the four habitats of the rubber estate plantations and surrounding areas influence the number of bird species, bird diversity and species composition."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"species composition"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"conservation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CITES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"guild type"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"biodiversity"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ecosystem service"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Forest Research and Development Agency"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Ministry of Environments and Forestry of Indonesia"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FORDA"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.dephut.go.id/"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://huma.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kementerian-Kehutanan-by-Putu-Suastawan1.png"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-11"},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bridgestone"},"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"BRIG-901"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Forest Research and Development Agency"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Ministry of Environment and Forestry"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FORDA"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.dephut.go.id/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://huma.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kementerian-Kehutanan-by-Putu-Suastawan1.png"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-04-06"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey data"]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Tata, HL (ed). 2011.
