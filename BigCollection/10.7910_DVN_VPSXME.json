All 3000 PSUs included in the Master Sample were used in the Labour Force Survey. A PSU is either one EA or several EAs when the number of dwelling units in the base or originally selected EA was found to have less than 100 dwelling units. Each EA had to\r\nhave approximately 150 dwelling units but it was discovered that many contained less. Thus, in some cases, it has been found necessary to add EAs to the original EA to ensure that the minimum requirement of 100 dwellings, in the first stage of forming the PSUs, was met. The size of the PSUs in the Master Sample varied from 100 to 2445 dwelling units. Special dwellings such as prisons, hospitals, boarding houses, hotels, guest houses (whether catering or self-catering), schools and churches were excluded from the sample."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Codebook in PDF format.","label":"DTA900.file2890.S0127.PDF","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":58496,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":2445497,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"DTA900.file2890.S0127.PDF","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":3309840,"description":"Codebook in PDF format.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120529","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f5a5d658daebe8a0391967d310dcecfc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f5a5d658daebe8a0391967d310dcecfc"}}},{"description":"Industry codes in MS Excel format.","label":"DTA900.file2891.INDCODE.XLS","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":58496,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":2445498,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"DTA900.file2891.INDCODE.XLS","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":266240,"description":"Industry codes in MS Excel format.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120530","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"949bbf6f71d2552af0733a789992613b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"949bbf6f71d2552af0733a789992613b"}}},{"description":"Occupation codes in MS Word format.","label":"DTA900.file2892.OCCCODE.DOC","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":58496,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":2445499,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"DTA900.file2892.OCCCODE.DOC","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":1174528,"description":"Occupation codes in MS Word format.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120531","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"de8c4a9619d654e6e37cf136a7d380ff","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"de8c4a9619d654e6e37cf136a7d380ff"}}},{"description":"Stratum PSU data in Stata format.","label":"DTA900.file2893.STRATUM_PUS.DTA","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":58496,"categories":["Stata data"],"dataFile":{"id":2445502,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"DTA900.file2893.STRATUM_PUS.DTA","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":320000,"description":"Stratum PSU data in Stata format.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120533","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b3f5413a99265456de46fd0feec41b9f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b3f5413a99265456de46fd0feec41b9f"}}},{"description":"House data in Stata format.","label":"DTA900.file2894.HOUSE.DTA","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":58496,"categories":["Stata data"],"dataFile":{"id":2445501,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"DTA900.file2894.HOUSE.DTA","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":7034196,"description":"House data in Stata format.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120534","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f54320813311de313ae4f7e3f0f54c8a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f54320813311de313ae4f7e3f0f54c8a"}}},{"description":"Person data in Stata format.","label":"DTA900.file2895.PERSON.DTA","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":58496,"categories":["Stata data"],"dataFile":{"id":2445503,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"DTA900.file2895.PERSON.DTA","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":16863770,"description":"Person data in Stata format.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120535","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6ac19fe4834de47347f1e46cabccfa7a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6ac19fe4834de47347f1e46cabccfa7a"}}},{"description":"Worker data in Stata format.","label":"DTA900.file2896.WORKER.DTA","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":58496,"categories":["Stata data"],"dataFile":{"id":2445504,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"DTA900.file2896.WORKER.DTA","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":27335610,"description":"Worker data in Stata format.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120536","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"cf65590ccb230fa38792ea4a3146448b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"cf65590ccb230fa38792ea4a3146448b"}}}]}}}
