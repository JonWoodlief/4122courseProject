In addition to coordinates there are columns indicating the diameter at breast height ('dbh' - cm), the altitutde ('alt' - m); the gender of the collectors who commonly visit the tree ('ntfp_col', where 'm', 'w' and 'c' indicate men, women and children); an indicator of how the production of the food resource at the tree has changed over the last 5 years ('prod_ind'); whether trips to collect resources from the tree are organised or not ('trips' ); other activities in the area around the tree ('agri', 'hunt', 'fish', 'ntfp' and 'other'); and whether the tree is within an adjacent logging concession or allocated agricultural zone ('overlap' and 'agrizone').\r\n5 male and 5 female informants were selected in each village. They led the researchers (1 male and 1 female) to the trees from which they commonly collected food resources. At each tree the geographical position was taken with a GPS, the dbh was measured and a series of questions concerning the collection, availability and accessibility of food resources from the tree. The points were mapped with polygons indicating logging concessions, indicating the type of land in which they were located (i.e. logging concession, community forest, unclassified forest estate, etc.) \r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences","Earth and Environmental Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NON-WOOD FOREST PRODUCTS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LOGGING"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LICENSES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"TREES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FOOD"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"RURAL COMMUNITIES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bioversity International"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-03-14"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-02"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-03"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Geo-referenced data"]},{"typeName":"otherReferences","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["CRP 6: CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry"]}]}},"files":[]}}}
