Respondents were asked about   their own form of health insurance, the source of that coverage, and   their level of knowledge concerning Clinton's health care plan. Items   assessing Clinton's proposal for health care focused on respondents'   approval of the plan, whether the plan was better than the present   system, and whether respondents would support an increase in taxes to   help pay for Clinton's health care plan. Respondents were also queried   regarding what they thought the effect of Clinton's plan would be on   how much they paid for health insurance, the effect of the plan on   health insurance coverage and the quality of health care, whether   Congress should pass Clinton's plan, and whether the plan created too   much government involvement in the nation's health care system. Items   assessing respondents' grasp of the details of Clinton's plan dealt   with contingencies such as whether switching doctors, hospitals, or   insurance companies would be necessary under the new plan, whether all   the costs of health insurance for workers and their families would be   covered under the new plan, whether people who lost or quit their jobs   would also lose their coverage under the new plan, the effect of the   plan on people who were on welfare and people who were not working, and   whether going to the doctor or hospital would involve filling out more   paperwork under the new plan. Respondents were also asked for their   opinions about Clinton's plan for a health security card, whether they   were concerned about various potential repercussions of the health care   plan, including increased government bureaucracy, a decline in the   quality of medical care, limited choice of doctors or hospitals, or   increased taxes to pay for the plan, and whether they thought Clinton's   plan would help or hurt various constituencies such as doctors, small   businesses, insurance companies, and retired people. Additional survey   items covered whether the Clinton administration had a complete plan   for health care reform, whether Clinton had described all the important   features of the plan to the public, and whether people such as Hillary   Clinton, Newt Gingrich, or Robert Dole, among others, had influenced   how respondents thought about the health care plan.
