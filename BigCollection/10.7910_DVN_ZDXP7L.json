Our results suggest that this hypothesis is correct. Firms exposed to\r\na shock to their bribe schedules by a change in governor invest significantly less\r\nin subsequent periods, as they wait for new information about their new chief\r\nexecutive. Furthermore, the amount of corruption (both measured by survey data\r\nand proxied by the number of commercial sex workers) is significantly lower in\r\nprovinces with new governors.
