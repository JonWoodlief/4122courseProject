The NH2MS cohort is comprised of adult respondents to the NHANES  II who were 30-75 years of age at the time of the NHANES II, and who  were interviewed and examined for NHANES II. Some participants who  were 74 years of age during their interview turned 75 years old  between their interview and the examination. The NHANES series of data  collections included standardized physical examinations, laboratory  tests, and interviews that covered various health-related topics. The  NH2MS was designed to investigate the association between factors  measured at baseline and overall mortality or death from specific  causes. The NH2MS involved searching national databases containing  information about mortality and causes of death. The study was  entirely passive: participants were not recontacted, nor were all  death certificates obtained. Instead, mortality status was ascertained  solely by computerized matching to national databases and evaluation  of the resulting matches. Furthermore, no recontact is planned in the  future. Rather, matching to the National Death Index (NDI) and to  other national databases will continue on a periodic basis. The  Mortality Status file (Part 1) contains mortality status and  demographic data for all NH2MS participants who were 30-75 years of  age at their NHANES II examination. The Cause of Death file (Part 2)  contains one record for each known decedent for whom multiple causes  of death were obtained (2,103 out of the 2,145 participants identified  as deceased). Cause of death is missing for some decedents either  because there was no matching record on the NCHS Multiple Cause of  Death files or the death certificate was not found through the state vital statistics office."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"causes of death"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"death records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mortality rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"older adults"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social indicators"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vital statistics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.G.

One important  ramification of the NH2MS design is that persons not found to be  deceased are assumed to be alive for analytic purposes. As a result,  there is a potential for misclassification of vital  status. Researchers using the NH2MS data should be aware of this study  limitation. (2) During this first wave of the study, mortality status  was ascertained for the years 1976-1992. Two participants were unable  to be followed because of incomplete personal identifying data and  are considered lost to follow-up. The 9,250 cohort members were traced  in the NH2MS by searching national databases containing mortality and  cause-of-death information. The length of follow-up period ranges from  12-16 years. Approximately 23 percent (n = 2,145) of the NH2MS cohort  were found to be deceased as of December 31, 1992.
