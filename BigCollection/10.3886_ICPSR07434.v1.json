Wider in scope than previous studies of local labor markets and particular categories of workers, this investigation obtained information about attitudes, motives, and the economic circumstances of families, in addition to migration history and demographic characteristics. A broad range of data were collected on the causes of mobility and obstacles to mobility, the process of mobility, and its consequences. Three waves of interviews were conducted in August-September 1962, November-December 1962, and November 1963 with national cross-section samples of the adult population. From each household, either the head or the spouse was interviewed. Special samples of people living in redevelopment areas and having recently moved were also surveyed, and a panel of respondents selected from both a cross-national sample and residents of redevelopment areas was reinterviewed in August 1963. The data collection includes three files. Part 1 contains information for all respondents, including reinterviews, organized around the family as unit of analysis. Filter variables allow a separate analysis of cross-sectional data. In Part 2 the unit of analysis is the move, with variables documenting year, geographic region and state, and reasons for the move. Part 3 provides information about the relocation of adult offspring, other than the first, aged 18-29. Demographic data include age, sex, race, marital status, income, occupation, and level of education."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor force"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population migration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR V.
