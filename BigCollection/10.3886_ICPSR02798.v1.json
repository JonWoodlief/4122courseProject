It is the street-level  officers who can be expected to directly experience many of these  changes and challenges. These officers are the ones who can best  describe what community policing looks like at its most basic  level. The purpose of this study was to examine community policing from a street-level officer's point of view."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For this study active community police officers  and sheriff's deputies from law enforcement agencies were interviewed  about their opinions, experiences with, and attitudes toward community  policing. Ninety rank-and-file community policing officers from 30 law  enforcement agencies throughout the United States were selected to  participate in a 40- to 60-minute telephone survey. The survey  generally dealt with perceptions of the value and efficacy of  community policing as it related to the community. The survey  instrument was developed through a three-step process. First, a  literature search was conducted to identify previous surveys of  line-level community police officers. Those surveys having a component  that addressed community policing from the officer's point of view  were solicited from the responsible agencies or parties. Appropriate  items were then adapted for the survey under development. Second, to  ensure that the survey would be grounded in actual experiences, the  researchers visited local community policing sites to get a first-hand  view of community-oriented policing. Information gathered from these  visits was integral to the design of the survey. Once the preliminary  survey was completed, it was tested by the researchers to determine if  the questions' structure and type were amenable to a telephone  survey. Due to the time constraints associated with the administration  of a telephone interview, many questions, including a victim services  section, were dropped. Third, interview procedures were standardized  by conducting practice interviews and by monitoring selected  interviews. The survey was tested in a series of pilot interviews with  local community-oriented police officers to gauge the length of the  interviews and to ensure that the survey questions were worded  correctly. Further modifications were made after these interviews. A  more extensive pilot test was performed using the first ten officers  formally interviewed. A number of questions were added to the survey  and changes were made in the scoring of the task analysis section,  rendering data from the\nfirst ten respondents unusable for that  section. Each of the law enforcement agencies in the sample was sent a  letter of introduction and a project information sheet. A follow-up  call was made to each department to ensure that the fax transmission  was successful and to determine if the letter and project information  were received by the chief or sheriff. The officers selected were  contacted by letter and phone. Once contact was made, the officers  were interviewed at a time when the officers felt comfortable and  confident of privacy. As the surveys were completed, they were coded  so that data could not be matched to an agency or to an officer's name."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The survey questions covered topics from six  categories: (1) demographics, including the race, gender, age, job  title, highest level of education, and union membership of each  respondent, (2) a description of the community policing program and  daily tasks, with items regarding the size of the neighborhood in  terms of geography and population, work with citizens and community  leaders, patrol methods, activities with youth/juveniles, traditional  police duties, and agency and supervisor support of community  policing, (3) interaction between community policing and non-community  policing officers, (4) hours, safety, and job satisfaction, (5) training, and (6) perceived effectiveness of community policing."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community policing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhoods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police citizen interactions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police community relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police patrol"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
