Specifically, the study explores how family orientation (i.e., familism and family conflict) and achievement orientation differ among these groups. The participants were 189 adolescents (96 girls and 93 boys) between the ages of 13 and 18 who were attending public middle and high schools. The participants were equally divided among the four groups. Data for the Mexican sample were gathered in 1991 and 1992 in Guanajuato, one of three Mexican states from which a majority of emigrants to the United States originate. Data for the other three groups were gathered in 1992 from public schools in California.\r\n<br /><br />  The data collection methods consisted of classroom observations, ethnographic interviews, and tests which were conducted in either English, Spanish, or both according to the students' preference and proficiency. The interviews covered demographic, life-history, and migration-related information as well as issues related to their experiences at school and with their families and peers. The interview included a number of psychological tests: Familism Scale (Sabogal et al.,1987), Family Conflict Scale (Beavers, Hampson, and Hulgus, 1985), Sentence Completion Test (De Vos, 1973), Problem Situation Test (De Vos, 1973), and Thematic Apperception Tests (Murray, 1943).\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds the completed interview booklets as well as audiotapes of interviews.
