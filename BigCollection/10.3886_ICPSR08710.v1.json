While   the 51 STF 3D files contain several levels of geographic   hierarchy--state, congressional district, county or county   equivalent, places with 10,000 or more inhabitants, and minor civil   divisions with 10,000 or more inhabitants--with one file per state,   this extract file presents data for one geographical level, the   congressional district, and contains records for all congressional   districts in the nation in one physical file. The 436 congressional   districts described in the file are defined according to the   boundaries established for the 98th Congress. Summary Tape File 3   consists of detailed tabulations of the nation's population and   housing characteristics and is composed of five parts: STF 3A, STF   3B, STF 3C, STF 3D, and STF 3H. These files contain sample data   inflated to represent the total population but also include   100-percent counts and unweighted sample counts for some variables.   Complete-count data are supplied for demographic characteristics such   as age, race, sex, marital status, and Spanish origin, and for   housing information such as as the number of units at the address,   number of rooms, occupancy status, tenure, property value, and   plumbing facilities.
