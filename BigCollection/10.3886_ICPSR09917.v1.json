The major objectives of the study were  to gather data about the inmate population and current management  policies and procedures, to identify issues facing correctional  administrators in supervising the growing number of condemned inmates,  and to offer options for improved management. Four survey instruments  were developed: (1) a form for the Department of Corrections in each  of the 37 states that had a capital punishment statute as of March  1986, (2) a form for each warden of an institution that housed  death-sentenced inmates, (3) a form for staff members who worked with  such inmates, and (4) a form for a sample of the inmates. The surveys  included questions about inmate demographics (e.g., date of birth,  sex, race, Hispanic origin, level of education, marital status, and  number of children), the institutional facilities available to death  row inmates, state laws pertaining to them, training for staff who  deal with them, the usefulness of various counseling, medical, and  recreational programs, whether the inmates expected to be executed,  and the challenges in managing the death row population. The surveys  did not probe legal, moral, or political arguments about the death penalty itself."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The American Correctional Association undertook  this study to explore prison management practices insofar as they  affect the death row population. The increasing number of inmates  awaiting execution nationwide and the increasing length of time those  inmates spend on death row may affect management practices now and in  the future. Areas of inquiry for this study included classification of  death row inmates as well as their housing, security, staffing, and  freedom of movement. The survey gathered basic demographic data about  the inmates and their use of time during incarceration, including  policies for the access given death row inmates to medical services,  counseling services, religious and recreational activities, food  service, vocational and avocational training, work, education, legal  visits, mail and telephone privileges, and grievance procedures. Other  policy questions addressed by this study included determining the  necessity of confining all condemned inmates in one location, the  extent of contact between death row inmates and other inmates, the  necessity of altering staffing patterns and training staff to manage these inmates, and the liability concerns of death row supervision."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was designed to help provide  information on death-sentenced inmates in terms of long-term  correctional assignments.
