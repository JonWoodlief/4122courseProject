Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way President  George W. Bush was handling the presidency as well as the way things  were going in the United States. Respondents' opinions were elicited  about whether they supported the United States going to war with Iraq,  whether that support would change if the United States found chemical  and/or biological weapons in Iraq, whether Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein had to be killed/captured for the war to be considered a  success, and whether the people of Iraq were on the side of the United  States or Hussein. Those queried were asked to assess how the war was  going, whether the number of United States military casualties had  been acceptable, and whether everything had been done to avoid  civilian casualties. Respondents were asked whether they were  surprised at how quickly the United States military took control of  Baghdad, and whether they considered the war with Iraq basically  over. A series of questions addressed post-war Iraq. Topics covered  whether the United States or the United Nations should be in charge  until a new government was established, whether a large number of  soldiers should remain in Iraq to maintain peace, whether the war  would leave the United States in a stronger or weaker position in the  world, and how the war would affect stability in the Middle  East. Views were sought on the likelihood that the United States would  become bogged down in a drawn-out war with Iraq, whether the war would  cause long-term damage to United States relations with France,  Germany, and Russia, and whether the United States would be too quick  to use military force to resolve disputes in the future. Lastly,  respondents were asked whether the United States had done the right  thing by going to war with Iraq.
