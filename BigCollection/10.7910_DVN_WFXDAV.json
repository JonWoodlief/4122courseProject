To measure the Asatidz competency level in teaching Arabic Language and Islamic Values, the tool used was taken from Curriculum Management Assessment Data culled from the fourth domain of the Philippine National Competency-Based Teacher Standard (NCBTS).\r\nThe Descriptive-correlational method was used in this study. The results of responses coming from all Asatidz in nine (9) Madaris of Digos City were used in the analysis using the relative frequency, mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r.\r\nResults of the study disclosed that there was no significant relationship between the demographic profile of the Asatidz and the extent of their Madrasah curriculum implementation. Also, on the extent of the problems met by the Asatidz and the extent of their Madrasah curriculum implementation did not show a significant relationship. However on educational attainment, there was a  highly significant relationship in the implementation of Madrasah curriculum. \r\nIt is recommended that the DepEd must design policies that will provide more education trainings for Asatidz to become more capable of helping students to acquire the competencies needed to evolve in todayâ€˜s society.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Arts and Humanities"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-11"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Philippines"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"4"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2/2016"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"dissertation"}]}},"files":[{"description":"May-August 2016 Issue (Vol 4, No 2/2016)","label":"Full Thesis_EVALUATION OF MADRASAH EDUCATION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF DIGOS CITY.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88808,"dataFile":{"id":2917489,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WFXDAV/1TGTGD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WFXDAV/1TGTGD","filename":"Full Thesis_EVALUATION OF MADRASAH EDUCATION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF DIGOS CITY.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":2183256,"description":"May-August 2016 Issue (Vol 4, No 2/2016)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:158552a58ed-3c2c21b2a354","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ae7d66b7a5bb1616a63a34b562c74963","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ae7d66b7a5bb1616a63a34b562c74963"}}},{"description":"May-August 2016 Issue (Vol 4, No 2/2016)","label":"Thesis Inner_EVALUATION OF MADRASAH EDUCATION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF DIGOS CITY.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88808,"dataFile":{"id":2917488,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WFXDAV/4EXQYB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WFXDAV/4EXQYB","filename":"Thesis Inner_EVALUATION OF MADRASAH EDUCATION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF DIGOS CITY.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":384430,"description":"May-August 2016 Issue (Vol 4, No 2/2016)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:158552987bc-1ec1050c9b67","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a0b78ac9582f9a8effde7e14274dd87d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a0b78ac9582f9a8effde7e14274dd87d"}}}]}}}
