Respondents were asked their opinions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, how they would vote if the election were held on the day of the survey, if they had ever thought of voting for the other party's candidate, how they would vote if they were only voting for president or vice-president, and how they would vote in the United States Senate election between Pete Wilson and Leo McCarthy. Respondents were asked about registration status, previous voting behavior, their attention to the campaign, Ronald Reagan's job performance, whether Dan Quayle was qualified to serve as president, if they had been contacted on behalf of either of the presidential candidates, and how they thought George Bush and Michael Dukakis would deal with national defense, California's environment, and crime. Other topics included eco\nnomic development versus environmental protection, elimination of oil drilling off the California coast, California's economy, the death penalty, and the truthfulness of the candidates' political advertisements. Background information on individuals includes party affiliation, employment in defense industries, ethnicity, age, income, and education."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
