Performances of police agencies organized in different  ways were compared as they delivered services to different sets of  comparable neighborhoods. For Part 1, Citizen Debriefing Data, data  were drawn from telephone interviews conducted with citizens who were  involved in police-citizen encounters or who requested police services  during the observed shifts. The file contains data on the citizens  involved in observed encounters, their satisfaction with the delivered  services, and neighborhood characteristics. This file includes  variables such as the type of incident, estimated property loss,  police response time, type of action taken by police, citizen  satisfaction with the handling of the problem by police, reasons for  dissatisfaction, the emotional state of the citizen during the  encounter, whom the officers referred the citizen to for help, the  citizen's prior contacts with police, and the citizen's education,  age, sex, and total family income. Part 2, General Shift Information,  contains data describing the shift (i.e., the eight-hour tour of duty  to which the officers were assigned), the officers, and the events  occurring during an observed shift. This file includes such variables  as the total number of encounters, a breakdown of dispatched runs by  type, the number of contacts with other officers, the number of  contacts with non-police support units, officer discretion in taking  legal action, and officer attitudes on patrol styles and  activities. Part 3, Police Encounters Data, describes police  encounters observed by the research team during selected shifts. It  consists of information\ndescribing the officers' role in encounters  with citizens observed during a shift and their demeanor toward the  citizens involved. The file includes variables such as the type of  encounter, how the encounter began, whether the citizens involved  possessed a weapon, the encounter location, what other agencies were  present during the encounter and when they arrived, police actions  during the encounter, the role of citizens involved in the encounter,  the demeanor of the officer toward the citizens during the encounter,  actions taken by the citizens, which services were requested by the  citizens, and how the observer affected the encounter. Part 4,  Victimization Survey Data, examined citizen attitudes about the police and  crime in their neighborhoods. The data were obtained through telephone  interviews conducted by trained interviewers. These interviews  followed a standard questionnaire designed by the project  leaders. Variables include perceived risk of victimization,  evaluations of the delivery of police services, household  victimization occurring in the previous year, actions taken by  citizens in response to crime, and demographic characteristics of the neighborhood."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police activity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police protection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Missouri"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Missouri-St. Louis"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victimization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

SAS data definition statements were added and SPSS data  definition statements were updated for Parts 1-3. SAS and SPSS data  definition statements were created for Part 4. ICPSR created a PDF  codebook for the LRECL data and converted the original codebook and data collection instruments to PDF.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: LRECL with SAS, SPSS, and Stata setup files, SAS transport file, and SPSS portable file;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: (1) Column locations and widths of variables noted in  the data collection coding guides within the original codebook do not  describe the data in its present format. Some of the variables noted  in these coding guides have also been deleted from the data. Users  should refer to the ICPSR codebook or SAS or SPSS data definition  statements for the current variable list and column locations. (2) The  General Shift Information (Part 2) file contains a variable named  TIMERUN. The values for this variable are incorrect. Analysis  utilizing the variable will probably be misleading. Users of this file  will note that 49 shifts are represented twice in the data. This  occurred because a single observer was unable to observe a shift in  its entirety, thus requiring that the shift be split between two  members of the research team. The split shift\nwas then coded as two  cases in the data. (3) Value labels are not provided in the data  dictionary files for the variables identifying the observed  neighborhoods because these labels are unique in each  jurisdiction. The variables identifying the neighborhoods contain some  values that are not identified on the list of jurisdictions and  neighborhoods. These values refer to combinations of  neighborhoods. (4) The variable identifying the observed shift  contains values that are not included in the original format of the  variable. It is not known which shifts these values refer to.
