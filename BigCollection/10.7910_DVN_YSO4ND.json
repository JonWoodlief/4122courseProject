Those defending a vision of a non-racist Brazil attribute such inequalities to mechanisms perpetuating class distinctions. We examine how members of disadvantaged groups perceive their disadvantage and determinants of self-reports of discriminatory experiences, using 2010 AmericasBarometer data. About a third of respondents reports experiencing discrimination. Consistent with Brazilian national myths, respondents are much more likely to report discrimination due to their class than to their race. Nonetheless, the respondent’s skin color, as coded by the interviewer, is a strong determinant of reporting class as well as race and gender discrimination. Race is more strongly associated with perceived “class” discrimination than are household wealth, education, or region of residence; female gender intensifies the association between color and discrimination."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-01-26"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race; gender; discrimination; intersectionality; Brazilian politics"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The AmericasBarometer data used in this paper is available at the following website: www.LapopSurveys.org.
