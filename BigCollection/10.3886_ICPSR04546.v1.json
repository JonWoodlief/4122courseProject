Using Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) techniques, the study explored the relationship between unemployment and property crimes (burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and robbery) in Virginia from 1995 to 2000. Unemployment rates were obtained from the Department of Labor, while crime rates were obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports.

Annual  data on unemployment rates were obtained from the United States  Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site for the  years 1995 through 2000. Information on reported crime rates was  obtained from the Geospatial and Statistical Data Center of the  University of Virginia from data collected by the United States  Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (Uniform  Crime Reports). The study focused on crimes classified as property  crimes under the Uniform Crime Reports (burglary, larceny, motor  vehicle theft, and robbery) and on total index crimes. The Crime Index  total is the sum of selected serious offenses including murder and  non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and the  three property crimes, and was included in the study because reporting  rates are most valid for index crimes. Finally, information on both  age distributions and measures used in the resource deprivation scale  were obtained from the county-level census files of the Geospatial and  Statistical Data Center at the University of Virginia. The resource  deprivation scale was created from 1990 Census data combining the  following measures: logged median family income, percentage of  families living below the poverty line, and percentage of African American residents."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data include the Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS) county codes for the state of Virginia, the name of  county or city, and region variable to indicate if the county is in  the western, northern, or eastern region of the state.
