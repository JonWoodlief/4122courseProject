In contrast to the popular viewpoint that  police corruption is a result of moral defects in the individual  police officer, this study investigated corruption from an  organizational viewpoint. The approach examined the ways rules are  communicated to officers, how rules are enforced by supervisors,  including sanctions for violation of ethical guidelines, the unspoken  code against reporting the misconduct of a fellow officer, and the  influence of public expectations about police behavior. For the  survey, a questionnaire describing 11 hypothetical scenarios of police  misconduct was administered to 30 police agencies in the United  States. Specifically, officers were asked to compare the violations in  terms of seriousness and to assess the level of sanctions each  violation of policies and procedures both should and would likely  receive. For each instance of misconduct, officers were asked about  the extent to which they supported agency discipline for it and their  willingness to report it. Scenarios included issues such as off-duty  private business, free meals, bribes for speeding, free gifts,  stealing, drinking on duty, and use of excessive force. Additional  information was collected about the officers' personal  characteristics, such as length of time in the police force (in  general and at their agency), the size of the agency, and the level of rank the officer held."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study examined police officers' perceptions  of and tolerance for corruption. Much attention has been devoted to  the discussion of causes of police corruption -- the abuse of authority  by an officer for personal gain. The intent of this research was to  answer questions that are crucial to the  organizational/occupational-culture theory of police corruption and  practical police administration. These questions are: (1) What is the  level of knowledge of organizational rules governing corruption? (2)  How strongly does the occupational culture condemn behavior that those  rules prohibit? (3) What punishment is expected for violation of those  rules? (4) To what extent does occupational culture support punishment  of the violation? and (5) To what extent are the views of the  individual officer different from the norm of the occupational  culture? These issues were addressed by examining officers' responses  to questions based on 11 hypothetical scenarios of police  misconduct. The study objective in using hypothetical scenarios was to  obtain a more realistic report of officers' views on corrupt  activities than would have been obtained if officers were asked about their own or fellow officers' activities."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The project was designed to be a cross-national  study of police integrity both among and within nations. However, this  collection only contains the data from the 30 agencies examined in the  United States. A police officer liaison at each agency distributed and  collected questionnaires from willing participants. Questionnaires  presented 11 brief scenarios describing practices that would be  recognizable to police in any modern, industrial society. Included in  the 11 scenarios were nine that described behavior generally regarded  as corrupt, one that described an incident of intentional use of  excessive force, and another that described a behavior -- conducting  an off-duty, security business -- that is pe\nrmitted by some police  agencies and prohibited in others. For each scenario, officers were  asked to rate the seriousness of the misconduct described, the extent  to which they would support agency discipline of it, and their willingness to report such behavior."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Respondents were asked several questions about each  of the 11 scenarios.
