An  eastern Massachusetts district court administered the domestic  violence program. The study followed the criminal behavior of 342 men  that were originally arrested for domestic violence within the court's  jurisdiction between February 1995 and March 1996. Using criminal  history records, this study followed the criminal behavior of the  cohort until December 2004. First, researchers accessed the state's  criminal history file, which contains a complete record of all  Massachusetts court arraignments by charge. Consequently, researchers  were able to track all defendant arrests that resulted in court  arraignments through 2004. The researchers also accessed individual  court criminal and civil records manually maintained by court  clerk-magistrates. These records provide victim and defendant information and copies of issued restraining orders."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1, Arrest Data, variables include the dates of  arrests, dispositions, and restraining orders issued, the arrest  charge, disposition of the case, and time between the arrests.
