The focus of this data collection was the performance of the  United States Postal Service in the District of Columbia. Respondents  were asked to rate first class mail service to their homes, counter  service at the post office, the delivery of periodicals, and overall  performance compared to years past. They were asked to give opinions  on acceptable lengths of delivery times if the sender were local  versus 600 miles from the recipient. Specific\nquestions addressed  whether respondents experienced any problems receiving mail and  whether, given the level of service received, they thought that 32 or  29 cents to mail a letter first class was worth the expense.  Background variables include age, call-back receptivity, ethnicity, household income, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mail"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mail delivery"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
