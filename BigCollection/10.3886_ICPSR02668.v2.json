Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the economy, and the situation with Iraq. Their views were also\nsought on the weekend decision by the United States to delay launching air strikes against Iraq after Saddam Hussein promised unconditional access to United Nations weapons inspections teams. Respondents were asked whether they believed Hussein's promise, whether air strikes would be an appropriate immediate reaction if Iraq failed to keep that promise, whether the goal of insuring that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction was worth the possible loss of American lives, and whether air strikes, if launched, should continue until Hussein complied or was removed from office. A series of questions addressed the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. Topics covered Clinton's guilt or innocence, the November 13, 1998, settlement between Jones and Clinton's lawyers for $850,000, and whether that settlement meant that Clinton had admitted his guilt. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, political party, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hussein, Saddam"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military air strikes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"weapons inspections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
