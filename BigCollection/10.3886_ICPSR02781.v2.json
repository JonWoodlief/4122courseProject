Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, and the situation in Yugoslavia involving Serbia and Kosovo. Those queried were asked for their views on the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air strikes against military targets in Yugoslavia. Topics covered the importance of regional peace to United States interests, whether the military activity is worth the loss of American lives, Clinton's explanation of the situation, the possibility of widespread war, and whether the United States will send ground troops to the area. Respondents were asked for their opinions on the March 31, 1999, capture of three United States soldiers near Kosovo and whether the United States should increase its military actions in Yugoslavia in r\nesponse. Additional questions addressed the ethnic Albanian refugee situation in the region. Topics covered whether the air strikes or the Serbs are responsible for the situation, whether the United States has a responsibility to provide humanitarian aid to assist the refugees, Clinton's pledge of $50 million in humanitarian assistance, and whether genocide is the proper term to describe Serb actions against the ethnic Albanians. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, political party, political orientation, marital status, education, race, Hispanic origin, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
