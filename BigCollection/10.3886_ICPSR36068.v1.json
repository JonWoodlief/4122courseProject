FRSS is designed to collect issue-oriented data within a relatively short time frame. FRSS collects data from state education agencies, local education agencies, public and private elementary and secondary schools, public school teachers, and public libraries. To ensure minimal burden on respondents, the surveys are generally limited to three pages of questions, with a response burden of about 30 minutes per respondent. Sample sizes are relatively small (usually about 1,000 to 1,500 respondents per survey) so that data collection can be completed quickly. Data are weighted to produce national estimates of the sampled education sector. The sample size is large enough to permit limited breakouts by classification variables. However, as the number of categories within the classification variables increases, the sample size within categories decreases, which results in larger sampling errors for the breakouts by classification variables.</p>\n\n<p>The Secondary School Arts Education Survey, Fall 2009 data provide national estimates on student access to arts education and the resources available for such instruction in public secondary schools during fall 2009. This is one of a set of seven surveys that collected data on arts education during the 2009-10 school year. In addition to this survey, the set includes a survey of elementary school principals, three elementary teacher-level surveys, and two secondary teacher-level surveys.

The missing items included both numerical data such as the number of visual arts courses offered by the school, as well as categorical data such as whether coursework in the arts was a specific requirement for graduation. The missing data were imputed using a \"hot-deck\" approach to obtain a \"donor\" school from which the imputed values were derived. Under the hot-deck approach, a donor school that matched selected characteristics of the school with missing data (the recipient school) was identified. The matching characteristics included characteristics of the school such as categories of school enrollment size; locale; categories for percent combined enrollment of Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native students; and categories for percent of students in the school eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. In addition, relevant questionnaire items were used to form appropriate imputation groupings. Once a donor was found, it was used to obtain the imputed values for the school with missing data. For categorical items, the imputed value was simply the corresponding value from the donor school. For numerical items, an appropriate ratio (e.g., percent of part-time music teachers who are specialists) was calculated for the donor school, and this ratio was applied to available data (e.g., number of part-time music specialists) for the recipient school to obtain the corresponding imputed value.

This secondary school survey was part of a study consisting of seven surveys that were administered during the 2009-10 school year. At the elementary school level, the study included a survey of school principals and three teacher-level surveys, one each for self-contained classroom teachers, music specialists, and visual arts specialists. At the secondary school level, the study included a survey of school principals and two teacher-level surveys, one each for music specialists and visual arts specialists. NCES is releasing separate data files for each of the seven surveys.</p>\n\n<p>The sampling frames for the school surveys and teacher list collections were based on regular public schools from the 2006-07 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe file, which was the most current file available at the time of sample selection. The sampling frame included 85,962 regular public schools. Of these, 52,807 were elementary schools, 31,133 were secondary schools, and 2,022 were combined schools. The frame included regular public elementary and secondary sc\nhools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and excluded special education, vocational, home, adult education, private, and alternative/other schools; schools in the outlying United States territories; schools operated by the Department of Defense or Bureau of Indian Education; schools lacking any grade higher than kindergarten; and schools with only ungraded students. Charter schools were eligible for inclusion because they were classified as regular schools in the CCD.</p>\n\n<p>Separate stratified samples of public elementary and secondary schools were selected to receive the appropriate survey instrument for the school-level surveys and teacher list collections. Combined schools were given a chance for selection for both surveys and, if selected, were asked to complete only the survey instrument for which they were selected. To select the sample, the sampling frame was stratified by instructional level. Elementary and secondary schools were also stratified by school enrollment size. To improve the representativeness of the sample, an implicit stratification was induced by sorting the schools within each stratum by geographic region; community type; percent combined enrollment of Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native students; and percent eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.</p>\n\n<p>Secondary schools were selected for the principals' survey in two phases. In the first phase of selection, a sample of 1,602 schools was selected for the purpose of constructing teacher lists for the related surveys of music and arts specialists. Within each stratum, the first-phase sample of schools was selected systematically and with probabilities proportionate to the square root of the estimated number of teachers in the school. In the second phase of selection, a subsample of 1,202 schools was selected for the principals' survey from the 1,602 schools in the initial sample. The subsample was selected at rates that were inversely proportional to the probabilities of selection for the initial sample, thereby equalizing the within-stratum selection probabilities for the principals' survey to the extent feasible. The remaining 400 secondary schools in the first phase sample were asked to provide lists of music specialists and visual arts specialists only (i.e., they were not sampled to complete the school-level survey).</p>\n\n<p>Of the 1,202 secondary schools that were sampled for the school-level survey, 32 were found to be ineligible for the survey because they were closed, reconfigured, or did not include secondary grades.
