SPD provides monthly labor force data and, in addition,  supplies supplemental data on work experience, income, and noncash  benefits. Comprehensive work experience information is given on the  employment status, occupation, and industry of persons 15 years old  and older, as well as weeks worked and hours per week worked, reasons  for not working full-time, total income, and income components.  Information is available not only for persons currently in the labor  force but also for those who are outside the labor force. Variables  cover unemployed respondents' current desire for work, their past work  experience, and their intentions for job-seeking. SPD also provides  data covering nine noncash income sources: food stamps, school lunch  programs, employer-provided group health insurance plans,  employer-provided pension plans, personal health insurance, Medicaid,  Medicare, CHAMPUS or military health care, and energy assistance. Basic  demographic, social, and economic characteristics are supplied for each  member of the household surveyed, including age, sex, race, ethnic  origin, marital status, household relationship, education, and veteran  status. Limited data are provided on housing unit characteristics, such as number of units in structure and tenure."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing units"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personal finances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public assistance programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"socioeconomic status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"welfare reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"welfare services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work experience"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.

It is intended  as an experimental file to allow experienced user\ns to conduct  longitudinal analyses by matching to the SURVEY OF PROGRAM DYNAMICS  (SPD), 1997: BRIDGE SURVEY (ICPSR 2797) and the SURVEY OF INCOME AND  PROGRAM PARTICIPATION (SIPP) 1992 PANEL (ICPSR 2037) and 1993 PANEL  (ICPSR 2421) longitudinal files on the following keys at the person  level: SIPP panel number, sample unit identification number, person  number, and entry ID (SIPP_PNL, PP_ID, PP_PNUM, and PP_ENTRY). (2) The  1998 SPD file is a rectangular person-level file with household  variables included on each person record (there are no family-level  variables in the file). In contrast, the 1997 SPD Bridge file was  structured as a hierarchical file. (3) The database dictionary is  provided as an ASCII text file, and the codebook is provided by the  principal investigator as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. The  PDF file format was developed by Adobe Systems Incorporated and can be  accessed using PDF reader software, such as the Adobe Acrobat  Reader.
