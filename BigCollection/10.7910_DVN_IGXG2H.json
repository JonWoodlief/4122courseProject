The study also explored how the mental health of individual family members changes over time (using four longitudinal sequences with multiple cohorts), and how psychological well-being, changes within each generation, cultural environment and genetic endowment influence individual mental health.\r\n<br /><br />  Initiated in 1971, the study began with a sample of 345 multi-generation families followed at five timepoints occurring in 1971-1972, 1984-1985, 1988-1990, 1991,1994, and 1997. The project originally began as a cross-sectional study of three-generational families, examining the effects of intergenerational similarities and conflicts on mental health. Data were collected from 2,044 respondents at Time 1 (1971-1972), 1,331 respondents at Time 2 (1984-1985), 1,483 respondents at Time\r\n3 (1988); 1,734 respondents at Time 4 (1991), and 1,682 respondents at Time 5 (1994). At Time 4, Time 5, and Time 6, a new cohort of Generation 4 (great grandchildren) family members was added consisting of 116 females and 82 males and averaging 20 years of age. The generational cohorts followed comprised of a grandparent (later great-grandparent) generation (G1), a parent (later grandparent generation) generation (G2), an grandchild (later parent) generation (G3), and finally a great grandchild generation (G4). Variables assessed focused on demographic, sociological, psychological, health, and familial relations for grandparents (G1); parents (G2); grandchildren (G3); great grandchildren (G4).\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds numeric file data from the Time 1 survey and from the Time 2, Time 3, Time 4, and time 5 questionnaires for grandparents (G1), parents (G2), grandchildren (G3), and great grandchildren (G4) at Times 4 and 5. Data collected from each timepoint is restricted from use for six years after the time of data collection. Thus, data from Time 1 (1971-1972) became available for public use in 1976-1977, and data from Time 2 (1985) became available for public\r\nuse in 1991.
