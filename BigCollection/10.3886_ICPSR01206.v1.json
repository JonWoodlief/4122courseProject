The data include  alternative indicators of the variables discussed by Powell and  Whitten, and more recent election results that were\nnot contained in  the original dataset. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the  robustness of Powell and Whitten's initial findings. The data allow  for a near-replication of their work, as well as a retesting of their  basic model using different specifications, economic indicators, and  vote variables. The impact of aggregate economic indicators on vote  percentages for governing parties and the impact of political context  (e.g., one-party vs. multi-party government) on government accountability for economic performance are examined."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic indicators"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
