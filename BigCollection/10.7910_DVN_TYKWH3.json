Approximately 10-25% of these patients experience colonic diverticulitis during their lifetime. Right-sided diverticulosis is a rare condition in Western countries, but is common among Asian countries. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and treatment outcomes of our patients with right colon diverticulitis.\r\nMethods: The demographic and clinical data of 22 patients treated with diagnosis of cecum and right-sided colon diverticulitis between 2014 and 2017 were analyzed.   Hinchey staging was performed to patients according to radiological evaluation and clinical findings. Then proportions of demographic and clinical features of the patients according to Hinchey staging and its statistical significance were evaluated.\r\nResults: Our study included 22 patients who had right colon diverticulitis. Female/male ratio was 0.69. 68.1% of the patients were Hinckey stage I and 31.8% were Hinckey stage II, all of which were evaluated by tomography. Mostly Hinchey stage I diverticulitis was found in the right colon (66.7%) and Hinchey stage II diverticulitis in the cecum (57.1%). The mean age of Hinchey stage II patients was higher (63,57 years) and statistically significant (p < 0.05). Two patients had appendectomy and one had right hemicolectomy. Conservative treatment was given to other 19 patients. Mean time of hospitalization was 3,4 days. Four patients who received conservative treatment at two year follow-up had recurrence; No recurrence was seen in patients receiving surgical treatment.\r\nConclusions: Right colon diverticulitis is usually seen in solitary men in eastern societies under the age of 50. As a treatment option, conservative methods should be preferred especially in uncomplicated cases. Surgical treatment is usually used in the treatment of recurrent and complicated cases.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-11"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Right colon diverticulitis"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":" (MeSH)"},"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/ "}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hinchey classification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":" (MeSH)"},"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/ "}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Conservative treatment   "},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":" (MeSH)"},"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/ "}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The region where colonic diverticulitis is infrequent: Right colon diverticulitis\r\n"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"url"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1bTgNs-rSexGuzqZMxkoNsm_I3kfYGY1Z"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bTgNs-rSexGuzqZMxkoNsm_I3kfYGY1Z"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Emergency Medicine International\r\nManuscript Number 8545840 (Research Article)\r\n(Under Review)"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Destek, Sabahattin"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-10"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Right colon diverticulitis Exel Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":141622,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":3220751,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/TYKWH3/U5MDMN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TYKWH3/U5MDMN","filename":"Right colon diverticulitis Exel Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":213,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165c5586a13-b72e04e2da06","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:SKLEspXHc26ZCrDoq2BeBQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9bc14aeff44b1ec0bada040ae601392a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9bc14aeff44b1ec0bada040ae601392a"}}},{"label":"Tables.docx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":141622,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":3220750,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/TYKWH3/L13JW3","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TYKWH3/L13JW3","filename":"Tables.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":19340,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165c5580eea-f95e7495b9ec","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2941d235ff18622f5ef92c4a3608ab1b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2941d235ff18622f5ef92c4a3608ab1b"}}},{"description":"full text","label":"The region where colonic diverticulitis is infrequent Right colon diverticulitis.docx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":141622,"categories":["Documentation","Manuscript"],"dataFile":{"id":3220752,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/TYKWH3/ESB8ZR","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TYKWH3/ESB8ZR","filename":"The region where colonic diverticulitis is infrequent Right colon diverticulitis.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":577282,"description":"full text","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165c5566b6d-77ec0688ecde","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"05a221be70321dd654d30e8e3809da10","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"05a221be70321dd654d30e8e3809da10"}}}]}}}
