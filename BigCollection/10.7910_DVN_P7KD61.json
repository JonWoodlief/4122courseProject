The purpose of the survey is to evaluate the cost and benefits of a niche market development for NUS products as a means of agricultural biodiversity conservation instrument. To this end, data on income, family size, area of yielding, production and processing costs, quantity sold and bottlenecks in selling  have been collected for Finger millet, Taro, Horse gram and Anadi rice products and niche products. The dat\naset is organized as follows: Household's general information, Finger millet data, Anadi rice data, Taro data and Horse gram data. Stratified random sampling selecting from those farmers that yield at least two of the mentioned NUS. Sample intensity of the 30% for each village.
