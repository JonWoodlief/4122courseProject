The  study was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and opinions  about the 2000 presidential election. Respondents were asked whether  they participated in the last presidential election on November 7,  2000, and whom they voted for. They also gave their opinions of both  presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor  George W. Bush, their running mates, the Democratic Party vice  presidential candidate Joe Lieberman and the Republican Party vice  presidential candidate Dick Cheney, and the respective  parties. Those polled were asked whether Bush and Gore would be able  to lea\nd the country effectively and whether they would bring together  or divide different groups of Americans. The survey queried  respondents on the way the Bush and Gore campaigns were handling the  uncertain outcome of the election, the legitimacy of the election, the  electoral college, the accuracy of Florida's vote count, and the  effects of the presidential election controversy. Respondents were  asked whom voters in Florida intended to vote for, whether one of the  candidates should concede, and when the outcome would finally be  resolved. Additional questions focused on the United States Supreme  Court and its involvement in the election, Cheney's health condition,  partisanship in Congress, and the situation in the national  economy. Respondents also indicated whether Bush was right in starting  to form his administration before the court cases were  resolved. Background information on respondents includes age, gender,  education, race/ethnic identity, voter registration, political party  affiliation, political orientation, marital status, children in the household, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
