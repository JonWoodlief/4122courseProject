Studies examining these questions often focus on the role of economic or partisan interests, and how they influence the preferences decision-makers who are subject to the electoral institutions and pressures of their constituents. Less attention has been paid to how the preferences of other influential, unelected, actors influence state behavior. I examine the influence of one such group by looking at how American military leaders shape decisions on American military spending and force structure, \r\nwhile also examining how these decisions have been affected by changes to the institutions governing civil-military relations.  Results indicate that military leaders occupying key positions can influence defense spending priorities in favor of their respective branches. Results also suggest the influence of military leaders has changed over time, and is conditional upon the institutions governing the relationships between civilian decision-makers and military leaders.
