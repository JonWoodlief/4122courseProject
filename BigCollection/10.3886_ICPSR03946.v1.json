Residents of Maryland  were asked for their opinions on the job performance of Governor Bob  Ehrlich and the condition of the Maryland economy. Those polled were  asked what they believed the biggest problem facing Maryland was today,  who they trusted to do a better job coping with the problems the state  faced, and what Governor Ehrlich's biggest accomplishment in his first  year was. Respondents were queried on whether they felt Senator Barbara  Mikulski deserved to be re-elected in the year's United States Senate  election, which political party they were leaning toward, whom they  would vote for in the 2004 Democratic presidential primary, whether they  voted in the 2002 Maryland gubernatorial election, and whom they voted  for (Bob Ehrlich or Kathleen Kennedy Townsend). Further questions  queried what steps respondents would find acceptable to deal with the  state's budget shortfall and what kind of tax increase would be the best  if the legislature decided to raise taxes to balance the budget.  Additional questions focused on whether respondents would favor allowing  slot-machine gambling at horse-racing tracks or other places in  Maryland, whether they would favor legalizing casino gambling in  Maryland, and whether they would play if there were slot machines in  Maryland. Opinions were also solicited on corruption in state government  and a state law that would allow gay and lesbian couples to enter into  civil unions, giving them some of the legal rights of married couples.  Background variables include political orientation, education,  ethnicity, household income, and whether the respondent was registered to vote."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ehrlich, Bob"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government corruption"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gubernatorial elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legalized gambling"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Mikulski, Barbara"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"taxes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
