The levels are organized in a hierarchy, with the items in each level nested in the higher-level regions that contain it (e.g., land parcels in census geographies). This is coordinated via variables that act as unique identifiers at each level. As a composite, the database is intended to facilitate aggregate calculations across levels of the hierarchy and analyses of data from different sources that reference the same geographical units. In particular, the database makes it possible to connect data sets generated by the City of Boston with census geographies and data."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Boston"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"geographical infrastructure"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tracts"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"blocks"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"groups"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"geographies"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"boundaries"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parcels"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Boston Area Research Initiative"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.bostonarearesearchinitiative.net"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Boston Area Research Initiative, BARI"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-10-02"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This documentation file details pertinent information associated with all of the files and content within the 2018 Geographical Infrastructure for the City of Boston dataset.
