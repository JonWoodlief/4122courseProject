There were five goals associated with designing and creating the  Florida Criminal Justice Workforce Research Information System: (1) to  extract data from two transaction management information systems,  which could then be used by researchers to describe and analyze the  workforce that administers justice in Florida, (2) to pilot test the  concept of developing a new research information source from existing  data systems, (3) to forge partnerships with diverse criminal justice  agencies having a mutual need to understand their respective  workforces, (4) to design research files to enable internal and  external researchers to utilize the data for analytical purposes, and  (5) to describe the methodology used to create the workforce  information system in sufficient detail to enable other states to  replicate the process and develop their own criminal justice workforce  research databases. The project was jointly conceived, designed, and  completed by two state-level criminal justice agencies with diverse  missions and responsibilities: the Florida Department of Law  Enforcement (FDLE) and the Florida Department of Corrections  (FDC). Data were extracted from two personnel management systems: the  Automated Transaction Management System (ATMS) operated by the Florida  Department of Law Enforcement, which contains data on all certified  law enforcement, correctional, and correctional probation officers in  Florida (Part 1), and the Cooperative Personnel Employment System  (COPES) operated by the Department of Management Services, which  contains data on all state employees (Part 2).
