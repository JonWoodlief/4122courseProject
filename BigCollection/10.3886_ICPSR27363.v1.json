CHS 2007 covered the following health topics: general health status, health care access, dental care, preventive counseling, mental health, cardiovascular health, diabetes, asthma, physical activity, nutrition, smoking, second-hand smoke, child care, cancer screening, HIV, sexual behavior, alcohol use, and immunizations. Interviews were completed in English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), as well as multiple other languages, according to the preference of the respondent. The interviews were conducted by Baruch Survey Research Unit between March and November, 2007. The sample was geo-stratified to collect interviews from 42 United Hospital Fund (UHF) areas in New York City. Weights were constructed at the UHF-level to allow the sample to provide neighborhood-level estimations of both individual adults and of households in New York City. The margin of sampling error for the complete set of weighted data is +/-1.44 percent for citywide household estimations, and +/-1.56 percent for citywide individual-level estimations. A core group of demographic variables are included to facilitate weighting and comparisons among different groups of New Yorkers. These demographic variables include gender, age, marital status, employment status, race, income, and educational attainment."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"n/a"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The telephone sample was provided by MSG-Genesys, Inc. according to Baruch's specifications.

The survey instrument was composed of questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and other established national surveys, plus a small number of questions to address the unique needs of the DoHMH. Trustforte Translation Services translated the final questionnaire into Spanish. Both English and Spanish were then programmed into a CATI instrument. The DoHMH translated the instrument into Russian and Chinese translations. Interviews in other languages, were conducted using live translation services provided by Language Line Services. Calls were staggered over times of the day and days of the week to maximize the chance of making contact with potential respondents. The CATI program randomly selected an adult to be interviewe\nd, distinguishing by sex and age (for example, asking for the \"second-oldest female\").
