The study focused on families who adopted a Korean-American child  through Holt International Children's Services from 1970 to 1980. The  principal investigator hoped to identify the effects of large-scale  changes in family environment on children's outcomes using data on  adults who were adopted in infancy. Korean-American adoptees placed  through Holt International Children's Services had been quasi-randomly  assigned to these families in infancy using a queuing (first-come,  first-served) policy. One adoptive parent from each family was  surveyed, as well as a small subset of adult adoptees, and each case  represented an adopted or non-adopted child in the family. Adoptive  parents were asked to give their age, sex, marital status, occupation,  education level, household income, height, weight, tobacco and alcohol  usage, and the number of children they had. Adoptive parents also  gave information on their adopted and non-adopted children's age, sex,  marital status, education level, income, weight, height, undergraduate  institution, number of children, and whether their children smoked,  drank alcohol, or had asthma. For adopted children, parents gave the  arrival age of the child and whether the child was adopted through  Holt International. Adoptive parents also indicated whether they were  aware of and had used services such as workshops and referral services  offered by Holt. Since the survey relied on parent reports of their  adult children's outcomes, surveys were also sent to a small subset of  adoptees. Their surveys included the same questions asked of their  adoptive parents, as well as the adoptee's value of assets, religion,  and frequency of religious attendance. The study also contained  information on adoptees' birth parents obtained from Holt  International's administrative records and constructed variables that  analyzed household composition, population characteristics, and the education and health status of the adoptive family."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adopted children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adoption"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adoptive parents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Asian Americans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational background"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational trends"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family background"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family size"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household composition"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AERA I.

For this reason, variable names were shortened to a length of  eight characters. (2) Value labels for unknown codes were added in  several variables. (3) To protect respondent confidentiality, employer  names were removed from values in the variable OCCCURRE. (4) Values  relating to the birth years of child respondents in variable YEARBIRT  were transferred to variable CHILDBYE, per instructions from the  principal investigator. (5) Variables GENDER through IND_TR_H contain  survey responses from child respondents. (6) The formats of several  variables were adjusted to fit the width of the values present in  them. (7) Variables MOTHERSY, BIRTHM_A, and BIRTHM_B were converted  from character to numeric. (8) According to the principal  investigator, the variable WEIGHTER was the inverse of the estimated  probability of response from a probit of response on parental  characteristics. (9) Because of the anonymity of the mail-in surveys,  31 of the child respondents were unable to be linked with their  original families. For this reason, 31 records were missing data on  the child's adoptive parents and likely contain duplicate information  about that child in another record.
