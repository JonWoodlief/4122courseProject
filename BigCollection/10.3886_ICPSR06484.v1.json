Self-administered questionnaires were  completed by 835 male inmates in six correctional facilities and 1,663  male and female students from ten inner-city high schools in  California, Illinois, Louisiana, and New Jersey. Data collection took  place during January through April of 1991. To maximize response  rates, inducements of five dollars were offered to the inmates,  Spanish-language versions of the questionnaire were provided to  inmates who preferred them, and personal interviews were conducted  with inmates whose reading skills were less than sufficient to  complete the questionnaire on their own. In four schools, principals  permitted the inducements to be offered to students to participate in  the study. As with the inmate survey, a Spanish-language version of  the questionnaire was provided to students who preferred it. The  questionnaires covered roughly the same core topics for both inmates  and students. Items included questions on sociodemographic  characteristics, school experiences, gun ownership, gun use for  several types of firearms, gun acquisition patterns, gun-carrying  habits, use of other weapons, gang membership and gang activities,  self-reported criminal histories, victimization patterns, drug use,  alcohol use, and attitudes concerning guns, crime, and violence.

While evidence documenting the extent of youth violence is abundant,  the available research evidence dealing with juveniles, guns, and  violence has left many important questions unanswered, for which this  data collection attempts to provide information. Concerning violence  on the streets, how many street juveniles, of what description, own,  carry, or use firearms on a routine basis? Where and how are their  firearms obtained? What empirical relationships can be discerned  between firearms behaviors and involvement in crime, gangs, or the  drug trade?  Concerning juvenile violence in the schools, how  prevalent is gun ownership, carrying, and use among students in  inner-city schools? Who are the inner-city victims of youthful gun  viole\nnce? Regarding current beliefs about gangs, drugs, and guns, how  much is true and how much is modern urban myth? If guns are indeed  prevalent among youth, whether they are gang members or not, what  kinds of guns do the youths possess?

Self-administered questionnaires  were completed by 835 male inmates in six correctional facilities and  1,663 male and female students from ten inner-city high schools in the  United States. Data collection took place during January through April  of 1991. Respondents were told that the research sought information  about what they knew about guns in their neighborhoods and peer  groups, as well as information about their personal knowledge and  experience. In all cases, students and inmates were assured that their  participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous. Respondents  were also asked to sign a form attesting that they understood the  subject of the study and that their participation was entirely  voluntary. For the inmate survey, administrators announced the study  to wards in each of the smaller facilities' dormitories and to those  in about half of the larger facilities' dormitories. To maximize  response rates, inducements of five dollars were offered to the  inmates, Spanish-language versions of the questionnaire were provided  to inmates who preferred them, and personal interviews were conducted  with inmates whose reading skills were less than sufficient to  complete the questionnaire on their own.
