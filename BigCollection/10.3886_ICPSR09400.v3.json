Court records and relevant police reports for drunk-driving  cases drawn from the greater metropolitan areas of Boston, Denver, and  Los Angeles were compiled to produce this data collection. Cases were  selected to include roughly equal proportions of guilty pleas, guilty  verdicts, and not-guilty verdicts. DWI cases were compared on the  quality and quantity of evidence concerning the suspect's behavior,  with the evidence coming from any mention of 20 standard visual  detection cues prior to the stop, 13 attributes of general appearance  and behavior immediately after the stop, and the results of as many as  7 field sobriety tests. Questions concerned driving-under-the-influence  cues (scoring sheet), observed traffic violations and actual traffic  accidents, the verdict, DWI history, whether the stop resulted from  an accident, whether the attorney was public or private, and sanctions  that followed the verdict. Also included were demographic questions on age, sex, and ethnicity."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arrests"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"court cases"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"driving under the influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pleas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"verdicts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
