Some of these actors are more powerful than others and can therefore have a considerable effect on decision-making. In this article, we seek to provide a structural and institutional explanation for these power differentials in policy networks and support the explanation with empirical evidence. We use a dyadic measure of influence reputation as a proxy for power, and posit that influence reputation over the political outcome is related to vertical integration into the political system by means of formal decision-making authority, and to horizontal integration by means of being well-embedded into the policy network."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ingold, Karin, Leifeld, Philip: Structural and Institutional Determinants of Influence Reputation:  A Comparison of Collaborative and Adversarial Policy Networks in Decision Making and Implementation .
