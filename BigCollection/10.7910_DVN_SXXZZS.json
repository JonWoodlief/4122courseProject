We sought to explore LARC utilization patterns as well as factors associated with LARC initiation by women seeking contraception in rural Guatemala from a program working to reduce contraception access barriers.\r\nStudy Design:  We analyzed data from a program that provides family planning in six remote, primarily indigenous, villages in Guatemala with limited access to alternative health services.  Methods are free and delivered directly within villages by culturally competent providers.  We conducted a retrospective chart review of all 288 women who initiated a contraceptive method over a 16-month period and conducted a logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (OR) for predictors of LARC uptake.  \r\nResults:  Overall 79.2% of women elected a LARC method.  More than half of women (49.8%) switched to LARC from short-acting hormonal methods.  In the univariate analysis prior use of short-acting method (p=0.014), number of prior methods (p=0.049), and current contraceptive use (p<0.01) were significantly associated with choosing a LARC.  In the logistic regression model current use of contraception remained significant (OR 3.29, 95% CI 1.67-8.04).  Report of abnormal bleeding or other side effects from prior short-acting method use did not predict LARC uptake (p=0.82 and p=0.079).\r\nConclusions: Most women in this marginalized population opted for a LARC method. \r\nImplications:  Low utilization of LARCs may be related to service delivery factors. Further research is needed to validate these conclusions prospectively and in less selected populations. \r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-06-04"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Austad, Kirsten"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-06-04"}]}},"files":[{"label":"LARC data labeled stata.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":137384,"dataFile":{"id":3172632,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/SXXZZS/HBW0V6","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SXXZZS/HBW0V6","filename":"LARC data labeled stata.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":220960,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:163cba345f9-c9fda46c045b","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:azO+g5mgP/+qs7izwX1IGw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a0c656e2b6c11b691e702ec850920ea6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a0c656e2b6c11b691e702ec850920ea6"}}}]}}}
