Respondents were asked if they smoked   or used chewing tobacco or snuff, or had in the past. If so, they were   questioned as to when they started, how much they smoked, chewed, or   snuffed during the last month, where they bought cigarettes, which   brand of cigarettes, chewing tobacco, or snuff they usually bought, how   many times they tried to stop these habits, and what was the longest   time they stopped smoking cigarettes since they started smoking   regularly. Nonsmokers were asked if they thought they might start   smoking, if they had experimented with cigarette smoking, if they had   ever been offered a cigarette, and how difficult it would be to obtain   tobacco if they wanted to. The survey asked respondents if any of their   household members, teachers, or friends smoked, if they had heard   anything about the health risks of tobacco use on television, radio, or   in newspapers or magazines, and if they believed that chewing tobacco   or using snuff causes cancer. Attitudes toward tobacco use were also   probed with questions such as whether respondents disliked being around   people who smoked, whether they believed it was safe to smoke for only   a year or two, if they preferred to date people who didn't smoke, if   they thought they could stop smoking any time they wanted to, whether   they thought their friends approved or disapproved of their smoking,   chewing, or snuffing, and if they thought their parents would mind if   they smoked when they were older. Respondents were also asked if they   believed there was any harm in having an occasional cigarette, and if   they believed smoking helps people to relax, to keep down their weight,   and to reduce boredom and stress. In addition to questions about   tobacco use, the survey queried respondents about their attitudes   regarding seat belts, fitness, alcohol, marijuana, drugs in general,   school, and diet. They were also asked whether, during the last year,   they had been in an accident or physical fight, had been in a car with   a drunk driver, or had ridden on a motorcycle, and how often they had   trouble going to sleep, felt unhappy or depressed, felt hopeless about   the future, felt nervous or tense, or worried too much. Demographic and   socioeconomic information provided in the data file includes   respondents' race, education, and geographic region, reference persons'   race, education, occupation, and marital status, presence of parent(s)   or other adult relative in household, family income, and education of  the adult."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"driving under the influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drugs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marijuana"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sleep"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"smoking"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"stress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teenagers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tobacco products"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tobacco use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
