Respondents were\nasked whether they supported or   opposed a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal   budget, even if it meant cuts in federal spending on Social Security   or an increase in federal income taxes. Respondents were polled on   whether they approved or disapproved of the way President Bill   Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and House Speaker Newt   Gingrich handled the balanced budget amendment issue, whether   respondents supported or opposed most of the items in the Republican   Party's \"Contract with America,\" and whether the Senate's rejection   of the balanced budget amendment was a setback for the Republicans.   Views were also sought on whether the balanced budget amendment would   have led to cuts in Social Security, whether passing a balanced   budget amendment or protecting Social Security was more important,   whether respondents would be more or less likely to vote for a state   senator who voted against the balanced budget amendment, and the   importance of this issue in their vote.
