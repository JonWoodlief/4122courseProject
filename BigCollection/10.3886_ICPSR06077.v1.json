Respondents were asked to comment on what   they thought was the most important problem facing the country, and to   give their approval rating of George Bush with respect to his handling   of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy. Questions were   posed regarding respondents' vote intentions for the 1992 presidential   election, their opinions of potential 1992 presidential candidates, the   likelihood of their voting in either a Republican or Democratic   presidential primary or caucus, their candidate preferences for the   Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, and issues   presidential candidates should emphasize. Those surveyed were asked   about the concern of the presidential candidates for the needs and   probl\nems of Black people, the amount of attention the government had   given to Blacks and other minorities, the best way for Blacks to gain   their rights, and the impact of government programs in the 1960s on   poor people. Respondents were queried regarding race relations in the   United States, the state of race relations compared to ten years ago,   Bush's handling of race relations, and the amount of progress that had   been made since the 1960s to conquer racial discrimination. Questions   pertaining to the Rodney King trial focused on the jury's verdict   acquitting the Los Angeles policemen, whether the videotape of the   beating showed enough for the respondent to make a judgment regarding   the guilt of the policemen, who was to blame for the riots in Los   Angeles, the effect of the riots on Blacks, and the reactions of Bush,   Bill Clinton, and Ross Perot to the riots. Those surveyed were also   asked whether Bush, Clinton, or Perot could best handle race relations,   improve education, create job opportunities, ensure law and order,   bring people of different races together, and increase hope that things   could get better. Additional questions concerned ways to reduce racial   tension and prevent riots, and the amount of money that should be spent   on areas such as improving conditions for Blacks, assisting the poor,   and funding welfare. Background information on respondents includes   sex, age, race, education, religious preference, family income,  political orientation, and party preference."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
