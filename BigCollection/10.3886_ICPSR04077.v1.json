The waiver laws were enacted to ensure that a youth who was  unwilling to comply with treatment and/or committed a serious offense  would have a serious consequence to his/her action and, therefore,  would be processed in the adult system. As a result of the  legislation, four pathways of court processing emerged which created  four groups of youths to study: at-risk of waiver (not waived),  waiver, legislative waiver, and reverse waver. A variety of data  sources in both the juvenile and adult systems were triangulated to  obtain the necessary information to accurately describe the youths  involved. The triangulation of data from multiple file sources  happened in a variety of formats (automated, hardcopy, and electronic  files) from a variety of agencies to compare and contrast youths  processed in the juvenile and adult systems.

The waiver laws were  enacted to ensure that a youth who was unwilling to comply with  treatment and/or committed a serious offense would have a serious  consequence to his/her action and, therefore, would be processed in  the adult system. This research project set out to pursue the  following three objectives: (1) to develop prediction models of waiver  by asking whether the decision to waive or reverse waive was based on  the five legislative criteria for waiver and whether the waiver group  could be predicted from the legislative criteria or whether there were  other factors more predictive, (2) to create profiles of the youths in  each waiver category by asking who was being waived in Maryland and  what their characteristics were, and (3) to compare 1990-1992  overrepresentation results to 1998-1999 data for various decision  points and extension into the adult system by asking whether the  waiver further exacerbated an already disproportionate minority system."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"As a result of the legislation, four pathways of  court processing emerged which created four groups of youths to study:  at-risk of waiver (not waived), waiver, legislative waiver, and  reverse waiver. The at-risk and reverse waiver youths were processed  in the juvenile justice system, and the waiver and legislative waiver  youths were processed in the adult system. During 1998, 599 youths  housed in Maryland's secure commitment facilities created the  population of at-risk youths for thi\ns study. There were 1,200  legislatively waived youths, of whom only 66 could be identified by  the Division of Corrections (DOC) because they were under 18 at the  time of admission (October 1998 to March 1999). The reverse waiver  group was randomly selected from those identified as being returned to  the juvenile justice system. A variety of data sources in both the  juvenile and adult systems were triangulated to obtain the necessary  information to accurately describe the youths involved. The  triangulation of data from multiple file sources happened in a variety  of formats (automated data sets, hardcopy files, and electronic files)  from a variety of agencies to compare and contrast youths processed in  the juvenile and adult systems. Triangulation is the process of  examining a phenomenon from varied perspectives to verify or support  the findings of a study. For example, to determine if a youth had  delinquent peers, it was not sufficient to read the Department of  Juvenile Justice (DJJ) file and see if the case worker reported  delinquent peers. Triangulation included reviewing the parental  summary of the youth's activities in the home and reviewing the court  files to determine if the youth had co-defendants. The five  legislative criteria (age, mental and physical condition, amenability  to treatment, crime seriousness, and public safety) plus extra-legal  data were used as a framework to profile the youths in this  study.
