Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way Barack Obama was handling his job as president, the economy, the war in Afghanistan, health care, and the threat of terrorism. Respondents were queried on what they thought was the most important problem facing the United States, how they would rate the condition of the national economy, whether they thought the economy was getting better or worse, and whether they approved of the way that the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress were handling health care. Respondents were also asked whether they thought health care reform was going too far in trying to provide health insurance to as many Americans as possible, in trying to control cost, and in trying to regulate the health insurance industry. Information was collected on whether respondents' thought that Guantanamo Prison should continue to operate, whether they favored or opposed mandatory testing of students in public schools each year to determine how well the school is educating students, whether they thought students should be required to learn a foreign language in order to graduate from high school, and whether they thought that teachers in public schools were paid too much, too little, or just the right amount. Respondents were asked whether they had children that attended school, what type of school their children attended, what grade they would give to the quality of their children's education, whether they thought their children's education was better or worse than the education they received. Information was collected on how much respondents' children studied, whether they thought that it was important for their children's school curriculum to include arts, music and physical education, whether they thought that their children would attend college, and whether they\nthought that their children's school was properly preparing them for college. Respondents were also asked to rate the United States on its ability to protect the country from terrorist attacks, how likely they thought it was that there would be another terrorist attack in the United States within the next few months, whether they were afraid of flying, whether they thought that it was justified for people of certain racial or ethnic groups to be subjected to additional security checks at airports, and whether they thought that X-ray machines should be used to scan the bodies of travelers at airports. Finally respondents were asked a number of miscellaneous questions including what their New Year's resolution was, what their favorite season was, who they thought was the top athletic role model, who they thought was the most important American contributor to literature, what place and time period they would most like to return to, and how often they fly. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, marital status, education level, household income, military service, religious preference, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, and voter registration status."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Afghanistan
