The data were collected in an   effort to construct and apply survey indicators of economic well-being   and motivation, and to link changes in them to trends in the American   economy. The work aims at measuring economic welfare, its dimensions,   its situational (objective) and psychological (subjective) bases, and   its consequences for economic behavior and for people's orientation  to the larger social system. The focus is on the mutual interdependence   of people and the economy. Consideration is given to both the problem   of how people influence the economy and the impact of economic changes   on people's well-being, their sense of equity and fairness, and their   orientation toward societal institutions and the political system.  Part 1 data are comprised of data collected in April-May 1971, from a   relatively homogeneous sample of young families in Detroit and Baltimore,   Part 2 data are from the Survey Research Center's Omnibus Survey, Spring   1972, Part 3 data are from the Omnibus Survey, Fall 1973, and Part 4  data are from the Omnibus Survey, Fall 1974. Respondents were asked  about their expectations concerning changes in their income, their  feelings about the equity of their income renumeration in comparison   with that of others, and their beliefs about which factors should   determine a fair amount of pay. Additional items explored respondents'   attitudes toward women's participation in the labor force, and work.  Information was also elicited about respondents' satisfaction with   their job, standard of living, and amount in savings, and how their  current standard of living matched past expectations. Various personal   trust, control, and achievement items are also included. The data   collection also contains the traditional series of Economic Behavior   Program questions on consumer attitudes and expectations, price changes,   unemployment, and consumer products satisfaction. Demographic variables   describe age, sex, race, marital status, education, occupation, income,  number of children, religion, and party identification."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"inflation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor force"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"standard of living"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.B.

The overall\nsampling rate for housing units was frequently   about one in 32,000. Probability selection was enforced at all stages   of sampling. In a last stage of sampling, one respondent aged 18 and   older was selected from among eligible household members. The sample   was designed to yield approximately 1,500 interviews.
