Those queried were asked whether they viewed any of that  testimony and what they believed the impact of the testimony would  be. Respondents were asked whether they thought the Senate should  censure or officially reprimand Clinton, vote to remove him from  office, or allow him to remain in office. Additional topics covered  whether the Senate's impeachment debates should be open or closed to  the public, whether Clinton should face criminal charges for his  actions, who was to blame, whether the public was tired of hearing  about the impeachment, and whether the final vote would be based on  facts or on partisan politics. Background information on respondents  includes age, race, sex, political party, political orientation, and education."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
