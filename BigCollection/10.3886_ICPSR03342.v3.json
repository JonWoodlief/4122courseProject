Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, the economy, international affairs, and environmental issues. Those queried also expressed their opinions on the economy, its impact on the country, and how concerns about the economy might affect respondents' spending habits. Other questions focused on Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut and its consequences, and Bush's ability to deal with crises. Respondents' views were elicited on the United States spy plane collision with a Chinese F-8 fighter jet on April 1, 2001, and the relationships between the United States and China. In addition, respondents were asked to give their views on the importance of Canada to United States citizens, and vice-versa, and on the relationship between Canada and the United States. A series of questions focused on the responsibility of dog owners toward the public as far as the law is concerned regarding their dogs' behavior.
