We argue that the extent to which a firm’s network affects its OFDI is contingent upon both structural and relational network embeddedness. We conducted a survey to test our hypothesises.We targeted executive managers of middle and high seniority (C-suite level) to make sure respondents have good knowledge about OFDI. All executive managers have at least three years of management experience and accumulated rich information in their management positions (Kumar et al., 1993). The survey was conducted in 2013 through three channels: on-line survey supported by a third-party research agent; visits of the executive managers in their companies; and fact-to-face talks to executive managers who enrolled in the Executive MBA training programme. A total of 357 firms were targeted and 194 firms provided valid data, yielding a valid response rate of 54.3%.
