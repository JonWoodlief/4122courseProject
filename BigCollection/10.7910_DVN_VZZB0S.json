Acquisition  is   one   of   the   most    important functions   of a  library   as  the  worth of a library   can   well  be judged    by  the materials it acquires.    Hence a sound   acquisition policy  is musttor   a library.\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries are  encountering  for  new   resources,  which are\r\n\r\n''Born digital\" and  have  no print   or analogue equivalent  - they    exist  only  in digital form.   The  introduction   of  digital technologies into   the  processes  of production,   distribution   &  storage of  information  challenges  the   capacity and   ability    of  libraries  &   other   cultural   institutions    to  carry out   their responsibility   for  preservation.     The  purpose   of preservation   is  to  ensure protection  of information  of enduring value for access   by present    and  future generations.    Libraries,  traditionally have   assumed   the   responsibility   for preserving  information,   face   technical, Organizational resource,  and   legal challenges in responding  to the new  demands  for digital preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigitization is  a major  issue   for preservation  managers  in libraries.    Digital  surrogates  can   assist   in   deflecting  demand   away   from handling  Originals (provided high-quality  images   are  readily   available),  not only  for  detailed  analysis  of  the  items    but   also  for  browsing.     Still  many librarians from   western  countries  are  of the  opinion that  digitization should not  be allowed to detract   from  traditional conservation efforts to preserve  the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n1 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Librarian as a Researcher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLibrarians are  highly   skilled   in  the  research process  and possess     a  unique    knowledge  of  the     breadth  and   depth    of  information resources  in   various subject    specialties.    We  believe that   librarians  will increasingly   become  members   of  research  and   development   teams.     By facilitating  access   to  information  -  finding   it,  delivering, summarizing  it  - librarians will  move   to  the  beginning  of  the  information production  cycle, playing   a more  substantial  role in  the information  creation process.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Librarian as  Organizer and  Publisher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  the  digital library environment,  the  traditional roles  of publishers  as information packagers  and  information distribution facilitators and  the  traditional  role  of libraries as  storehouses  of information  will be de• emphasized.      As   universities, regional research centers, laboratories, corporations, and  professional  societies  develop  their   otvn   depositories  of information  and  make   them  available to  the  world's networks,  they  take  on the  publisher's   and   the  library's traditional roles.   These entities,  in   this function,  have   the  potential  of  diminishing   the  role  of  traditional libraries and  commercial publishers if:\r\n(1) Faculty    tenure     guidelines    more     solidly     support    publications through\tthese   entities   in  electronic format,    returning  intellectual ownership  of research output   to their  faculty   members;\r\n(2) University and  scholarly Presses  become activists  in  the  electronic publishing revolution;\r\n\r\n2 \r\n(3)Everything   possible   is   done   to  support  fairly-prices democratic access   to information  while supporting  intellectual  copyright; and most  importantly,\r\n(4)Information    access  and  delivery systems  are  designed  to meet   the consumers'\tneeds.     To meet   the  consumers'   needs,    digital library systems\tmust    be  dependable; must    be  reasonably  priced;  must have  powerful,  easy-to-use, intelligent search engines; must   have attractive  user  interfaces; must   allow the  consumer  to inspect    the \"product\" before buying; and  must   allow access   from,   and  delivery to, the  consumer's workstation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEditors, faculty, and  librarians will  have   important roles as       organizers, and   reviewers, guardians  of  intellectual  property  in   the digital libraries of  the  future.      Copyright  is  a  major   issue   for  the  digital library   and   will  be  until   new   copyright  Jaw  adequately  addresses  various information  formats.     Librarians  will  take   part   in   the   formation   of  new copyright Jaw and  in  the  application of the Jawin the  digital library.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Librarian As  a Member of the Digital Library Design Team\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that  librarians must    become more  involved in the  design   and  application of information technology initiatives.  Librarians must    collaborate with   computer  and   information  scientists   in  the  design, organization, development,   and  maintenance   of  digital library   repositories, interfaces, and  networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo   provide   the    scholars   of   the    future     efficient   and intelligent  access   to  the  world's knowledge is  a formidable  task.    Librarians\r\n\r\n\r\n3 \r\nmust    be  active participants   in   the  process   because   they   are   experts    as accessing  the  world's information resources  today.   Their areas of expertise are  different  than   the  computer  and  information  scientists.     The librarian 's knowledge  of  the   world's information  resources  and   their   knowledge  and experience  in   directing   users    to   information    will   be   essential   in    the development  and  maintenance  of the  digital library's information access  and delivery systems.      The  librarian can   contribute   to  information   selection, ACQUISITION,organization as  well as  design of the  search engine and  user interface,\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermine  the  appropriate purpose  of our  program  based   on  the  needs   of our library  and  audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n}.,,\tBecome  more   aware of  the  issues,    needs   and   concerns  of people   with disabilities in accessing electronic resources\r\n}.,,      Develop library   services accessible  to a  wide  range   of  users   by  applying\r\n\r\nuniversal design  principles.\r\n\r\n}.,,\t\tUnderstand    the    primary    types     of   adaptive    technology   and     their implications  for people   with  disabilities\r\n}.,,\tPlan  and  implement  adaptive technology capabilities for library  computer workstations.\r\n}.,,\tLearn  universal  design principles  for  developing  World lVide  Web  and other  electronic resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries play   an   important   role   in   ensunng   equitable access   to information  for  all  members   of  our  society.   In  addition. federal \r\nlegislation mandates   that  public   institutions,   including    libraries, provide accommodations  for people   with  disabilities so that  they  can  utilize the  same services and  resources as other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n>-     Making Library Resources Accessible to People with  Disabilities\r\n>   Working Together: People with  Disabilities and  Computer Technology\r\n>   Meet   the   Speakers  in  the   Videotape:    Working Together: People with\r\n\r\nDisabilities and  Computer Technology\r\n>    World I.Vide Access:  Accessible  Web Design\r\n>   Meet  the  Speakers  in  the  Videotape: World Wide Access\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic  Resources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistoricelly  libraries  have   been   committed   to  providing  equal access    to  information   to  their   constituents,    whether   they   be  the  general public,   the  students   and  faculty   of a college, or the  employees  of a business. The rapid  development  of electronic information  resources  has   changed  the physical   and   service  features  of  our  libraries.    Throughout  this   change, many   Iibreries have   embraced  a goal  of  making    their   resources  easier   to access.   The  development   of sophisticated  multimedia  electronic and   World Wide   Web  resources  are  seen     as  methods   of  extending   the  reach   of  the library.     Increasingly, however,  these   resources  are  not   fully   accessible to people   with  some   types   of disabilities.  For example, screen   reader  software with  a  speech   synthesizer   used   by  a patron    who  is  blind   cannot   interpret tables, graphics,  or video clips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Library Access   Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs   more   information   is   delivered using    computer   and network   technologies,  libraries  play    an   increasingly   important   role   in ensuring   access    for   all   people    to   Internet   and    electronic  information resources.       In    making     libreries  and    electronic   resources   accessible, principles  of universal design should   be employed.\r\nAccess   to computing  resources  for people   with  disabilities in your   Iibrery   involves  two  issues:     l .Access   to  the  computers   themselves and     2.Access   to  the   electronic resources.      Electronic  resources  include operational  programs   such    as   word processors   and    spreadsheets    and information   resources    such    as   encyclopedias  and    databases  available\r\nthrough local  and  networked  computer  systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nStaff\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople who  greet   and  interact  with  patrons  have   a great \r\n\r\nimpact   on  their  success   in  using  library  resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•!•     Training\r\n\r\n•!•    Services awareness\r\n\r\n•!•    Largeprint  name   badges\r\n\r\n•!•    Designated  staff  member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 \r\n\r\n\r\nService   Guidelines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•!•    Show  respect   & consideration\r\n\r\n•!•    Ask  before  helping\r\n\r\n•!•     Talk directly to the person\r\n\r\n•!•    Refer  to disability only if relevant\r\n\r\n•!•    Avoid  negative descriptions\r\n\r\n•!•    Refer  to the person   first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.   .•.-....;;\r\n~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGITISATION OF LIBRARY \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGITISATION  OF LIBRARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDigitisation  (Definition)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n''Digitisationrefers to the process  of translating  a piece   of information such   as   book,  sound    recording, picture    or  video into   bits.     Bits   are  the fundamental     units     of   information   in   a   computer    systems.       Turning information  into  these  binary  digits is called digitisation\"   Digitisation is one of the  hot   topics  in  librarianship  today.   To build  a  'digital library' requires that   the  content    of a  collection be  available electronically.  The  rhetoric  of the  information  highway has  provided  the  impetus  to convert   many   existing paper-based    (or   sound,     video) collection into   new    digital media.     The assumptions    that   digital collections will  be  more   accessible  to  a  broader range  of   users,    presumably    through   networking    techniques,    and   new efficiencies are  to be gained  in resource sharing and  for preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigitisation  Process\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDigitisation requires a  basic process,  which involves  different sets   of hardware   and    software  technologies  at   each    step.        Determining   the appropriate technology is  directly linked   to the  anticipated  use  and  purpose of  the  materiel  being   digitized.  For  digitizing the   text   and   other  material, following four  methods  can  be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n8 \r\n(a) Manual data  entry  Scanning\r\n\r\n(b) Optical Character recognition (OCR)\r\n\r\n(c) Excalibur Technologiesand pattern   recognition technologies\r\n\r\n(d)Document  Imaging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na) \t\tThe simplest  method   converting an image     of  a page   (or  the  real  page of  text)  into   digital text  is  to  enter  it  manually.     This  is  usually   a  time consuming  method    but  very  useful   from the  point   of  view  of information retrieval.\r\n\r\n\r\nb)  In   the   second    method,   scanners   are   used    to  take   digital pictures   of objects.     Scanners  can  be  simple   desk   top  machines   or  very  large and complex systems  that process  thousands  of documents.\r\n\r\n\r\nc)  Another  simple   digitization process  is  of OCR i.e.  scanning printed   pages to  build   a  digital   database   of  text.      This  process   uses    OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software, which takes   a picture    of  the  page  and then  turns   it into  digital text,  which can  be edited   or fully  indexed.    OCR software must   distinguish  between blank  and  white  areas  of text.\r\nd)  Excalibur  Technologies and   Pattern Recognition   Technologies are  the next  generation  of OCRs, represented  by Pixie,  a product  being  developed by   Excalibur  Technologies.    This   software   uses    a   technology called Adaptive  Pattern   Recognition, which attempts   to  mimic    aspects    of  the neural   patterns   of  the  brain.   The  software  can   be  taught    to  recognize verietions  and  relationships  in pattern,  such   as  patterns   of  text  rather than  readable  text.     The  retrieval of search   terms   uses   what    Excalibur calls ''fuzzy  matching\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 \r\ne)  Document   Imaging, a simple  method   if capturing  text,  involves taking  an electronic picture    of each  page  of text  with  the  same   type  of scanner  as one  would   use  for  OCR.  However, the  difference is  that   the  images   are stored    as graphic files  rather  than  text  files.   A similar   technology is  used for fax  transmission.    Each page  is stored  as one picture.   The  text  on  the\r\npage  cannot   be edited  or indexed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAdvantages\tDisadvantages\r\n\t•    Quick  Delivery Time\r\n\r\n• \tCosts can   be  favourable  compared to in-house  costs\r\n• \tRange    of     scanning     equipment available\r\n• \tBureau           absorbs         equipment depreciation and  obsolescence costs\t• \t\tCopyright of digital images  needs   to be\tassigned     to     client     in      the contract,  and   not   retained   by   the bureau\r\n• \tLack     of    control     over     scanning environment\r\n•    Need  to transport material\r\n\r\n•    Degree of  trust   involved  in  Quality\r\n\r\nAssurance\r\n\r\n• \tService level   agreements   needs    to be right\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreserving the  Digitized Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRapid    developments   are   taking   place    in   both    the   hardware  and software involved in  digitization.      This  means    that   the  present    technology will  soon   be  supplemented   by  newer   technology.   The  stability  of  current systems   and   the  digitized products  is  thus   questioned.

Most    of   the    digital  libraries  use    Internet   for   electronic publication   & Distribution.   It  promises   universal  and   unified   access   for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nElectronic environment  enables editors   to send   the  manuscripts of scholarly articles to reviewers &  to receive responses  more  quickly   and  to publish    the journal    expeditiously.  In electronic form  the  type  setting   cost  of a paper  is low compare to other  forms.  Publication of University Journal can be done  by mounting  it on  the  network  as  soon  it clears the  editorial review. The subscribers  else  where can retrieve them  from  network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight  Management:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  an  important  issue   which includes  ownership designation, billing   requirement    {or)   royally   management.

The  fee  may   be pay-per  use,  pay  per  a preset   number  of user  for  a specified period   of time. Collecting money   for  use  of a particular  piece   of item   such   as  diagram or image   within    a  large  item   may   be  more   expensive   than   to  simply   grant permission  to use  it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15 \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnological   used:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon  technical factors   affecting right   management   such   as  laws, legislation,  regulations  and  licenses are developed to data  improper access  & use  of information  & to product  intellectual property rights.\r\nTechnology has  developed some  methods  for right  management.\r\n\r\nIBM  has   developed  visible and   hidden    marking   techniques   that   enables designation   and   ownership   of  digital content    and   data   misuse     variable watermarks  utilising a patented   process  called  VariableRandom  Brightness Alteration (VRBA)\r\nLeast  significant Bit  Coding (BC) techniques  is  implemented   by hiding    data    by   adjusting   one   of   the   light    bits   representing   a   byte    of inform ation of an  image.

Thousands  of  CD-ROM databases  are  currently  available from  multitude   of CD-ROM producers   including  Silver   Platter,  which  alone   produces   more than  200  CD-ROMinformation  products.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore   ever  several   full-text  databases  also   started    appearing  in  late\r\n\r\n1980s   and  early  1990s  launching  the  beginning of a new  digital era.   Some of  the  important  full-text  digital collections available on  CD-ROM include: ADONIS, IEEE/    IEE  Electronic Library {!EL}, ABJ/JNFORM, UMl's Business express    and   Library and   General Periodicals,   Espace,   World, US  Patents, etc.     CD-ROM networking   technology is  now   available for  providing  web-\r\n\r\n\r\n17 \r\nbased    simultaneous    access    to   CD-ROM  databases   on   the   Local   Area Network   (LAN) as    well   as    Wide   Area   Network   (WAN).       More   evolved technology allows caching the  contents  ofCD-ROMs  on  to a server, which, in tern,  provides  web-based simultaneous    and  faster  access   to the  information contents   of   CD-ROM on   LAN/WAN.     The   libraries  have    an   option  to subscribe  to these  full-text  databases as a part  of their  digital resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes  of Digital  Resources \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes  of Digital  Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nTypes  of Digital  Resources\r\n\r\nDigital  resources  refers    to   any   resource,   which  is   in digitized form.

These   factors   make   it  inevitable  for  a present    day  research library  to acquire digital  resources.\r\nIn making   of acquisition   strategy, the principal considerations  include:-\r\n\r\nL,  It is advisable  that  conventional collection development  criteria should   be paramount\tand  should   be  applied   consistently  across   formats  including digital  resources,  which  include.\r\n\r\n\r\na)  establishing  a coherent rationale for the  acquisition  of each  resources. b)  meeting  faculty   and  student    information  needs,   and  providing orderly\r\naccess  preparing.\r\n\r\nc)  guidelines   to  the  digital  resources,  and  integrating  them   into  library service  programmes.\r\nd)  ensuring   that   the  advantages  of  the  digital  resources  are  significant enough   to justify   its  selection in  digital  format.\r\n2.   Priority     should    be given   to  digital  format   acquisition  of  those  resources\r\n\r\nwhich    offer   economics   of  scale   i.e.   benefit    to   the   most    faculty    and students  (locally and/or   system   wide.\r\n3.  Priority should    be  given   to  digital  resources  when   they   offer  significant\r\n\r\nadded    value    over   print    equivalent   in   such    ways    as   :   more    timely availability,  more   extensive  content,  greater   functionality   such    as   the ability  to invoke   linkages  to local and/or   related  resources,  greater  access because  they   can  be  delivered rapidly, remotely,  at  any   time,  improved resources   sharing   due    to   the   ubiquity   of   digital   resources,   ease   of archiving, replacing, preserving.\r\n4.   A digital  collection must   contain   a sufficient  critical  mass   to evaluate its utility  and  to justify   its  selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23 \r\nSelection  Criteria  for Acquisition  of Digital  Resources\r\n\r\nIn  the  digital library, Criteria should   be  formulated   to  determine  the contents  of the  digital collections.  For a specific criteria must   be established for  deciding  what   contents  are  collected and   which of  them   belong to  the core and  to the fringe area.\r\nSelection criteria for digital resources comprises following levels  of review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n;.\"'       Is the  content   eppropriete  to the library  mission?\r\n\r\n;.\"'\tAre   the  format   and  iniormetion  delivery medium   eppropriete  to  the content   and  with  the rationale for resources acquiring?\r\n;.\"'\tIs  the  acquisition practicable  within the  existing budgetary, technical, legal and  other  constraints?\r\n;.\"'\t\tIs  the  resources  compatible  with  the  library's overall strategic digital library  vision and  current  infrastructure?\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition: How  can  Digital Collection be Acquired?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   One   option  of   acquisition   of   digital  resources   is   digitizing  existing important  and  useful  print  material.  It also  helps   in preserving  rare  and fragile objects   without   denying access   to those  who  wish  to study   them.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Links   and pointers  to resources, which are freely  available on  the internet and   are   of  significant  scholarly  value,  can   be  added    to   the   library's catalogues, databases  and  networked resources.\r\n3.  Purchased  or licensed  material such   as  electronic journals  or databases.\r\n\r\nIn  many   cases   this  materials  is  not   \"physically owned\" by  the  library  in the  same   sense   that  printed   book  or journals  may  be  owned, but  instead \r\nthe library  has  acquired specific access  rights   to the  materiel  on behalf  of library's clientele.\r\n\r\nOnce   the  material  is  selected  for  acquiring,    following  checklist  should    be considered,  keeping  in  view benefits offered  to the librery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\n1       Library staff  in case  of online\r\nDatabase searching,  etc.\r\n2     User training e.g.  CD-Rom\r\nSearching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGITAL ACQUISITION \r\nDIGITAL ACQUISITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital  Resources  of Information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resources  of information  which  are eveileble in  the  form  ol Digital or Electronic format   are known   as  digital  resources.

The  basic  requirements   for  creating digital resources are:\r\n\r\n\r\n>-     All the functions  of the Library should   be computerized.\r\n,    Networking  tacilities  like   LAN  and    WAN  must    be  available in  the\r\n\r\nLibrary,\r\n>   CD-ROMand  Multimedia  Workstations  to be installed.\r\n>   Internet  connection must   be provided.\r\n\r\n,    Digital computer  Scanner and  CD-Writerfacilities to be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreation  of Digital  Resources  of Information:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComputerized  Catalogues may  be created  and  made   accessible  for  the  users by maintaining  separate  computer  systems   through  LAN  Efforts   have   to  be made    to  produce   all   documents   in   digital form.       This   will  reduce    our expenditure  in  converting texts  to digital form.    Creating texts  in  digital form would  facilitate in publishing  of documents  electronically either  on  the  Web or in  the  form  of CDs etc.   Information  using  the  Electronic texts  & Journals should    be  created    and   provided   through  LAN   or   WAN  or  Intra/Internet facilities to the  users.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeparate  Web page  may   be  created   by  the  Library highlighting  its  services and   collections   on   Internet   which  will  support   electronic  publishing   of reports   announcements,   new  additions  notices   etc.,  and  increase  the  use  of its resources .Daily news,  important Notices and  Circulars, list  of new  arrival\r\n\r\n30 \r\nof  Books     and   Journals,    Academic   Advertisements,      fellowships    etc   can   be created   and  provided   through  E-mail   and  Bulletin   Board   Service.\r\nCD-ROM  search     ma    be   admissible     to   the    uses     by    creating    and managing   separate   CD-ROM workstations   for  which   a good   collection  of  CD• ROMs  and   Multimedia    CDs   should     be  purchased    and   kept    at   the   libraries for  accessing   the  relevant  information   after  getting    signature   and   data   about the  CD-ROMs  searched   by  the   users.     For  that   a separate   register  should    be kept   to avoid   multiletion    or misplacement    of  CD-ROMs.\r\nUsing   the   Computer   Scanners    and   CD-.Writer,    relevant   and   required images    from   text   books   and  journals    and   other   primary   documents    may   be scanned   and   included   in  the  required   documents    and   they   may   be provided to  the  users   on  demand   with  reasonable   charges.\r\nInternet   access    may   be provided   to  the   user   for  retrieving   the  required\r\n\r\ninformation     and    fee   may     be   collected   for   browsing    the    Internet    and    a\r\n\r\nseparate   data   and   account\tmay   be maintained\tfor  the  same.\r\nElectronic Information\tResources:\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  libraries  with   their   traditional  holdings  in  print   format,   are now   being   added   with   electronic information  resources  in  various   formats like  CD-ROM and  DVD-ROM databases,  On-line databases,  E-Journals  and plenty    of  Internet  or  Web  resources.    The  content    of  these   sources  varies from  bibliographic or factual   to full  text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31 \r\n1.  CD-ROM Databases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCD-ROM databases  are  increasing  day  by  day  in  almost   all  fields due  to their  many   advantages in information storage and  retrieval.  Majority of publishers   of  books   and  journals,   on-line  vendors  and   various learned societies are   bringing   out   new   titles   in   CD  format    with   powerful,  user• friendly retrieval software.   Electronic information  resources  in  CD format include     abstracting    and    indexing   services,   encyclopedias,   dictionaries,. directories, yearbooks,  back   volumes, patents,   standards   and  many   other reference works.  The  CD-ROMtechnology has  given  ample   opportunities  for information  professionals   to  introduce  more   information  services  to  end• users.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. DVD-ROM Databases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  advent   of DVD- Digital Video Disc  or Digital Versatile Disc, with  its  17\r\n\r\nGB  of  high   data   storage capacity, has   made   it  possible   to  include    more multimedia   elements  like  video and  sound   and   to integrate  many   reference sources  on  a  single disc.     \"The  other  features  like  higher   quality   of  sound and  video, higher   rate  of data  transfer, data  security  etc.,  are  making   DVD more   viable option than   CD-ROM. But,   at present    due   to  some   problems like  lack  of standards  among   the  manufacturers   of   DVDs and  drives, need for extra hardware on PCs and  their  higher  prices   are making    the  growth   of DVD technology  slow\".   Some   DVD reference  sources  include    Britannics DVD   99,      Websters     International    DVD   Encyclopedia-2000,      Grolier Multimedia   Encyclopedia,   Eyewitness    World  Altas     DVD-ROM  Deluxe Edition,   The  Complete National Geographicon DVD-ROMetc .\r\n\r\n.32 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Online   Databases\r\n\r\nThe  recent   growth   of Internet  and   the  popularity  and   ease  in  use  of Web  are  making    Iibreries   to subscribe  to  online   information services.   The online   database  services  like   Dialog (KR  Information)   and   STN   are  now moving   towards being   webcentric.   The  usage of  online   databases  against their  CD-ROMcounterparts  has  to be evaluated and  decided on  the  basis  of cost   effectiveness   and   timeless.   Few  Online information  services  are  KR ScienceBase   and   STN.     The  KR  ScienceBase  which  includes  information sources  like  BIOSIS, CA Search, Elsevier Science Publishers, Reuters, NTIS etc.      The   STN   international   provides   a   complete   collection  of  in-depth databases  in  science   and   technology which gives   quick,   direct  links   to  the literature,  patents     and   chemical  catalogues,  chemical,  Abstract  Service, producer   of   the    world's largest    and    most     comprehensive    database   of chemical information,  offers several databases  on  STN  like  CAplus, INSPEC, MEDLINE,SC/SEARCH, TOXLITETC\r\n\r\n\r\n4. E-Journals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE-Journals   or Electronic Journals  are  gaining  more   importance  with the    emergence   of   Internet.       The   Publishing   world  is    undergoing  a revolutionary  change   as  more   and   more   publications   are  becoming  WEB centric.   «Most of the publishers  are  choosing  WEB as  a an  access   medium using  HTML to mark   up  the journal    content   so  that  it  can  be  read  using   a web  browser.   These are  also  as  networked  E-Journals.     Other  publishers have  chosen   to use  additional access  software in  conjunction  with  the  WEB.\r\n\r\n\r\n33 \r\nthe most  popular  being Adobe  Acrobat and  its  associated  Portable Document\r\n\r\nFormat  (PDF)file type\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternet  as an  Electronic Information  Resource\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe INTERNET and  its  World Wide Web (WWU1 have  given a paradigm shift    to  information   management.      The   information   available  on   net   is increasing rapidly   and  the  task  of providing relevant information  to patrons is gaining  paramount   importance  in     all  types   of  libraries.   Most   of  the reputed   publishers,    learned  and   commercial   societies   are   hosting     their products  on net  and  also  all libraries are sharing  their  internal  and  external information   resources   by   means    of   web   pages    and    Web-OPACs.   The powerful  search   engines  over  net  are  aiding   the  information  location quite efficiently.  The   Internet  services like  E-mail, Bulletin Boards, Newsgroups, Discussion  Lists,   etc  are  gaining importance  in  Iibreries  and  are  becoming indispensable  resources  for  the  users.  Due  to impact   of Internet,  there  is  a swift  migration  from   offline to  online, as   Web  is  becoming  a popular  user interface for providing access   to remote   and  frequently  updated resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital  libraries for  Virtual  communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n• \t\tCopyright:  Libraries  (individually and   collectively) are   creating   digital collections on  the  Internet,  often  in  collaboration with  teaching  staff and in \tsupport    of   academic   programs    that    reach     across    institutions. Copyright  is  retained  for  the  added   value   that   has   been  created, and educational\tuse  is  permitted,   subsidised   by  library   budgets   or paid   by subscription\r\n\r\n\r\n34 \r\n• \t\tGift  exchange:  The   World Wide  Web  allows authors  to place   their  own  intellectual\tproperty   directly  into   a.    new,   global public    domain.     The public  portion   of the  Web is  the  equivalent in  size  of a.  library  of a.  million volumes,  ranging in  content   from  government   information   to  electronic journals\t  to   teaching  and   learning  resources    created    by   faculty    and students\ta.round the  world.\r\n• \tContract: Publishers  a.re creating an  e-commerce  library, online fee-for• service information  on  the private  pa.rt of the  Net,  that  which is protected by  password  and   encryption technologies.   In  the  next   few  years,   it  is estimated\tthat    5000    peer-reviewed   print    journals    in    the    sciences, technology, medicine and  industry  will be avila.bleonline Anywhere in  the world, for a.  fee.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovering the  relative value of each  of these  information  resources  for  the design of digital libraries is one  of our interesting   challenges.  However, it is important  to remember  that  if the  digital library  is still  a.  metaphor,  so  too is the idea.of the Internet  economy, and  new  options   may  yet  emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline information,   while necessary,  is  not   a  sufficient  vision of  a  digital library.   Libraries are  more   than   information  inventories   and   information management   tools   such   as  online catalogues: they   ere  social institutions that    support    a   sense     a   academic   community    within   disciplines   and professions.\r\nInformation  Property and  digital  libraries\r\n\r\nToday three   kinds    of  digital libraries ere   evolving,  reflecting  three kinds   of intellectual  property  management:  the  subsidised  research library, based  on  copyright policy,• the public   domain   information  of the  Web,  based\r\n\r\n\r\n35 \r\non   a  gift   exchange  economy;  and    the   market     economy   of   commercial publishing,  based  on contract law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe digital  library  as a community\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA  library   is   more    than    books    and   bricks.    If  it   is   successful,   is supports   a  sense    of  community   among    its   users,   as   an   archive of  its collective knowledge  and  as  a resource  for  its  future.      Yet  digital libraries thus   far  have   tended   to  be  digitised versions of  card  catalogs, books   and journals,   and   as  such   do  not   evoke a  sense    of  community.     But   digital libraries might   well be designed to do so.\r\nFirst   of  all,  it  seems    that   digital places    can   evoke   emotional  and intellectual engagement.   In Life on  the  screen   sherry   Turkle    has  described the    way   that    software   and   network   communications    are   transforming psychology.  As  a sociologist and  psychoanalyst   she  concludes  that   'virtual life'  is  emotionally  and   intellectually  part   of  'read lite;  but   simulations   of virtual   life   with   their   anonymous   role-playing are   capable of  supporting emotional experimentation  and growth.\r\nCommunity  networks\r\n\r\nCommunity   networks   are   based    upon   geographical proximity,   but participation  in  a  sense   of place   and   community   is  extended   by  network communication,   such  as electronicmain,  Internet relay  chat, bulletin boards and    Web pages.      • Examples   of  community   networks   include    municipal governments   using   the  network    to involve citizens   in  political deliberation, or  corporations   using   electronic mail   and   teleconferencing.    Clearly and\r\n\r\n36 \r\ntraditional  sense     of   community    is   dependent    upon    frequent   personal interaction, but   community  networks  reinforce a  sense   of membership   by making   information  or communication  more  accessible.  Many  libraries use Webpages, email  and  lists  in precisely  this  way  to extend   a sense   of access into   their   communities;   thus   digital libraries should    be  designed  as     an extension  of a physical library, not  their  replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Extensions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual extensions  sustain   in  a sense   of community  among   a group   of people    separated   by   geographical  distance   but    who   have    intermittent personal  contact.    Virtual extensions  typically create a  sense   of place   by collaborative work on  a  shared   problem, requiring occasional face-to-face meetings,  but  sustained  by a sense   of shared   culture   and  profession.   Many classrooms   use   Web  pages   and   electronic mail   as   virtual   extensions,  to encourage discussion  outside   classroom hours.     Professions and  academic disciplines   use    Web  pages,  email and   lists   in   this   manner,   to  reinforce professional  values   and  trade information on  skilled  practice; librarians are exemplars  of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Communities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual communities  in  this  strict  sense,   then,   are groups   of strangers separated    by   geographical  distance,   but    sharing   a   common   interest, expressed  by  participation  in  computer-mediated communication.    Virtual communities   in   this   specific sense   may   have   relatively  little   stability over time, and  relatively more  listeners  than  speakers.   And  yet   they  are  of great interest    because  they  may   be  robust   even  if  the  members  have   never   met\r\n\r\n37 \r\nand  are  separated  by  great   distances.   They  are,  in  essence,  a  sustained conversation   on   a   (usually) narrow    topic  of  mutual     interest     or  shared problems    rather     than    physical   proximity.       Thus    many     of   the    most successful  sites  provide scarce information and  advice about   very specialised topics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION\t\tOF DIGITAL RESOURCES \r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION   OF DIGITAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital preservation  is  a process  by  which data  is preserved in digital form   in   order  to  ensure    usability,   durability  and   intellectual integrity    of  the  information  contained  therein.    A more  precise   definition as given   by Kelly  (1999), 'The  storage, maintenance,  and  accessibility   of digital object   (include any  digital material  such   as  a  text  document,  an image file,  a multimedia  CD-ROMor a database) over  Jong  term,   usually as  a consequence  of applying one  or more  digital preservation strategies. The   term   digital preservation  is   used   in  different  ways. Fresco (1999) defines    the   terms   as,   \"the  storage, maintenance   and   access    to  digital objects over Jong term\".  The key  point   of this  definition is  that  it is about ensuring   that   intellectual   content,   which  is   already  in   digital form, remains  accessible  to the future  generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Preservation of Digital Resources\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DigitalPreservation\" means   taking  steps   to ensure   the Jong term access   to the  digital documents.   Unlike the print  publications,  the  digital preservation  is more  complex as  one  has  to take  care  of many   aspects   of the  documents   such   as  content, presentation,  functionality,  authenticity etc.    At   the   time   of  selection and   acquisition   only   one  must    think    of preservation    of digital resources.  The digital technology as  well as other technologies such    as  Internet  and   Web  technologies are   continuously changing  due   to  upgradations  of software and  hardware, proliferation of standards  and  protocols for file formats, network interfaces, storage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39 \r\nmedia and  devices etc.    As  a result   of which there  is  constant  danger of\r\n\r\n\"tcchrio-obsolcscence\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Issues   Relating to Digital Preservation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  fundamental  problem  of preserving electronic documents  or \"digital objects\" stems   from  the  nature   of the  objects   themselves.    Digital objects  are   accessible   only    through   combinations   of   hardware   and software.   The  hardware and  software become  obsolete in  cycles of less than   three  years.     Ensuring  ongoing access,  therefore, requires currency with   technology  changes,  and   moving    digital objects   from   obsolete  to current   file formats, storage media, operating systems  and  so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  1. Technological Obsolescence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInnovation    ui        computer    hardware,    storage   and     software industries  continues  at a rapid  pace,   usually  yielding greater  storage and processing  capacities at lower  cost.   Devices, processes  and  software for \r\nrecording and  storing   information  are  being  replaced  with  new  products and   methods   at  regular   three   to  five  years    cycles, driven   primarily  by market   forces.   Records created  in  digital form  in  the  first  instance  and those  converted retrospectively from  paper  or microfilm to digital form  are equally   vulnerable to technological obsolescence.  It  is  costly  and  difficult for \tvendors   to   assure     that    their    products    are    either    backwardly compatible\twith   previous   version  or  that   they   can   inter-operate  with competing products\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Migration of Digital Information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMigration is  the  periodic  transfer  of  digital materials  from   one hardware  or software configuration to another  or from  one generation of computer   technology   to   a   subsequent    generation.       The   purpose   of migration is  to preserve  the  integrity  of digital objects   and  to   retain the ability  for  clients   to retrieve, display, and  otherwise  use  them   in  face  of constantly  changing  technology.   It has  always been  a problem  with  the preservationists   to make   an  exact  copy  or replica of a databases  or other digital  objects    as   hardware  and    software   change    makes     the   object incompatible  with  the new  generation of technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.Legal and  Organizational Issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~1 \r\nThe  barriers to  decisive preservation  action   is  caused   by  wide spread    uncertainty    about    legal   and    organizational  requirements   for managing  the  intellectual property  that  digital information presents.   Any preservation   strategy   will  require  the   permission   from    the   copyright holders.   Permission  could  be needed   to digitize a  work  of art;  store  the digitized image   in  an  archive; move   the  digital image   between archives; grant    permission    for   authorization   to   the   digital image;  change    file formats;  change   storage media; and  also  for  the  possible  deletion of  the digital image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Infrastructure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  digital preservation, the  organizational effort-the process  of building  infrastructure-necessarily   involves  multiple,  interrelated  factors such    as,   institutions,    services,  technologies,  and   qualified  personnel capable of supporting  a distributed  system   of digital archive.  The effort to meet    cultural   imperative   of   digital  preservation   required   a   complex iteration and  reiteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Conceptual Frame Work or Standards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother   challenge  is   the   absence   of   established   standards, protocols, and  proven   methods  for preserving digital information.   There is Jack  of adequate  research in  the  areas such   as  framing key  problems\r\n\r\n\r\n~2 \r\nassociated  with  digital information,  defining critical issues,    establishing standards  for  digital preservation, etc.    Hedstrom  & Montgomery  (1998), in   their   survey    'Digital Preservation Needs   and   Requirements   in  RLG (Research Library Groups) Member Institutions'  found    that   majority  of member   institutions    have   not   developed  policies  for   the   acquisition, storage,  freshing   and   migration  of   digital  information   and   have   not developed methods  to preserve digital information\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Hence preservation policy  for digital resources  is of prime  importance  and should   take  care  of following aspects\r\n1.   Preservation of  digital resources  as  different  levels  depending  on  its\r\n\r\nusability functionalities\r\n\r\n2.  Continuous   reviewing  of  the   digital  resources   ensuring   Jong  term access   to them\r\n3.   Weeding out  obsolete information and  invalid   websites\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Preservation of digital resources can  be possible  by three  ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Technology preservation:    The  older technology can  be preserved  for viewing digital objects   in  their  original   formats  but   it  is  not   feasible in Jong  term   due   to  cost,   space   and   technical  support  requirements.   e.g. Hardware\r\n2.  Technology emulation:     It refers to creating new  software that  copies the    operations   of   older  hardware  and    software   thus    ensuring   it's originality in  terms  of physical presence,  content   and  functionality.   Some digital  resources   are   highly    dependent    on   particular   hardware   or software.   Emulation  techniques  can  be  useful   in  such   cases.  However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43 \r\nemulation  for preserving  digital resources  over  the Jong term  has  not  been tested.\r\n3.  Data  migration:   Migration covers a range   of activities  to periodically\r\n\r\ncopy,   convert    or   transfer  digital  information   from   a  medium   that   is becoming obsolete or physically deteriorating to a newer  one  ( e.g. Floppy disk   to  CD-ROM}, and/or    converting  from   one  format    to  another  (e.g. Microsoft Word to ASCII},and/or  moving   documents  from  one platform to another  {e.g.  VAX to  UNIX). Migration certainly preserves  the physically presence  and  the  content   of the digital object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Strategies  for Digital  Preservation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital preservation  is  defined   as  the  storage, maintenance,  and access   to  digital object over  the  Jong  term,   usually   as  a  consequence  of applying   one    or   more     digital  preservation    strategies.       A    digital preservation  strategy should   be evaluated against   a set  of criteria such  as technological feasibility,  cost-effectiveness,  effectiveness  in  retaining  the essential    attributes    of   digital  information,   acceptance   by   creators, managers  of  digital repositories, and   user   communities.     Hendly   (1998) identified   three   potential   strategies  for   ensuring   long   term   access    to digital  information.      These  include     (1)   Technology preservation,   (2) Technology emulation  and   (3) Digital information  migration.   However, Russel    (1999) and  Bullock  (1999) have   accepted  \"output   to permanent paper  of microfilm\" as a low-tech strategy for preservation\r\n\r\n\r\n8.  Technology Preservation \r\nAnother method   for ensuring ongoing access   to digital objects would be to simply   keep   older  technology available for  use.    The most   obvious way  of ensuring  that   the  object is preserved  as  it  was  created  is  to preserve  the environment\tused    to  create and   use   resources,   that   is  preserve   the software and  hardware environment  that  was  used   to access   the resource when   it   was   created.   For  some   digital objects    this   may   be   the   best solution-at  least  in  the  short-run  because it  ensures  that  the  material is accessible  by preserving  the access  tools  as  well as  the  object itself\r\n\r\n\r\nDigital Preservation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding  on  the  work  of  the  Commission  on  Preservation and  Access (CPA)CLJRand  the  DLF remain   committed  to maintaining  long-term  access to  the   digital intellectual  and   scholarly  record.    They   have   a  particular interest   in practical initiatives  and  in  research into  most   poorly   understood areas.

It's  a high   time  for  traditional libraries that    their    change    their   approach   as    the   evailebility   of   the    digital resources is growing day  by day.   In India, already many   library  networks such    as  JNFLIBNET, Developing Library Network  (Formerly known    as DELNET), PUNENET, MALIBNET ETC.   are   established   and   marching towards  their  respective goals.   Through these   networks   only  Consortia purchase   and   Preservation programmes   for   digital   resources   can   be successfully  implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany   libraries  are  still  experimenting   with   the  existing  and   various other   options   for  access   to material provided  by  electronic means.      The future    of  research  and   scholarship  depends   on  the   ability   to preserve digital  resources  into  the  future.     The preservation  and  Jong term  access to  digital   materials   will  be  an   era  of  concern  for  libraries  and   other libraries  and   other   organizations  involved  in   the   preservation   of  our scholarly  and  cultural  heritage  well into   the  new  millennium.    Although the   technical  challenges  are  great, there   are  Jot  of  other   non-technical issues   that  will need   to be addressed  like:  building  up  a legal framework and   bringing  out   consensus   on   widely   accepted  standards  relating  to digital  preservation.    Libraries should   have   strategic  plans   and  policies towards   building    the    technological   infrastructure     and    procedures, establishing    mechanisms     of   recording   meta     data,     moving     digital resources  from   Jess  stable   carriers to  more   stable   ones   and  identifying formats for easier  migration of digital  information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49 \r\nIn   the   future    ,    the   Librsrien's  duties    will  see   a  shift   from   a  primary emphasis   on  acquisition  ,  preservation  and   storage to  an  emphasis  on teaching  ,   consulting  ,researching  ,   preserving  intellectual   and   access freedom and  collaborating in  the  design,    application and  maintenance  of information  access  systems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJu \r\nReferences:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO  CALIBER 2001,   Creation and  Management  of Digital resources.\r\n\r\nM.KR.
