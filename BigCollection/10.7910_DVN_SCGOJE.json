These parameters include time period, determined to be September 2008 through 2014, the nature of the adversaries, limited to radiological and nuclear end users and not intermediaries, a geographical scope, limited to U.S. homeland and overseas territories, the types of materials, designated as either nuclear or radiological, defensive trajectory assumptions, which maintained physical, systemic, or policy related defensive measures, and geopolitical structure assumptions, which included relevant international developments with the exclusion of major worldwide upheavals. The RANNSAD study, underpinned by a threat equation that emphasized non-state actor motivation, capability, and opportunity, differentiated clearly between radiological and nuclear weapons, except regarding some motivational aspects and by necessity in certain statistical calculations. Data for the analyses were drawn from multiple unclassified (primary and secondary) sources, including perpetrator statements, trial transcripts, news reports, journal articles and scholarly books, as well as existing terrorism databases. The initial source used to establish the list of radiological and nuclear non-state actors was the Monterey Institute of International Studies' Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism Database (WMDTDB). This initial research yielded 131 incidents and 80 potential perpetrators and upon further research and consolidation, a list of 45 distinct radiological and nuclear perpetrators was produced to profile in the RANNSAD."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record abstracts"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"RANNSAD_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43281,"dataFile":{"id":2300826,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"RANNSAD_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":292915,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69627","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a524dd4b680b2729d857809d9ad7e4ed","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a524dd4b680b2729d857809d9ad7e4ed"}}},{"description":"","label":"RANNSAD_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43281,"dataFile":{"id":2300825,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"RANNSAD_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":303350,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69626","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:1S4k29WvGinRZA8JYm9zfg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"45578121342292c62394a7d772cb6c9e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"45578121342292c62394a7d772cb6c9e"}}}]}}}
