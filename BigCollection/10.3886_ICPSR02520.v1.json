The data represent a secondary  analysis of five ICPSR collections: (1) CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH AND  LOW CRIME NEIGHBORHOODS IN ATLANTA, 1980 (ICPSR 7951), (2) CRIME  CHANGES IN BALTIMORE, 1970-1994 (ICPSR 2352), (3) CITIZEN  PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY CRIME PREVENTION, 1979: CHICAGO  METROPOLITAN AREA SURVEY (ICPSR 8086), (4) CRIME, FEAR, AND CONTROL IN  NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CENTERS: MINNEAPOLIS AND ST.
