Those surveyed were also asked if people who joined the military should be asked if they were gay, whether they approved of President Bill Clinton's handling of the issue of gays in the military, and whether Clinton had spent too much time on the issue. Additional questions concerned Clinton's appointment of his wife Hillary as head of a task force on health care reform, and her role in the Clinton Administration.
