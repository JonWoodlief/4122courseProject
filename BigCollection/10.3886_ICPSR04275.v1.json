The 2002 sophomore cohort will be  followed, initially at 2-year intervals, to collect policy-relevant  data about educational processes and outcomes, especially as such data  pertain to student learning, predictors of dropping out, and high  school effects on students' access to, and success in, postsecondary  education and the work force. Part 1, Student-Level Data, is  comprised of data from assessments of students (achievement tests in  mathematics and reading), surveys of students, surveys of parents, and  surveys of teachers. The student assessments measured achievement in  mathematics and reading, and they provided baseline scores that can  serve as a covariate or control variable for later analyses. The  student questionnaire gathered information about the student's  background, school experiences and activities, plans and goals for the  future, employment and out-of-school experiences, language background,  and psychological orientation toward learning. One parent of each  participating sophomore was asked to respond to a parent survey. The  parent questionnaire was designed to gauge parental aspirations for  the child, home background and the home education support system, the  child's educational history prior to 10th grade, and parental  interactions with and opinions about the student's school. For each  student enrolled in English or mathematics, a teacher was also  selected to participate in a teacher survey. The teacher questionnaire  collected the teacher's evaluations of the student and provided  information about the teacher's background and activities. Part 2,  School-Level Data, is comprised of data from surveys of school  administrators, surveys of librarians, and a facilities checklist  (completed by survey administrators, based on their observations at  the school). The school administrator questionnaire collected  information on the school in six areas: school characteristics,  student characteristics, teaching staff characteristics,\nschool  policies and programs, technology, and school governance and  climate. The head librarian or media center director at each school  was asked to complete a library media center questionnaire that  inquired into the school's library media center facility, its  staffing, its technological resources, collection and expenditures,  and scheduling and transactions. The facilities checklist was a brief  observational form completed for each school. It collected information about the condition of school buildings and facilities."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic

Of the eligible schools, 752 participated in the study. In  the second stage of sample selection, a sample of approximately 26  sophomores, from within each of the participating public and private  schools was selected. Each school was asked to provide a list of 10th  grade students, and quality assurance (QA) checks were performed on  each list that was received. A stratified systematic sample of  students was selected on a flow basis as student lists were received.  The strata were Hispanic, Asian, Black, and Other race/ethnicity.  The total expected student sample size of approximately 20,000  (approximately 800 x 25) was expanded to select additional Hispanic  (if necessary) and Asian students in order to estimate subpopulation parameters within precision requirements."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self-enumerated questionnaire"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The general purpose of the weighting scheme was to  compensate for unequal probabilities of selection of schools and  students into the base year sample and to adjust for the fact that not  all schools and students selected into the sample actually  participated. Three sets of weights were computed: a school weight, a  weight for student questionnaire completion, and a contextual data  weight for the expanded sample of questionnaire eligible and  questionnaire ineligible students. Schools and students were adjusted  for nonresponse, and these adjustments were designed to significantly  reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for data elements known for most  respondents and nonrespondents. In addition, school weights were  poststratified to known population totals. Weighting is discussed in  detail in section 3.4 of the User Guide provided by the principle investigators."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"School-Level Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38824,"dataFile":{"id":2640468,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"School-Level Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Student-Level Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38824,"dataFile":{"id":2640467,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Student-Level Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
