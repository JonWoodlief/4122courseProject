Questions pertaining to the presidential   candidates focused on their ability to care about the needs and   problems of people and bring about the kind of change the country   needs, the likelihood that they would raise taxes, whether they could   be trusted to deal with all the problems a president faces, allegations   brought against Clinton concerning his draft status, allegations   regarding the Bush Administration's dealings with Iraq before the   Persian Gulf War, and Perot's reason for dropping out of the   presidential race in July. Additional questions probed for respondents'   opinions concerning the national economy, the financial situation of   the future\ngeneration of Americans, and the 1992 presidential campaign   as compared with the 1988 campaign. Those surveyed were also asked to   give their approval rating of George Bush with respect to his handling   of the presidency, foreign affairs, and the economy.
