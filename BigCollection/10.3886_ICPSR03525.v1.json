The School District Data Tape  (SDDT) created by the National Center for Education Statistics is a  recompilation of the 1970 Census Fourth Count Population data,  providing data tables for each school district in the country with 300  or more students. The preparation of the School District Data Tape  required three major steps: (1) overlaying school district boundaries  on census maps, (2) creating a geo-reference tape indicating the  percent of each census area falling within each school district, and  (3) merging the geo-reference tape with the 1970 Census Fourth Count  Population Files A (Traced Areas) and B (Minor Civil Divisions). Some  of the major uses of the School District Data Tape include: allocation  of federal funds, desegregation planning, bilingual and minority  special education planning, preschool and child care planning,  facility planning, redistricting, urban-suburban-rural analyses,  mobility analysis, social and economic inequality among school  districts, and school children profiles. In addition to these uses,  most state education agencies will find data by school district of  value in allocating federal and state aid to school districts and in  the evaluation of the inequality of property taxes as a basis for  financing elementary and secondary education. The School District Data  Tape matches, as closely as possible, the format of the Fourth Count (Population) Summary tapes supplied by the Census Bureau."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational background"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household composition"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school districts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR I.A.1.b.
