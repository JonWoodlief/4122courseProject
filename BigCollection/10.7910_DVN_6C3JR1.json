(2017). Issues and Advances in Anomaly Detection Evaluation for Joint Human-Automated Systems. To be presented at Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics 2017.\r\n\r\n<p>Each .RData file is an external representation of an R dataframe that can be read into an R environment with the 'load' function. The variables loaded are named ‘fault_free_training’, ‘fault_free_testing’, ‘faulty_testing’, and ‘faulty_training’, corresponding to the RData files.\r\n\r\n<p>Each dataframe contains 55 columns:\r\n\r\n<p>Column 1 ('faultNumber') ranges from 1 to 20 in the “Faulty” datasets and represents the fault type in the TEP. The “FaultFree” datasets only contain fault 0 (i.e. normal operating conditions).\r\n\r\n<p>Column 2 ('simulationRun') ranges from 1 to 500 and represents a different random number generator state from which a full TEP dataset was generated (Note: the actual seeds used to generate training and testing datasets were non-overlapping).\r\n\r\n<p>Column 3 ('sample') ranges either from 1 to 500 (“Training” datasets) or 1 to 960 (“Testing” datasets). The TEP variables (columns 4 to 55) were sampled every 3 minutes for a total duration of 25 hours and 48 hours respectively. Note that the faults were introduced 1 and 8 hours into the Faulty Training and Faulty Testing datasets, respectively.\r\n\r\n<p>Columns 4 to 55 contain the process variables; the column names retain the original variable names.\r\n\r\n<p>Acknowledgments.
