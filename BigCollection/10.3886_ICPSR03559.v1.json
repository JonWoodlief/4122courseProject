Those polled were residents of Prince  George's County and were asked about their political party  affiliation, whether they were going to vote in the Democratic primary  election, which candidate for county executive they intended to vote  for, how they rated the candidates for county executive, and how  interested they were in general in the county executive campaign.  Respondents were also asked which candidate they supported in the  general election for governor of Maryland. Additional questions asked  respondents to rate the quality of the job performance of the current  county executive Wayne Curry and the current county schools chief Iris  Metts. Respondents were asked about how Prince George's County rated  as a place to live, the quality of life in the county, what they liked  most about the county, and what they liked least about the  county. They were also asked to indicate whether several aspects of  the county were problems, including the quality of public schools,  unemployment rate, violent crime, drugs, relations between the police  and community, the overall health of the local economy, low-income  residents moving from the District into Prince George's County, the  absence of stores specializing in exclusive, high-end merchandise,  relations between the races, transportation and roads, and problems  related to immigrants. There were also questions regarding the  quality of public schools, whether the public schools were improving,  and whether the recent dismissal of the county's elected school board  was a good idea. Respondents were asked how well whites and Blacks  got along in the county, how important it was to have an  African-American county executive, whether whites or Blacks had too  much influence in county politics, whether it would be better if the  percentage of Blacks increased, and whether it would be better if the  percentage of whites increased. Opinions were also elicited on the new  TRIM law regarding property taxes, how safe from crime they felt, how  much force county police tended to use, and whether they favored  slot-machine gambling at horse racing tracks in Maryland. Background  information on respondents includes education, marital status, race,  income, gender, how long the respondent had lived in the county, whether they lived inside the Beltway, and whether they had children."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political affiliation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"schools"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
