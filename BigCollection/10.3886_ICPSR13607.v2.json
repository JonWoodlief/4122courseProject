One of  the measures that composed the Longitudinal Cohort Study was the Youth  Self Report (YSR). The YSR protocol, a self-administered survey, was  first developed by Thomas M. Achenbach and was derived from another  widely-used standardized measure in child psychology, the Child  Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The YSR was designed to assess the  emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents (aged 11 to 18) in a  standardized format. The PHDCN version of the YSR was administered to  subjects belonging to Cohorts 12 and 15 of the Longitudinal Cohort  Study.

It was designed to advance the understanding of the  developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social  behaviors. In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways  of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and  violence. At the same time, the project provided a detailed look at  the environments in which these social behaviors took place by  collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including  its people, institutions, and resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal  Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>One component of the PHDCN was the  Longitudinal Cohort Study, which was a series of coordinated  longitudinal studies that followed over 6,000 randomly selected  children, adolescents, and young adults, and their primary caregivers  over time to examine the changing circumstances of their lives, as  well as the personal characteristics, that might lead them toward or  away from a variety of antisocial behaviors. The age cohorts include  birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years.

The YSR has been identified as an  extremely reliable and valid measure for assessing adolescents'  emotional and behavioral problems. The purpose of the PHDCN YSR was to  obtain from the subject a self-perceived assessment on anxiety,  depression, obsessive-compulsion, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and  other antisocial behaviors, including measures of aggression, defiance  and involvement in delinquent behavior. The overall goal of the YSR  was to classify respondents' answers as either internalizing or  externalizing behaviors. Internalizing behaviors were defined as  co-occurring problems that mainly involved inner distress, such as  undue anxiety, depression, and inhibition, whereas e\nxternalizing  behaviors were defined as co-occurring problems that mainly involved  aggressive behaviors as well as conflicts with others and with social mores.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p><strong>Project on Human Development in Chicago  Neighborhoods</strong></p>\n\n<p>The city of Chicago was selected as the  research site for the PHDCN because of its extensive racial, ethnic,  and social-class diversity. The project collapsed 847 census tracts in  the city of Chicago into 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon  seven groupings of racial/ethnic composition and three levels of  socioeconomic status. The NCs were designed to be ecologically  meaningful. They were composed of geographically contiguous census  tracts, and geographic boundaries and knowledge of Chicago's  neighborhoods were considered in the definition of the NCs. Each NC  was comprised of approximately 8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal  Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a  stratified probability sample of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80  NCs were sampled from the 21 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by  three socioeconomic levels) with the goal of representing the 21 cells  as equally as possible to eliminate the confounding between  racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic status. Once the 80 NCs were  chosen, then block groups were selected at random within each of the  sample neighborhoods. A complete listing of dwelling units was  collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant women, children, and  young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18  years) were identified through in-person screening of approximately  40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The screening response rate  was 80 percent. Children within six months of the birthday that  qualified them for the sample were selected for inclusion in the  Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347 participants were  identified through the screening. Of the eligible study participants,  6,228 were interviewed.</p>\n\n<p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18,  primary caregivers as well as the child were interviewed. The primary  caregiver was the person found to spend the most time taking care of  the child. Separate research assistants administered the primary  caregiver interviews and the child interviews. The primary method of  data collection was face-to-face interviewing, although participants  who refused to complete the personal interview were administered a  phone interview. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, English, and  Polish. In Wave 1 the complete protocol was translated into Spanish  and Polish. An interpreter was hired for participants who spoke a  language other than English, Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age  and wave of data collection, participants were paid between $5 and $20  per interview. Other incentives, such as free passes to museums, the  aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes were also included.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions, assessing  impulse control and sensation-seeking traits, cognitive and language  development, leisure activities, delinquency and substance abuse,  friends' activities, as well as self-perception, attitudes, and  values. Caregivers were also interviewed about family structure,  parent characteristics, parent-child relationships, parent discipline  styles, family mental health, and family history of criminal behavior  and drug use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Youth Self Report (YSR)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Administered between 1994 and 1997, the Youth Self Report (YSR) was  completed by the subjects belonging to Cohorts 12 and 15 of the PHDCN  Longitudinal Cohort Study. The PHDCN version of the YSR consisted of  112 questions. Respondents were asked to rate a list of items that  applied to their behavior, occurring within the past six months, on a  three-point Likert-type response scale: 0 = not true, 1 = somewhat  true or sometimes true, and 2 = very true or often true. Questionnaire\nitems included \"I argue a lot,\" \"I brag,\" \"I feel lonely,\" \"I destroy  things belonging to others,\" \"I feel no one loves me,\" \"I am shy,\" \"I  threaten to hurt people,\" \"I like to make others laugh,\" \"I like to  help others,\" and \"I worry alot.\" The YSR was comprised of eight  sub-scales: Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxiety and Depression,  Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Aggressive  Behavior, and Delinquent Behaviors. Internalizing behaviors such as  anxiety, depression and other emotional problems not overtly evident  were measured by combining responses comprising the Withdrawn, Somatic  Complaints, and Anxious/Depressed sub-scales. Externalizing behaviors  such as aggression, hyperactivity, and other overt behavioral problems  were measured by combining responses comprising the Aggressive Behavior and Delinquent Behaviors sub-scales.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In addition to the variables containing the  responses to the YSR, there are several scale variables present in the  files, which including Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxiety and  Depression, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems,  Delinquent, Aggressive, Internalizing, and Externalizing  Behavior.
