The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) designed the survey in 2000 and 2001 to survey offender youth between the ages of 10 and 20.  SYRP asks the youth about their backgrounds, offense histories and problems; the facility environment; experiences in the facility; experiences with alcohol and drugs; experiences of victimization in placement; medical needs and services received; and their expectations for the future. SYRP research provides answers to a number of questions about the characteristics and experiences of youth in custody including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who are the youth in placement?</li>\n<li>What are their offenses?</li>\n<li>What are their family backgrounds?</li>\n<li>What are their expectations for the future?</li>\n<li>How are youth grouped in living units and programs?</li>\n<li>What activities are available in each facility?</li>\n<li>How accessible are social, emotional, and legal supports?</li>\n<li>What is the quality of the youth-staff relationships?</li>\n<li>How clear are the facility's rules?</li>\n<li>How clear is the facility's commitment to justice and due process?</li>\n<li>What methods of control and discipline do staff use?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>SYRP's findings are based on anonymous interviews with a nationally representative sample of youth in custody during the spring of 2003 using audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) technology.

The Survey of Youth in Residential Placement (SYRP) is the third addition to this constellation of surveys, which also includes the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) and the Juvenile Residential Facility Census (JRFC). Together, the three surveys on youth in custody collect and disseminate information that will assist OJJDP, other juvenile justice policymakers, and juvenile justice program administrators in their mission to provide appropriate, safe, and accountability-based programming for youth in custody. Unlike the CJRP and JRFC, which gather information from the facility administrators, the SYRP obtains information from the youth themselves through self-administered interviews.

The computer program automatically navigates to the next appropriate question based on the youth's earlier answers, storing all the data anonymously and securely. The method avoids literacy problems, encourages candid answers on sensitive topics, and permits strong privacy and confidentiality. Survey responses are never associated with youth's identities and delinked from facility identifiers before data are unencrypted for analysis. This meant that SYRP could ask youth about their experiences of violence and abuse without having sufficient information to provide actionable reports to child protection authorities."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The survey included 12 topical sections, covering youth's demographics, the living conditions in the facility, the offenses that led to their current custody placement, their previous use of drugs or alcohol and any substance counseling they received while in custody, emotional problems and symptoms and any couseling they received for these, their needs for medical services and use of medical services while in custody, their educational status and educational services received, their understanding of the facility's rules and their experiences of the application of these rules, their security while in custody including access to contraband, their experiences of victimization both while in their current placement and previously while living in a household, their prior convictions for offenses and any prior custody or probation, and their expectations for the future.</p>\n\n<p>SYRP also forged explicit links between the youth's interview answers and the information gathered in the normal cycles of the two census surveys by adapting and updating the latest CJRP and JRFC information for the SYRP sample.
