Implementation of a  redesigned NHIS, consisting of a basic module, a periodic module, and  a topical module, began in 1997 (see NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY,  1997 [ICPSR 2954]). The 2005 NHIS contains the Household, Family,  Person, Sample Adult and Sample Child files from the basic  module. Each record in the Household-level File (Part 1) contains data  on type of living quarters, number of families in the household  responding and not responding, and the month and year of the interview  for each sampling unit. The Family-level File (Part 2) is made up of  reconstructed variables from the person-level data of the basic module  and includes information on sex, age, race, marital status, Hispanic  origin, education, veteran status, family income, family size, major  activities, health status, activity limits, and employment status,  along with industry and occupation. As part of the basic module, the  Person-level File (Part 3) provides information on all family members  with respect to health status, limitation of daily activities,  cognitive impairment, and health conditions. Also included are data on  years at current residence, region variables, height, weight, bed  days, doctor visits, hospital stays, and health care access and  u\ntilization. A randomly-selected adult in each family was interviewed  for the Sample Adult File (Part 4) regarding respiratory conditions,  use of nasal spray, renal conditions, AIDS, joint symptoms, health  status, limitation of daily activities, and behaviors such as smoking,  alcohol consumption, and physical activity. The Sample Child File  (Part 5) provides information from an adult in the household on  medical conditions of one child in the household, such as respiratory  problems, seizures, allergies, and use of special equipment like  hearing aids, braces, or wheelchairs. Also included are variables  regarding child behavior, the use of mental health services, and  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as well as responses  to the SDQ-EX, which is the extended version of the Strengths and  Difficulties questionnaire on child mental health. The 2005 data  contain the Child Mental Health Brief (CMB), Child Mental Health  Services (CMS) and Child Influenza Immunization (CFI) sections. The  Injury/Poison Episode File (Part 6) is an episode-based file that  contains information about the external cause and nature of the injury  or poisoning episode and what the person was doing at the time of the  injury or poisoning episode, in addition to the date and place of  occurrence. The Injury/Poison Episode Verbatim File (Part 7) contains  edited narrative text descriptions of the injury or poisoning,  provided by the respondent. The Sample Adult Cancer File (Part 8) has  been added in 2005 and examines diet and nutrition, physical activity,  tobacco use, cancer screening, genetic testing, and family history.  Imputed income files for 2005 are now available through the NCHS Web site at www.cdc.gov/nhis."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"assistive devices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disabilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"doctor visits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hospitalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"illness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"immunization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"injuries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physical disabilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"poisoning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
