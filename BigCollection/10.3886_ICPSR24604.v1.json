A national sample of 1,249 adults was surveyed, including an oversample of African Americans and Latinos, for a total of 215 African Americans respondents and 186 Latino respondents. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling his job as president, and whether they approved of his handling of the war in Iraq and the economy.  Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way United States Congress as a whole was doing its job, as well as whether they approved of the way Republicans in Congress and Democrats in Congress were doing their jobs.  Opinions were sought on the amount that Congress had accomplished that year, and who could be trusted more, the Democrats or the Republicans, to do a better job handling the war in Iraq, health care, the United States campaign on terrorism, the economy, taxes, and the federal budget deficit. Questions were asked about the war in Iraq, including whether the war was worth fighting, and whether respondents thought the United States was making significant progress toward restoring civil order in Iraq. Respondents were also asked how closely they were following the 2008 presidential race, the probability that they would vote in the primary, for whom they would vote in the general election and their state's presidential primary if the election were held that day, their opinion of the candidates, who t\nhey trusted to handle various issues, whether they would vote for specific candidates if they won their party’s nomination, and what they felt was the most important issue in their choice for president. Opinions were sought on Bill Clinton and whether respondents felt comfortable with the idea of Clinton being a first husband and whether Clinton played a positive or negative role in Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.  Other topics included the state of the nation’s economy, the financial situation of the respondent’s family, and how respondents would spend a federal rebate check.  Demographic information includes voter registration status and participation history, sex, age, race, income, marital status, religious preference, religious service attendance, education level, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political philosophy, political party affiliation, and whether the respondent or anyone in the home was a military veteran."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Biden,

To achieve greater consistency and reduce the chance of large weights, ABC News in 2007 tested and evaluated iterative weighting, commonly known as raking or rim weighting, in which the sample is weighted sequentially to Census targets one variable at a time, continuing until the optimum distribution across variables (again, age, race, sex and education) is achieved. ABC News adopted rim weighting in January 2008.
