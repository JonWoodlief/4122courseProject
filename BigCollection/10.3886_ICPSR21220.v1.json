These surveys collected data on whether persons and households had experienced a criminal victimization during the previous six months.

First, to account for the possibility that the legal and social reforms that have taken place since the early 1970s may have altered the likelihood that victims or third parties report rape victimizations to the police, the analysis included a polytomous dependent variable that contrasts victim reported incidents and third-party reported (e.g., another member of the household, some nonlaw enforcement official, anybody else) incidents, respectively, with nonreported incidents.

Past research on police notification by victims of rape focused primarily on contrasting reporting rates between incidents involving strangers and nonstrangers.

In addition, the effects of more detailed relationship variables also were considered in this study.
