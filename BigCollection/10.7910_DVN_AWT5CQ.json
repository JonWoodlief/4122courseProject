In the first chapter, I describe how to make   causal inferences in the face of dynamic strategies. Traditional   causal inference methods assume that these dynamic decisions are   made all at once, an assumption that forces a choice between omitted   variable bias and post-treatment bias.  I resolve this dilemma by   adapting methods from biostatistics and use these methods to   estimate the effectiveness of an inherently dynamic process: a   candidate's decision to ``go negative.'' Drawing on U.S. statewide   elections (2000-2006), I find, in contrast to the previous   literature, that negative advertising is an effective strategy for   non-incumbents.    In the second chapter, I develop a method for handling measurement   error. Social scientists devote considerable effort to mitigating   measurement error during data collection but then ignore the issue   during data analysis.  Although many statistical methods have been   proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases, few have   been widely used because of implausible assumptions, high levels of   model dependence, difficult computation, or inapplicability with   multiple mismeasured variables.  This chapter develops an   easy-to-use alternative without these problems; it generalizes the   popular multiple imputation framework by treating missing   data problems as a special case of extreme measurement error and   corrects for both.    In the final chapter, I introduce a model for detecting changepoints   in the distribution of contributions to candidates over the course   of a campaign. This game-changers model is ideal for campaign   contributions data because it allows for overdispersion, a key   feature of contributions data. While many extant changepoint models   force researchers to choose the number of changepoint ex   ante, the game-changers model incorporates a Dirichlet process   prior in order to estimate the number of changepoints along with   th\neir location. I demonstrate the usefulness of the model in data   from the 2012 Republican primary and the 2008 U.S. Senate elections."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-05-10"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard University, Department of Government"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Blackwell, Matthew (2012).
