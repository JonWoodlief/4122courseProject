It introduced students to the process of reproducing published work.  Through replication, students became familiar with methods and learned to think about steps the author has made. Most importantly, students developed an understanding of what challenges and complications authors of published work have faced, and how they found a solution that is accepted in the scientific community. The workshop was created following examples by Gary King at Harvard and Victoria Stodden at Columbia University. To promote replication in university education, the syllabus, handouts and assignments are provided here. the workshop webpage is: http://schreiberin.de/teaching/replication.html and I also regularly blogged about the challenges and feedback from the project here: http://politicalsciencereplication.wordpress.com."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-05-16"},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["pdf"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Eight pdf files for each week.","label":"Handouts.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":66845,"categories":["Weekly Handouts"],"dataFile":{"id":2436145,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Handouts.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":1488820,"description":"Eight pdf files for each week.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:108412","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"18218e814c42d9e01271d99bb3f0fb99","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"18218e814c42d9e01271d99bb3f0fb99"}}},{"description":"Includes also literature list.","label":"Syllabus_Janz_Replication.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":66845,"categories":["Syllabus"],"dataFile":{"id":2436147,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Syllabus_Janz_Replication.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":119969,"description":"Includes also literature list.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:108414","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f700cab2ffd9b6d8942f961a02fdf6a6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f700cab2ffd9b6d8942f961a02fdf6a6"}}},{"description":"All assignments copied in one pdf.","label":"Weekly_Assignments.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":66845,"categories":["Weekly Assignments"],"dataFile":{"id":2436146,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Weekly_Assignments.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":139816,"description":"All assignments copied in one pdf.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:108413","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3fa5fad728404717c62661195df8de06","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3fa5fad728404717c62661195df8de06"}}}]}}}
