This study was based on data collected for the 224 census tracts in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1990 decennial Census for the years 1990 to 1997 and 1999 to 2001. Data on drug crimes for 1990 to 1997 and 1999 to 2001 were obtained from Cleveland Police Department (CPD) arrest records and used to produce counts of the number of drug offenses that occurred in each tract in each year and the number of arrestees for drug offenses who lived in each tract.

The main  objectives of the study were: (1) to identify neighborhoods in which  drug crimes were concentrated and neighborhoods where persons arrested  for drug crimes resided, (2) to describe changes in concentrations of  drug offending over time, and (3) to explain changes in patterns of  drug offending in relation to changes in the social and physical  structure of neighborhoods. The study looked at both the locations of  drug incidents and where drug offenders lived in order to explore  factors that bring residents from one neighborhood into other neighborhoods to engage in drug-related activities."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study used data collected for the 224 census  tracts in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1990 decennial census for the years  1990 to 1997 and 1999 to 2001. All of the data other than the United  States Census data and the drug crime data are available on-line from  the Center on Urban Poverty and Social Change's community database,  Cleveland Area Network for Data and Organizing (CAN DO). Data on drug  crimes for 1990 to 1997 and 1999 to 2001 were obtained from Cleveland  Police Department (CPD) arrest records. These records provided the  address of the incident and the residential address of the person  arrested. These addresses were geocoded into their 1990 census tracts,  with a match rate of over 95 percent, to produce counts of the number  of drug trafficking and possession incidents occurring within each  tract in each year and the number of arrestees for drug trafficking  and possession living in each tract. (Users should note that no  geocoded data are included in this dataset.) In 1998 the CPD changed  the way that drug crimes were recorded, and the accuracy with which  types of drug crimes were reported was significantly reduced. As a  result, while data on the total number of drug incidents in census  tracts were available for the entire length of the study, data on  whether these incidents involved drug trafficking or possession were  only available for 1990 to 1997. CPD arrest records for non-drug  crimes and Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court data were used to produce  count and rate data on non-drug crimes for each census tract. Data on  the social characteristics and housing conditions of each census tract  were gathered from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Migration into and out  of each tract between 1990 and 2000 was estimated using 1990 and 2000  Census population counts and Ohio Department of Health vital  statistics data on births and deaths from 1990 to 2000. Data on the  number of schools in each census tract were obtained from the  Cleveland Municipal School District. Several sources of data were used  to develop measures of the physical characteristics of areas. These  included the Cuyahoga County Auditor's\nparcel-level data (from 1990 to  2000) on land-use patterns, characteristics of dwellings, tax  delinquencies, and assessed value, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Act data (for 1992 to 2001) on home purchase loans and home improvement loans."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include 1990 census tract number, year,  the City of Cleveland Statistical Planning Area that each census tract  belonged to, counts and rates of violent crimes, robberies, robberies  with firearms, burglaries committed by adults in each census tract in  each year, robberies and violent crimes committed by juveniles in each  census tract in each year, number of drug trafficking and possession  incidents committed by City of Cleveland residents and by suburbanites  in each census tract in the years 1990 to 1997, number of residents of  each census tract for the years 1990 to 1997 arrested for drug  trafficking or possession, the total number of drug trafficking and  possession incidents committed in each census tract for every year of  the study, the total number of census tract residents arrested for  either drug trafficking or possession for every year of the study, the  number of residential, commercial, industrial, and vacant parcels in  each census tract and the number of non-vacant parcels that were tax  delinquent for 1990 to 1997, 1999, and 2000, the number of home  purchase and improvement applications that were made and approved in  each census tract in 1992 to 1997 and 1999 to 2001, the number of  elementary, middle, magnet, and high schools in each census tract in  each year, net migration for each census tract for each year, and 1990  and 2000 United States Census data on population, racial makeup,  number of people under 18 and over 65, home ownership, median income,  and the percent of householders who recently moved into the housing unit in selected years."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arrest records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arrests"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug law offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug possession"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug related crimes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug traffic"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"geographic distribution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhood change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhood characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
