The researchers identified 81 (46 women, 35 men) valedictorians, salutatorians, or top honors 1981 graduates from 33 high schools throughout Illinois. The participants were mostly White, except for 5 African Americans, 3 Latinos and 1 Asian American. Interviews were conducted each year from 1981-1984, and up to 4 more were conducted between 1985 and 1994. Survey data were also collected. In-depth interviews examined the participants' needs and sources of achievement, experiences that influenced academic achievement, and attitudes towards themselves, their families, their lives, and their futures. Quantitative data sources included a survey about student lifestyles and values collected in 1981 and 1990, 6 yearly updates, fact sheets, the Personal Attribute Questionnaire, Work and Family Orientation Questionnaire (the latter two collected in 1985), and a survey on educational and employment experiences, and personal and occupational values.\r\n<br /><br />The Archive holds the original interview transcripts, graduation addresses, fact sheets, updates, questionnaires, and correspondence for 81 participants. <br /><br />  <b>The paper data from this study are not yet available for use</b>"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Special aspects of education"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Education"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Murray Research Archive"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/logos/10/mra_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1995"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1980"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2000"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1981"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1994"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[]},"customMRA":{"displayName":"MRA Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"mraCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Education"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Deidentified Electronic Text Files","label":"1019ElectronicTextFiles","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":133108,"categories":["2.
