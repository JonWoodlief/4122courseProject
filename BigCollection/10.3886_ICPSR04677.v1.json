However, the  researchers focused particularly on state police for three reasons:  (1) historical data and literature about states' operational roles and  activities related to terrorism were absent, (2) new terrorism-related  activities that may be affecting more traditional and emerging state  police priorities needed to be examined, and (3) state police agencies  had historically been relatively neglected as the subjects of research  and policy work.

Survey items were developed from scratch since the project's focus was  to explore new developments. However, the research team reviewed and  utilized several existing surveys related to homeland security to  gather ideas about survey structure and wording. The project advisory  group reviewed the draft survey in December 2003, and their  suggestions were incorporated into the survey before the  implementation in 2004. The survey was conducted during the spring of  2004, and it was administered to all state police, highway patrol  agencies, and general-purpose state bureaus of investigation. Part 1,  State Law Enforcement Agency Data, provides survey responses from a  total of 64 agencies. Part 2, Local Law Enforcement Agency Data,  contains the results of the survey that was also sent to a sample  population of 400 local police and sheriff agencies. Each agency  received a survey that contained quantitative and qualitative items.  To achieve their response rates, the research team administered a  multimodal survey, using mailings and the Internet. Each targeted  agency received a mailed questionnaire in January 2004. A Web-based  instrument was also developed using Quask software. Respondents had  the choice of completing the questionnaire online or by mailing in  answers. Four weeks later, the research team mailed a reminder to all  agencies with outstanding responses and followed the mailing with phone calls to meet the desired response ra\ntes."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For Part 1, state agencies were asked since  September 11 how their allocation of resources to 18 operational law  enforcement responsibilities had changed, how their relationship with  federal agencies had changed across six items, and how their agency's  relationship with local law enforcement agencies had changed across  nine areas. Additionally, as contrasted with the period before  September 11, 2001, agencies were asked how their interaction with 18  specific federal agencies had changed, how their agencies' level of  involvement in 17 homeland security initiatives had changed, how the  homeland security mission affected individual state officer's or  investigator's duties and responsibilities, what degree of impact  homeland security had on nine organizational functions in their  agency, as well as how their agency's relationship with the private  sector had changed over five criteria. Similarly, questions in Part 2  inquired about local law enforcement agencies' allocation of resources  to 18 operational law enforcement responsibilities, how their  relationship with federal agencies had changed across six categories,  how their relationship with state law enforcement agencies had changed  across nine items, as well as how their agencies' interactions with 18  specific federal agencies had changed.
