The data in this collection were extracted from the 1976-1977 Merged Federal File produced by AUI Policy Research. Since some districts on the 1976-1977 Merged Federal File had consolidated by 1978-1979, NIE\nSpecial Tabulations data for these districts were combined. The Census data file was created in three steps. First, a skeleton file was created, containing one record for each school district on the 1978-1979 Merged Federal File. Each record on the skeleton file contained those data items in the School District Identification segment on the Merged Federal File. Second, the NIE Special Tabulations data were merged by the Office of Education (OE) state code and Local Education Agency (LEA) code to the skeleton file. Finally, Census Fifth Count records were merged by OE state code and LEA code to the skeleton file."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school districts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR I.A.1.b.
