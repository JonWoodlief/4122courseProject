The first is half-sampling of telephone numbers for which no address could be found. The second is RDD sampling rates proportional to the number of phone lines in the household. The third is minor oversampling of Chicago and Los Angeles due to early pilot surveys in these two cities. The fourth is short-term double-sampling of the four largest states (CA, NY, FL, and TX) and central region states. The fifth is under-sampling of households not covered by MSN TV. The sixth is oversampling of minority households (Black and Hispanic). Finally, the seventh weight is the selection of one adult per household. In order to calculate final weights, the researchers derived weighted sample distributions along various combinations of five variables. The first is gender (male, female). The second is age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 and over). The third is race/ethnicity (White, Black, other, Hispanic). The fourth is region (northeast, Midwest, south, west). Finally, the fifth variable is education (highest level achieved: less than high school, high school, some college, college degree or more). Similar distributions are calculated using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data and the Knowledge Network panel data. Cell-by-cell adjustments over the various univariate and bivariate distributions are calculated to make the weighted sample cells match those of the U.S. Census and the Knowledge Network panel."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The response rate was 72.0%."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Predictors_Activism_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43277,"dataFile":{"id":2300765,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Predictors_Activism_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":280557,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69564","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d4f569de9ebd77735811b4d72a1675bc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d4f569de9ebd77735811b4d72a1675bc"}}},{"description":"","label":"Predictors_Activism_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43277,"dataFile":{"id":2300766,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Predictors_Activism_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":134986,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69566","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","originalFileSize":104087,"UNF":"UNF:5:JnXBbjytDdRlZC7t4ymHXQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0d35ba8362c213f19663ddce3632ce97","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0d35ba8362c213f19663ddce3632ce97"}}},{"description":"","label":"Predictors_Activism_Questionnaire.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43277,"dataFile":{"id":2300764,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Predictors_Activism_Questionnaire.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":40409,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69565","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"8bf178357aca4249021275fbe7242249","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"8bf178357aca4249021275fbe7242249"}}}]}}}
