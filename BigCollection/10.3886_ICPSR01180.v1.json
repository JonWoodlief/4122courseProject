This research points out that analysts cannot attempt to  identify federal policy from the behavior of the federal funds futures  rate without making somewhat arbitrary additional assumptions. Also  studied is the predictive accuracy of a rule based on the federal  funds futures rate from October 1988 through August 1997 using an  assumption that is sufficient for partially identifying when the  market is expecting a federal action but not for predicting the  magnitude of the action. The forecasting rule correctly predicts a  target change at the one-month horizon only about one-third of the  time. The conclusion is that more research is needed, especially in  light of the Federal Open Market Commission's (FOMC) recent practice of disclosing polic\ny decisions immediately after FOMC meetings."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Federal Reserve System"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"monetary policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
