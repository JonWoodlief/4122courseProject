Each survey was conducted on May 11, July 7, and August 8, 2016 respectively. This Delphi survey included 20 persons who represent dental hygiene (seven groups of dental hygiene-related organizations). The primary survey was an open questionnaire that allowed experts to freely write their opinions. The secondary survey was a structured questionnaire, which categorized the detailed reasons presented by 20 experts in the primary survey. Specifically, the opinions were divided into categories in accordance with the studyâ€™s purpose and were then indicated using a 5-point Likert scale. The last survey showed the average, the standard deviation, and the quadrants of the results of the secondary survey, thus showing the general extent of agreement in expert opinion. Then, the response of each individual subject was displayed for comparison with the responses of the entire panel. The last round of surveys might show the same results as the secondary round, or might differ depending on the opinion of the panel. Additionally, minority opinions of the panel were important in the last questionnaire. If the response result was out of the quartile range, the subject was asked to write a brief justification to explain the discrepancy.
