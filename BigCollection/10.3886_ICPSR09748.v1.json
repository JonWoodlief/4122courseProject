The primary goals of the project were to   (1) describe state-established strategic planning processes, (2)   evaluate the strategies, (3) report on state reactions to the program,   and (4) make recommendations for improvement in strategic planning   processes. Five-state, on-site observation of planning processes and a   mail survey of all states and territories participating in the program   were conducted, as well as a review of all strategy submissions.   Variables in Part 1 include the Formula Grant Program's role in the   state and its relationship with other agencies, policy boards, and   working groups, the roles that these agencies play in Bureau of Justice   Assistance (BJA) strategy, funds allocated to local criminal justice   programs, and criteria used in selecting geographical areas of greatest   need. Variables from Part 2 relate to the variety and use of state   criminal justice data, difficulties in obtaining such data, federal   grant requirements, allocation of subgrants, and input of various   individuals and agencies in different stages of BJA strategy  development."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug laws"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"federal aid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"intervention strategies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
