The budget allowed for SPD to visit only 20,000  households. Thus, a sample cut was carried out similar to the 1998  sample cut. Roughly 19,100 households were sampled in this operation,  in order to account for an expected net five percent growth rate due  to household spawning. Interviewed and Type A, Type B, and Type D  noninterviewed households were eligible to be selected. The eligible  households were classified into six strata and then randomly selected  for the SPD 2002 sample such that each stratum took an approximately  equal proportional cut to reduce the total sample size to approximately 19,100."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The weights on this file are cross-sectional, therefore,  they are only valid for estimates of the characteristics of the  cohorts of people in 2002 who were represented by both the original  and nonoriginal sample people in the SPD 2002. An original sample  person is a sample person who was a self or proxy respondent in Wave 1  of the SIPP 1992 or 1993 panel. A nonoriginal sample person is a  sample person who became part of the sample after the SIPP Wave 1 and  beyond (including the SPD samples). The SIPP 1992 and 1993 Panel  samples, from which the SPD sample originated, w\nere designed to  produce only national estimates of the characteristics of interest to  the user. Although this 2002 cross-sectional file includes state  identifiers and is weighted to current state (as well as national)  controls, deriving subnational estimates from this nine-year-old  sample that has experienced severe attrition (household and person  nonresponse) and other sample loss (through death, being  institutionalized, etc.), as well as sample cuts dictated by budgetary  constraints, results in inadequate representativeness and poor  coverage in some of the smaller geographic areas. Even for the  national estimates, inadequate representativeness and poor coverage  occur in Black children aged 11 and below and Black adults aged 20 to  45. In addition to noninterview adjustment, we attempted to further  correct for these deficiencies by bringing back noninterviews from the  1997 Bridge sample and from a subset of the SIPP 1992 and 1993  Panels. These sample cases are included in this cross-sectional file,  and will be included in the third (and final) longitudinal file, as well."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD), 2002  Cross-Sectional File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41739,"dataFile":{"id":2661965,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD), 2002  Cross-Sectional File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
