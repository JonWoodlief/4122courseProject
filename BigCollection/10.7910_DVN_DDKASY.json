Out of 3314 undergraduate students in the sample, 2583 (77.9%) expressed their willingness to accept a free HIV test. More than two thirds (66.9%) of these subjects were females and the majority of respondents (94.5%) were Han. Of college students in this sample, nearly two fifths (37.4%) lived in the local city less than one year and about one third (31.0%) were freshmen. Nearly one half (48.2%) of our participants were medical students. To our surprise, 15.2% reported their sexual orientation is non-heterosexual and 55.9% spent less than one thousand Yuan on their monthly living expenses.\r\nHIV/AIDS-related knowledge was lacking with only 39.1% of participants answering more than 10 out of twelve questions correctly. Furthermore, stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV/AIDS were serious, since the number of correct responses that nearly half (45.5%) of the respondents responded to the 24 specific situations was no more than eighteen. The majority of college students mentioned at least one free HIV testing site and also recognized the necessity to provide a free HIV test in the local university (78.8% and 88.7%, respectively). Beyond our expectation, more than half (56.2%) of college students were ignorant of the \"Four Frees and One Care\" policy. Despite the fact that 18.9% of college students reported having had sexual behavior, only 49.5% perceived the risk of HIV infection.\r\nBivariable analysis \r\nThe results of the bivariable analysis were shown in Table 1. Those who expressed greater willingness to accept a free HIV test tended to be medical students,  higher levels of HIV-related knowledge, lower levels of stigma and discrimination, awareness of the \"Four Frees and One Care\" policy, knowledge of free HIV testing centers, recognition of the necessity to provide a free HIV test in the local university, and higher perception of the risk of HIV infection. No significant differences were reported between willingness and unwillingness in gender, race, grade, length of time, sexual orientation, monthly living expense, and history of sexual behavior.\r\nMultivariable logistic regression analysis\r\nThe stepwise multiple logistic regression model predicting willingness to accept a free HIV test was shown in Table 2. When all seven significant variables were included into the logistic regression model, only four variables (i.e., stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV/AIDS, knowledge of free HIV testing centers, recognition of the necessity to provide a free HIV test in the local university, perceived risk of HIV infection) remained statistically significantly related to willingness to participate in a free HIV test, while three variables including major, HIV-related knowledge, and awareness of the “Four Frees and One Care” policy lost their statistical significance, as indicated in Table 2.\r\nAmong all these four significant predictors, the odds ratio(OR) was the highest for recognition of the necessity to provide a free HIV test in the local university. The college students having recognized the necessity were more likely to express their willingness to accept to a free HIV test (OR=2.20, 95CI=1.73--2.80, P<0.001) than those having not recognized the necessity. The odds of willingness were 1.41 times (95CI=1.17--1.68, P<0.001) of respondents who had lower levels of stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV/AIDS, compared to that of those with high levels of stigma and discrimination. In addition, being more knowledgeable about free HIV testing centers (OR = 1.44, 95%CI=1.17--1.77, P<0.001) and having higher HIV risk perception (OR =1.64, 95%CI=1.37--1.95, P<0.001) were significantly associated with greater willingness to use VCT service."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Wang, Junfang"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-02-14"}]}},"files":[{"label":"article submission data set20180214.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":133517,"dataFile":{"id":3124260,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/DDKASY/GQRC05","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DDKASY/GQRC05","filename":"article submission data set20180214.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":220668,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16194388e0f-cf874bf9b76b","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:qm96UYzppba2ZAev1ZkY5A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2c584645196a427c47f503ba5b876b4c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2c584645196a427c47f503ba5b876b4c"}}},{"label":"defitions of variables final20180214.docx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":133517,"dataFile":{"id":3124261,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/DDKASY/ZKUADK","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DDKASY/ZKUADK","filename":"defitions of variables final20180214.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":18485,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1619438bc2e-a42bf78a1008","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"097a09da61c660b97f4e8c835354a6ff","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"097a09da61c660b97f4e8c835354a6ff"}}}]}}}
