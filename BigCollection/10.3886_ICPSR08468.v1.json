This study includes a detailed assessment of the strengths and   successes, weaknesses and failures of HMOs as perceived by their key   constituencies. This survey also obtained attitudes toward, and   knowledge of HMOs among the general public, as well as changes in those   attitudes. Other objectives include a comparison of different levels of   knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of HMOs among the public,   employers, and physicians both working in HMOs and non-HMO physicians.   Variables in the Corporate Employer file include familiarity with HMOs,   whether the company offers HMOs to employees, type of experience with   HMOs, incentives and drawbacks of HMOs, number of employees, industry   of the company, and number of years at present position of the   executive being interviewed. The Physicians file contains variables on   opinions and attitudes toward HMOs, whether the physician is an HMO   practitioner, the number of HMO patients seen in a week, changes in the   physician's practice caused by HMOs, primary speciality, number of   years in practice, and age. The Members of HMOs and Public   Cross-Section files contain variables on HMO membership, opinions on   services at HMOs, comparisons between HMOs and traditional services,   desire to join an HMO, health of respondent, occupation, education,  age, marital and financial status, and race."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health Maintenance Organizations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical specializations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"patient care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physician choice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physician practice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
