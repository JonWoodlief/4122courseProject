Simpson jury selectio\nn process. Respondents were asked whether they received a summons to appear for jury duty at the Los Angeles Superior Court on September 26, 1994, and how closely they followed the news coverage of O.J. Simpson and the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Specific questions included whether Simpson could get a fair trial in Los Angeles, whether the respondent had formed any opinions on the case, and whether the respondent, if appointed a juror, would have any difficulty in basing a judgment solely on evidence presented at the trial. Opinions were sought on the prosecution's and defense's strongest piece of information, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, and the validity of DNA and other scientific testimony. Other topics included opinions on the criminal justice system and police officers in Los Angeles, with specific focus on possible biases against Blacks. Background information includes voter registration status, household composition, vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
