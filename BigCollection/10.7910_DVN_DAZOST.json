A two-stage sampling procedure was applied and the sample was stratified, clustered and selected to meet the requirements of probability sampling. The Master Sample is based on the 1996 Population Census enumerator areas and the estimated number of dwelling units from the 1996 Population Census. The EAs were grouped within a province by urban/rural, and a disproportional sample of EAs was taken from each group (stratum). Within each explicit stratum the PSUs were stratified by simply arranging them in geographical order by District Council, Magisterial District\r\nand, within the magisterial district, by average household income (for formal urban areas and hostels) or EA. The allocated number of EAs was systematically selected with probability proportional to size in each stratum. The sample was explicitly stratified by province and area type (urban/rural).\r\n\r\nThe careful and scientific selection of the PSUs was the first stage of the sample selection. These PSUs then need accurate identification in the field, particularly the boundaries of the PSUs. These identified PSUs must match those areas selected from 1996 census records. After boundary identification the next stage is to list accurately all the dwelling units in the PSU. A PSU is either one EA from the Census or several EAs when the number of dwelling units in the base or originally selected EA from the census was found to have less than 100 dwelling units. Each EA should have approximately 150 dwelling units but it was found that many contained less than that. Thus, in some cases it has been found necessary to add EAs to the original EA to give our minimum requirement of 100 dwelling units in the first stage of primary sampling units (PSUs).\r\nPSUs in the Master Sample consist of 100 to 2445 dwelling units. Special dwellings such as all prisoners in prisons, patients in hospitals, people residing in boarding houses and hotels (whether temporary or semipermanent), guest houses (whether catering or self-catering), schools and churches are excluded from the sample.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of the sample selection is from the dwelling unit listing. A systematic sample of 10 dwelling units was drawn from each PSU. However, if there was growth of more than 20% in a PSU, then the sample size was increased systematically according to the proportion of growth in the PSU. The same dwellings will be visited on, at most, five different occasions. After this, new dwelling units will be included for interviewing from the same PSU in the Master sample. This means a rotation of 20% of dwelling units\r\neach time the LFS is conducted."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured and open ended questions"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A two-stage weighting procedure was done on LFS February 2002. The first stage weighted the results to separate estimates of the population size, based on the population census of October 1996, as adjusted by a post-enumeration survey (PES).
