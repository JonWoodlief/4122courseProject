Respondents were also queried on whether they thought immigration was a good thing or bad thing for their country, whether they considered themselves to be a religious or non-religious person, whether they or their family had not had enough to eat in the last twelve months, whether they had done any voluntary work in the past year, and whether they thought the world would be more peaceful next year than in the past year. Finally, respondents were asked whether economy-related protests and industrial disputes in their country would increase or decrease in 2012, and to give their opinion on a number of different organizations such as the World Health Organization, United Nations, World Economic Forum, Transparency International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Additional questions included the respondent's assessment of their ability to read and understand a simple newspaper story and to write a simple letter in the English language.
