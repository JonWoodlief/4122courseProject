The American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College tested the hypotheses that SANE/SART exams increase arrest and prosecution rates. The researchers collected case information from SANE/SART, police, and prosecution files in three jurisdictions: Monmouth County (Freehold), New Jersey, Sedgwick County (Wichita), Kansas, and Suffolk County (Boston), Massachusetts. At each study site, the project team randomly selected up to 125 sexual assault cases in which there was a SANE or SART intervention and 125 cases in which there was no SANE/SART intervention from cases that were opened and closed between 1997 and 2001. Comparisons were sought between SANE/SART cases (both SANE only and SANE/SART combined) and non-SANE/SART cases to determine if the intervention predicted the likelihood of certain criminal justice system outcomes. These outcomes included identification/arrest of a suspect, the filing of charges, case disposition, type of penalty, and length of sentence. In addition, researchers collected information on a number of other variables that could impact or mitigate the effect of SANE/SART interventions and case outcomes. The researchers abstracted information from case files maintained by SANE programs, police incident/arrest reports, and prosecution files during intensive five-day site visits. Three standardized records abstraction forms were developed to collect data: (1) the incident form was designed to collect data from police reports and the prosecution files about the actual sexual assault, (2) the case abstraction form was designed to collect prosecution data and case outcome data from the prosecutors' case files, and (3) the SANE/SART data collection form collected information from the SANE/SART files about the SANE/SART intervention.

The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of SANE/SART programs as a tool in the criminal justice system. The American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College tested the hypotheses that SANE/SART exams increase arrest and prosecution rates. In testing this hypothesis, the project team sought to answer five primary research questions: (1) Is the arrest rate higher in cases where a SANE/SART exam is performed as compared with cases in which no exam is performed?, (2) Is the indictment/charging rate higher in such cases?, (3) Are guilty pleas more likely to be entered in such cases, and are pleas likely to be to the existing charge or to a lesser charge?, (4) Is the conviction rate higher in such cases?, and (5) Is the sentence more severe in such cases?</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the project team examined the participation of victims in the criminal justice process and the types of services that were offered them. As a large portion of SANE/SART programs focus on understanding victims' reactions to sexual assault and ensuring proper treatment to minimize the chance of further trauma, a central hypothesis to be tested was that improved case outcomes may be a result of increased participation by the victim in the identification, apprehension, and prosecution of the perpetrator. Moreover, the level of services offered and provided to victims, particularly those related to prosecution would likely affect case outcomes as well.

However, due to some challenges, the study team reduced the proposed number of study sites to three. The final sites were determined based on availability of data and likelihood of obtaining a sufficient non-SANE sample. Therefore, the study team selected sites where the SANE program was implemented in the late 1990's, thus making it possible to collect a sufficient number of non-SANE cases. As a result, the three study sites selected for the study were Sedgwick County (Wichita), Kansas, Suffolk County (Boston), Massachusetts, and Monmouth County (Freehold), New Jersey. Cases that were opened and closed between 1997 and 2001 were randomly selected from police incident reports in New Jersey and Kansas and the state crime lab in Massachusetts, as all sexual assault reports were automatically sent to the crime lab. From those data sources, the project team obtained a list of adult female sexual assault reports during that time period. Data collected from the police incident forms were from the largest police departments in the participating jurisdictions. Staff from the SANE/SART program in each jurisdiction reviewed the list and identified all cases in which a SANE/SART exam was performed. The project team then split the list into two groups (non-SANE/SART cases and SANE/SART cases) and then randomly selected up to 125 cases in each category. In total, data were collected on 530 cases (108 SANE cases, 151 SANE/SART, and 271 non-SANE cases).</p>\n\n<p>Although every attempt was made to follow the random selection and matching protocol, the sampling strategy was not able to be implemented in one site because the prosecutor's office tracked cases by victim and defendant name, not by a police report or incident number. Working with the police department and the state crime lab, a list of adult female sexual assault victims was identified. The police department and a SANE nurse culled the list into a SANE and a non-SANE sample and provided the l\nist of victim names to the prosecutor's office so files could be matched. Once the match occurred, a unique case identifier was assigned to the file to maintain victim anonymity and confidentiality.</p>\n\n<p>This study focused on the impact of SANE/SART interventions on the formal criminal justice response, not the victim's decision or likelihood to report the assault to the police or to obtain services. As such, the cases examined were only those in which a report had been made to law enforcement. The victims may or may not have had a SANE/SART intervention, which served as the theoretically relevant independent variable in the study. The research team collected data that allowed the team to control for any selection bias that may have arisen from cases not processed through the SANE/SART system.</p>\n\n<p>The major impact of using only three sites is on the ability to generalize to a larger population. Because of contextual differences and the smaller sample size, comparisons of differences between SANE only, SANE/SART, and non-SANE/SART cases across all sites is recommended rather than within-site and cross-site comparisons.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record abstracts"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"none"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Not applicable."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Testing the Efficacy of the SANE-SART Programs in Kansas, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, 1997-2001","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37100,"dataFile":{"id":2624410,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Testing the Efficacy of the SANE-SART Programs in Kansas, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, 1997-2001","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
