The study included 130 participants consisting of 45 pre-World War II immigrants, 40 post-World War II immigrants, 26 U.S.-born Filipino-Americans, and 19 mixed-parentage Filipino-Americans. The sample consisted of residents of Salinas, CA in the late 1970s/early 1980s.\r\n<br /><br />  In-depth interviews were conducted at the participants' home. Interviews included open-ended questions which were taped. Participants were asked about immigration experiences, ethnic identity, social relations, acculturation, economic relations, and family relationships. A Korean community hearing and a Filipino community hearing are also included in the data. The hearings were public meetings between government officials and ethnic communities; topics discussed included unemployment, poverty, housing, schools, healthcare, elderly programs, youth programs, legal services and immigration services.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogous materials for this study: data for 45 of the 130 original participants in both audiotape and electronic text file formats.
