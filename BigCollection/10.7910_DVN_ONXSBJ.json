Thus, this study presents a profile analysis of teachers working in the field of Education Degree in the state of Goiás, in view of the challenges of teacher training and interdisciplinary significantly, aiming to contribute to overcoming them. For data collection, there was analysis of Lattes the twenty-three teachers of the two campuses of the Federal University of Goiás that teach in degree in Rural Education. It is noteworthy that throughout the state, only these two campuses offer that degree and both major in Natural Sciences. The following categories were analyzed: Education / degree, additional training, Professional Practice, Research Projects / Extension and Productions. The results showed that most teachers joined as trainers without presenting involvement with the Rural Education theme, that involvement started to happen after the start of activities in the course, mainly in the areas research projects / extension, and quite different between the two campuses the Regional I presented a greater number of teachers and activities on the theme that regional II. This demonstrates the lack of teachers who have dedicated themselves over training the Rural Education, besides highlighting the little evidence of this theme in teacher training courses. The good thing is that teachers began to look into the issue, showing that these teachers are learning and researching the multiple faces of Rural Education, or are having identity and dedication, on the other hand should reflect that this early involvement along with the implementation of the course, making the teaching profession more prone to errors.
