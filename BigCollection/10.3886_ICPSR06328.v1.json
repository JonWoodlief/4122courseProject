Respondents   were questioned regarding their intentions to vote in the election,   their current vote choices in the election, their opinions of the   candidates, and their impressions of Dinkins' and Giuliani's leadership   qualities, concern for the needs and problems of average New Yorkers,   potential impact on race relations and the economy, toughness in   dealing with crime, trustworthiness to deal with problems, and   fairness. Respondents were asked to identify the problem they most   wanted the next mayor to concentrate on, to evaluate David Dinkins'   performance as mayor compared with past New York City mayors, to assess   his treatment of Jews and Blacks, and to indicate whether Ed Koch's   endorsement of Rudolph Giuliani would influence their v\note. Respondents   were also asked if Dinkins and Giuliani were spending more time   attacking each other or explaining what they would do if elected,   whether Dinkins or Giuliani was more responsible for negative   campaigning, whether the candidates for mayor should be required to   participate in televised debates, and whether George Marlin, the   Conservative Party and Right-to-Life Party candidate, should also be   included in the debates. Additional questions dealt with the 1993   elections for comptroller and public advocate, the city economy, race   relations, personal safety, drugs in the respondents' neighborhoods,   Bill Clinton's handling of his job as president, and whether Clinton's   statement that many people are not willing to vote for people different   from themselves is true of many New Yorkers. Background information on   respondents includes voter registration status, financial situation   compared to four years ago, political party, political orientation,   vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, vote choice in the 1989   New York City mayoral election, borough of residence, labor union   status, religious preference, education, age, sex, race, Hispanic  origin, Italian origin, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
