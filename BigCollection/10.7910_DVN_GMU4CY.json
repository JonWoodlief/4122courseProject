It is a necessary condition for weak sustainable development that genuine\r\nsaving not be persistently negative. However, according to data provided by the World\r\nBank, resource-rich countries are systematically failing to meet this condition. Alongside\r\nthe well-known resource curse on economic growth, resource abundance might have\r\na negative effect on genuine saving. In fact, the two are closely related, as future\r\nconsumption growth is limited by insufficient genuine saving now. In this paper, we\r\napply the most convincing conclusion from the literature on economic growth – that it\r\nis institutional failure that depresses growth – to data on genuine saving. We regress\r\ngross and genuine saving on three indicators of institutional quality in interaction with\r\nan indicator of resource abundance. The indicators of institutional quality are corruption,\r\nbureaucratic quality and the rule of law. We find that reducing corruption has a positive\r\nimpact on genuine saving in interaction with resource abundance. That is, the negative\r\neffect of resource abundance on genuine saving is reduced as corruption is reduced."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-21"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for EDE (GS) final.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79362,"dataFile":{"id":2776319,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/GMU4CY/73HXQJ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GMU4CY/73HXQJ","filename":"Article for EDE (GS) final.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":2869,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:152637b1006-4b5971a9b5b9","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ad5517b2cca2deacf981532a41ef7331","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ad5517b2cca2deacf981532a41ef7331"}}},{"label":"Article for Environment and Development Economics.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79362,"dataFile":{"id":2776318,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/GMU4CY/KHQUWN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GMU4CY/KHQUWN","filename":"Article for Environment and Development Economics.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3610089,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:152637b9915-2453decfc360","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:w26KqFepQu4sz91dTXrJBQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"aa22d07e98ff70e176328803e7768f93","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"aa22d07e98ff70e176328803e7768f93"}}}]}}}
