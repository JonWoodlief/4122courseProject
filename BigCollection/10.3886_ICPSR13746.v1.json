In particular, the  project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,  adult crime, substance abuse, and violence.

The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into  343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of  racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.  The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were  composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic  boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered  in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately  8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample  of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21  strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with  the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to  eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic  status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected  at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing  of dwelling\nunits was collected for all sampled block groups.  Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts  (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through  in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the  80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within  six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were  selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of  8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the  eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data  collection, 5,338 were interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection, and  4,850 were interviewed in the Wave 3 data collection.</p>\n\n<p>Data collection for Wave 3 began in 2000 and ended in 2002. It  included a letter sent to study participants notifying them that they  would be contacted to schedule an interview. Additional information on  the contact log included the dates and research assistant ID of the  Wave 2 interview (or the status of the case if incomplete in Wave 2),  a list of household composition and ID numbers of other household  members in the study, the name the telephone was listed under, the  recontact information from Waves 1 and 2, and an updated history of  addresses.</p>\n\n<p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the  child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to  spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research  assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child  interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face  interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the  personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated  telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in  Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 3 who lived  outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants  were able to travel for interviews. In Wave 3, phone interviews were  also conducted with the study participants in Cohort 15. People who  refused to complete the two-hour in-person interview were administered  the phone interview. A total of 391 telephone interviews were  conducted during Wave 3, representing 6.3 percent of the sample.</p>\n\n<p>Proxy interviews were conducted with study participants who were  emancipated minors (under 18 but married or living independently). The  study participants answered questions from the primary caregiver's  interview on the primary caregiver's behalf. In Wave 3, one primary  caregiver and eleven study participants (young adults) were  interviewed in jail. They were located in either the Cook County Jail  or in one of the state prisons. Those study participants in a state  system outside the nine-county area were also interviewed by phone.  Study participants in foster care could not be interviewed. The  Department of Children and Family Services did not allow interviews of  the foster parent or the child. Permission was granted for a brief  period in Wave 1, therefore there are some children in the sample who  could not be followed up in Waves 2 and 3. Some children were not in  foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in foster care by Wave 2 or  3. They were also not followed up. Lastly, some participants were  interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as they were in foster care  during Wave 2.</p>\n\n<p>Some participants in Wave 1 spoke a language other than English,  Spanish, or Polish. In Wave 3, an abbreviated version of the primary  caregiver's protocol was administered, and the research assistant  arranged for someone in the household to translate on the spot. In  Wave 3, the complete protocol was translated into Spanish.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the age and wave of data collection, participants were  paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other incentives, such as free  passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes, were also  i\nncluded.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For  example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking  traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,  delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and  self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also  interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,  parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental  health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>\n\n<p>For primary caregivers included in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, an  addendum interview was administered consisting of measures or portions  of measures from the Wave 2 interview. An addendum was also given to  the Cohort 15 and 18 study participants who were not included in Wave  2. A total of 164 primary caregivers and 62 young adult (Cohorts 15  and 18) addendums were completed in Wave 3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Things I Can Do If I Try</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Things I Can Do If I Try survey was a self-efficacy instrument  designed for children.
