Under the new structured sentencing law  parole was eliminated, and a sentencing commission developed  recommended ranges of punishment for offense and offender categories,  set priorities for the use of correctional resources, and developed a  model to estimate correctional populations. This study sought to  investigate sentencing reforms by looking at the effects of structured  sentencing on multiple aspects of the adjudication process in North  Carolina. A further objective was to determine whether there were  differences in the commission of institutional infractions between  inmates sentenced to North Carolina prisons under the pre-structured  versus structured sentencing laws. Researchers hoped that the results  of this study may help North Carolina and jurisdictions around the  country (1) anticipate the likely effects of structured sentencing  laws, (2) design new laws that might better achieve the jurisdictions'  goals, and (3) improve the potential of sentencing legislation in  order to enhance public safety in an effective and equitable  way. Administrative records data were collected from two  sources. First, in order to examine the effects of structured  sentencing on the adjudication process in North Carolina, criminal  case data were obtained from the North Carolina Administrative Office  of the Courts (Parts 1 and 2). The pre-structured sentencing and  structured sentencing samples were selected at the case level, and  each record in Parts 1 and 2 represents a charged offense processed in  either the North Carolina Superior or District Court. Second, inmate  records data were collected from administrative records provided by  the North Carolina Department of Correction (Part 3). These data were  used to compare the involvement in infractions of inmates sentenced  under both pre-structured and structured sentencing. The data for Part  3 focused on inmates entering the prison system between June 1, 1995,  and January 31, 1998. Variables for Parts 1 and 2 include type of  charge, charged offense date, method of disposition (e.g., dismissal,  withdrawal, jury trial), defendant's plea, verdict for the offense,  and whether the offense was processed through the North Carolina  Superior or District Court. Structured sentencing offense class and  modified Uniform Crime Reporting code for both charged and convicted  offenses are presented for Parts 1 and 2. There are also county,  prosecutorial district, and defendant episode identifiers in both  parts. Variables related to defendant episodes include types of  offenses within episode, total number of charges and\nconvictions,  whether all charges were dismissed, whether any felony charge resulted  in a jury trial, and the adjudication time for all charges. Demographic  variables for Parts 1 and 2 include the defendant's age, race, and  gender. Part 3 variables include the date of prison admission,  sentence type, number of prior incarcerations, number of years served  during prior incarcerations, maximum sentence length for current  incarceration, jail credit in years, count of all infractions during  current and prior incarcerations, reason for incarceration, infraction  rate, the risk for alcohol and drug dependency based on alcohol and  chemical dependency screening scores, and the number of assault,  drug/alcohol, profanity/disobedience, work absence, and money/property  infractions during an inmate's current incarceration. Demographic  variables for Part 3 include race, gender, and age at the time of each inmate's prison admission."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Over the past three decades, many major reforms  have occurred in the United States concerning adjudication and  sentencing policies and practices. While there have been various  studies investigating the impacts of sentencing reform, the focus of  these studies has been largely limited to topics such as compliance  with changes, sentencing disparity, sentencing patterns, and the  impacts on correctional populations. Research addressing the effects  of sentencing reform on the criminal justice process itself was  lacking. Effective October 1, 1994, the state of North Carolina  implemented a new structured sentencing law that applied to all felony  and misdemeanor crimes (except for driving while impaired) committed  on or after October 1, 1994. The purposes of the new structured  sentencing law were (1) to increase the effectiveness of the  sanctioning process, (2) to improve consistency and fairness for  offenders, (3) to promote truth in sentencing, and (4) to make more  efficient use of the state's prosecution, adjudication, and  correctional resources. Under the new structured sentencing law parole  was eliminated, and a sentencing commission developed recommended  ranges of punishment for offense and offender categories, set  priorities for the use of correctional resources, and developed a  model to estimate correctional populations. At the time of data  collection for this study, the sentencing commission had tracked  sentences and other aspects of structured sentencing, but had limited  resources to study the effects of the new law on the criminal justice  system. This study sought to investigate sentencing reforms by looking  at the effects of structured sentencing on multiple aspects of the  adjudication process in North Carolina. A further objective was to  determine whether there were differences in the commission of  institutional infractions between inmates sentenced to North Carolina  prisons under the pre-structured versus structured sentencing  laws. Researchers hoped that the results of this study may to help  North Carolina and jurisdictions around the country (a) anticipate the  likely effects of structured sentencing laws, (b) design new laws that  might better achieve their individual intended goals, and (c)  ultimately improve the potential of sentencing legislation in order to enhance public safety in an effective and equitable way."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Administrative records data were collected from  two sources. First, pre-structured (Part 1) and structured (Part 2)  samples were selected at the case level from criminal case data  obtained from the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts.  The pre-structured sample represents cases during the time prior to  structured sentencing going into effect. The structured sample was  used directly in examining the effects structured sentencing had on  the adjudication process in North Carolina. Each record in Parts 1 and  2 represents a charged offense processed in\neither the North Carolina  Superior or District Court. Because some offenses were processed at  both the district and superior court levels, an individual offense  could be represented by more than one record. To obtain an  unduplicated count of offenses, researchers distinguished between  \"interim\" and \"noninterim\" records for every offense. Interim records  were defined as offense records that did not include a final  disposition. For a superior court offense record, INTERIM=1 if the  offense was remanded to district court or withdrawn from superior  court. For a district court offense record, INTERIM=1 if the offense  was bound or appealed to superior court (and was not remanded back to  district court or withdrawn from superior court). Each record in Parts  1 and 2 carries a defendant identifier (DEFENDID) and a defendant  episode identifier (DEFEPIID), which link together all charged offense  records for a defendant or a defendant episode. Researchers conducted  all of their analyses at this defendant episode level. To create  defendant episodes, researchers linked together all charges for a  defendant within a prosecutorial district, regardless of the case with  which it was associated, for which the adjudication interval (dates  from initial charged offense to disposition) overlapped. Under this  scheme, some defendants had more than one defendant episode. If, for  example, a defendant had multiple offenses charged and disposed within  a six-week interval, and then had another group of offenses charged  two months later, researchers considered each set of offenses as a  separate defendant episode and analytic unit. The second source of  administrative records data was the North Carolina Department of  Correction inmate records (Part 3). These data were used to compare  the involvement in infractions of inmates sentenced under both  pre-structured and structured sentencing. These data focused on  inmates entering the prison system between June 1, 1995, and January  31, 1998. Data for Part 3 include only those infractions that resulted  in a conviction, so infractions not formally recognized and  adjudicated by prison authorities were excluded from analyses. Inmates  serving mixed sentences, life sentences and those incarcerated for drinking while intoxicated (DWI) were also excluded."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables for Parts 1 and 2 include type of charge,  charged offense date, method of disposition (e.g., dismissal,  withdrawal, jury trial), defendant's plea, verdict for the offense,  and whether the offense was processed through the North Carolina  Superior or District Court.
