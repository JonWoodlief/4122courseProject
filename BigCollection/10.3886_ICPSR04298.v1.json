The project analyzes qualitative data in an  existing database that was collected by the  Quality in Linking Together  (QUILT) Early Education Partnerships\n<a href=\"http://www.nccic.org/quilt/\">http://www.nccic.org/quilt/</a>\ninitiative. The QUILT  database was designed to provide training and technical assistance in  the development and sustainment of partnerships to professionals  across the nation, including early care and education providers and  state leaders. It is divided into two sections: state-level and local  provider-level information. Both sections contain narratives, factual  data, and documents. Additionally, the project collected new  quantitative and qualitative data from randomly selected child care  and Head Start providers in Ohio to study the influence of  partnerships on the quality of and access to services.</p>\n\n<p>The Partnership Impact Research Project explored questions about  partnerships and their impact on child care and parents while  attempting to determine whether state actions could influence both the  development of provider-level partnerships and the processes  partnerships engage in to sustain their work. Specifically, the study  was designed to address the following objectives:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Conduct a qualitative analysis of data in an existing database  to assess the nature of partnerships and state actions to support  partnerships.</li>\n<li>Conduct a longitudinal study that uses a quasi-experimental  design and involves original data collection at three points in time  to learn about the impact of partnerships on child care center  quality, child care classroom quality, and accessibility of services  for parents.</li>\n<li>Develop detailed reports and research briefs, tailored to  specific audiences such as legislators, administrators, and providers,  that translate research findings into practical information that  addresses questions frequently asked about child care partnerships.</li>\n<li>Disseminate research reports and briefs through established  networks of policy makers and practitioners, using their  organizations' Web sites and publications.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The six datasets associated with this data collection are  summarized below:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Child Care Center Data -- contains information on a variety of  aspects about a child care center from the director's point of view  with many focused questions aimed at the preschool population and an  overview of the child care center as a whole. This dataset provides  information about the population being served, services provided,  teacher ratios, teacher training and education, annual budgets,  funding sources, and other major aspects of a child care center in  order to achieve an understanding of quality.</li>\n<li>Child Care Center Partnership Data -- contains information about  the child care partnership with the Head Start Agency that provides  their services. There are five sections: funding sources, origins of  the partnership, resources, nature of the partnership, and  benefits/challenges. Information about how the partnership began, what  the centers' role is, what services are provided, and a variety of  general questions that inform others about the nature of the  partnership are available in this dataset.</li>\n<li>Head Start Background Data -- contains background information  about a Head Start Agency that partners with child care centers and  other information related to budget, funding sources, number of  children served, and Head Start program organization.</li>\n<li>Head Start Partnership Data -- a companion to the Head Start  Background data, this dataset contains information about the specific  partnership with each child care center the agency is involved  with. There are four sections: background information, teacher  training/professional development, services, and director  information. Additionally, information on how the partnership began,  what the agency's role is, what services are provided, and other  general questions about the partnership is available.</li>\n<li>Parent Data -- contains information on parents' views of the  child care center that their preschooler attends. This dataset  provides information about the population being served including  home/school connection, how a parent views the classroom and the care  being provided by the center, and the services available to both the  child and parent through the center.</li>\n<li>Teacher Data -- contains information about teachers' views of the  child care center where they are employed. This dataset provides  information about the population being served, services provided,  teacher ratios, teacher training and education, and teacher experience in order to achieve an understanding of quality.</li>\n</ol>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"n/a"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The Partnership Impact Research Project adopted  the QUILT project's taxonomy to categorize local partnership  structures into three types:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One organization blends multiple funding streams.</li>\n<li>Two or more organizations blend funding and resources.</li>\n<li>An organization blends funds with a family child care  provider.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Year One of the study focused on a qualitative analysis to explain  partnership approaches at the state and local levels and to produce a  report for national dissemination to a variety of audiences. During  project Year Two and Year Three, the focus was on the influence of  provider-level partnership practices on quality and access.</p>\n\n<p>Year One Methodology</p>\n\n<p>During the first year of the project, a standardized case study  approach was used to analyze the state- and provider-level data in the  QUILT partnership profiles database. Additionally, research literature  about partnerships was reviewed as well as studies of state early care  and education funding and policies. Two re\nsearch questions framed the  Year One analysis and writing: (1) How are states across the country  supporting and promoting early care and education partnerships? (2)  How are early care and education providers engaging in partnerships?  To address these questions, two separate case studies were utilized:</p>\n\n<p>State-Level Case Study: Data sources included reviews of documents  produced by national organizations and by states as well as interviews  with state child care administrators, Head Start-State Collaboration  directors, state pre-k directors, and directors of agencies  responsible for early care and education services. The state factual  data include links to state early care and education web pages, state  demographics, child care licensing regulations, eligibility criteria  for early education programs, funding for early education programs,  and numbers served, all of which are from secondary sources such as  the census.</p>\n\n<p>Provider-Level Case Study: Data came from the 65 partnership  profiles in the database and provided factual information for each.  Questions focused on: partnership approach, partnership hours and  days, number of children served by the partnership, total numbers  served by the center, ages of children served by the partnership and  by partnering organizations, funding used to support the partnership,  partnership setting, services offered, and the primary objective for  partnering.</p>\n\n<p>Years Two and Three Methodology</p>\n\n<p>The second and third years of the project continued to examine the  qualitative data across cross-cutting themes while also addressing  questions about the influence of partnership on quality and  access. In-depth longitudinal data collection continued and follow-up  data was gathered from child care directors, teachers, parents, and  from directors of Head Start programs partnering with child care  centers. This portion of the project focused on: partnership  processes, quality of services, parental access to services, duration  of partnership, benefits/challenges of partnership, and child care  quality. Additionally, detailed briefs were developed aimed at  addressing specific questions posed by different audiences such as policymakers and providers.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"classroom environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"early childhood education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Early Head Start"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"funding"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Head Start"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"low income groups"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preschool children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preschool education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"schools"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher qualifications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher student relationship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teaching conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CCEERC II.
