Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy, as well as their views on United States and NATO involvement in the\nKosovo war between the Albanians and the Serbs. Respondents were asked if they had viewed the televised address, given by President Clinton on March 24, about why the United States and NATO were conducting air strikes against Serbia. Those queried were asked if they followed the news, if they favored the air strikes, if they understood the situation in Kosovo, and if the United States should be involved. Views were also sought on whether United States involvement in Kosovo would damage relationships with other foreign countries, particularly Russia. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, political party, political orientation, voter participation history, marital status, age of children in household, family income, and computer access."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
