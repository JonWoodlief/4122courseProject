The study also  included surveys of probationers, parolees, and inmates on  transitional supervision who had attended a lever-pulling meeting  (Part 4). The primary goal of the lever-pulling meetings was to have  the meeting attendees \"spread the word\" about what TimeZup was all  about. Surveys were distributed to the meeting attendees from March  2000 to February 2001. A total of 216 surveys was distributed and  129 were completed.  To measure the impact of TimeZup on public fear,  Spectrum Associates conducted a baseline survey in the fall of 1998  with 600 adult New Haven residents on their feelings about New Haven.  The survey was repeated with 250 adult New Haven residents in the fall of 2001 (Part 5)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables in Part 1, Firearm Crimes, include the  year, month, date, and time of the incident, the type of crime  (assault, murder, or robbery) and in which police precinct the crime  occurred.

Part 3, Firearms Seized, includes variables on the year and type  of weapon seized. Variables in Part 4, Offender Meeting Atendee  Survey, include the date and location of the meeting,  whether the respondent was on probation, parole or in transitional  supervision, the respondents' perception of the meeting, the extent to  which the respondent was worried about being on the \"List,\" the amount  of impact the respondent felt the initiative would have on New Haven's  gun problem, the likelihood of the respondent contacting the community  services presented at the meeting, whether or not the respondent had  informed friends and family about the initiative/what they were doing at  the meeting, whether or not the respondent had warned friends and  family about the \"List.\" and the number of people the respondent had  told about the initiative. Part 5, Resident Phone Survey, includes  demographic variables on the respondent such as age, gender,  ethnicity, highest level of education, employment status, h\nousehold  income, marital status, and how long they had lived in New Haven.  Respondents were asked about their overall perceptions of New Haven  and their satisfaction with the quality of life in New Haven. They  were then asked to rate whether each of the following was \"not a  problem,\" a \"minor problem,\" or a \"major problem\": public  transportation, youth gangs, the quality of New Haven's schools,  rundown or neglected buildings, prostitution, homeless sleeping on  sidewalks or benches, violent crime committed with guns, and illegal  drug use. Respondents were asked if they or any member of their  household had been the victim of street crime, their level of fear  about being a victim of street crime, any changes in their level of  fear, and what type of street crime they feared the most. Respondents  were also asked if their neighborhood faced problems with abandoned  cars or buildings, rundown and neglected building, poor lighting,  trash, empty lots, public drinking and drug use, public drug sales,  vandalism or graffiti, prostitution, begging, loitering, kids skipping  school, homeless people sleeping on streets, and people carrying or  using guns. They were then asked if the existence of these problems  made their neighborhood feel less safe. Respondents were also asked to  estimate the percentage of the following offenders who were arrested  and the percentage who were imprisoned: burglary offenders, sexual  assault offenders, illegal gun possessors, and violent gun crime  offenders. Respondents were asked if they had ever heard gunshots in  New Haven, and if so, when the gunshots were last heard, how many gunshots  were heard, and if they called the police when the gunshots were  heard. Finally, respondents were asked if they had heard of any  programs in New Haven designed to reduce gun crimes. If so, they were  asked if they knew the name of the program and which agencies or organizations were involved, and how they learned of the program."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community policing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fear of crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun control"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun regulation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"weapons offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
