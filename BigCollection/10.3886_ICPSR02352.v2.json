The  data collection provides both block- and individual-level neighborhood  data for two time periods, 1981-1982 and 1994. The block-level files  (Parts 1-6) include information about physical conditions, land use,  people counts, and crime rates. Parts 1-3, the block assessment files,  contain researchers' observations of street layout, traffic, housing  type, and general upkeep of the neighborhoods. Part 1, Block  Assessments, 1981 and 1994, contains the researchers' observations of  sampled blocks in 1981, plus selected variables from Part 3 that  correspond to items observed in 1981. Nonsampled blocks (in Part 2)  are areas where block assessments were done, but no interviews were  conducted. The \"people counts\" file (Part 4) is an actual count of  people seen by the researchers on the sampled blocks in 1994.  Variables for this file include the number, gender, and approximate  age of the people seen and the types of activities they were engaged  in during the assessment. Part 5, Land Use Inventory for Sampled  Blocks, 1994, is composed of variables describing the types of  buildings in the neighborhood and their physical condition. Part 6,  Crime Rates and Census Data for All Baltimore Neighborhoods,  1970-1992, includes crime rates from the Baltimore Police Department  for aggravated assault, burglary, homicide, larceny, auto theft, rape,  and robbery for 1970-1992, and census information from the 1970, 1980,  and 1990 United States Censuses on the composition of the housing  units and the age, gender, race, education, employment, and income of  residents. The individual-level files (Parts 7-9) contain data from  interviews with neighborhood leaders, as well as telephone surveys of  residents.

The  crime rate data consist of yearly Part I index crimes obtained from  the Baltimore Police Department for all of Baltimore's 277  ecologically-defined neighborhoods, as well as end-of-decade crime  rates and percentiles. Census block characteristics from the 1970,  1980, and 1990 United States Censuses are also presented. The block  environment assessments and land use inventories were conducted by  researchers who were given specific criteria to use in describing the  physical attributes of the homes and other buildings in the  neighborhoods. The people counts were performed by researchers driving  around the study blocks, counting the number of people they observed  and categorizing them by age, gender, and activity. To minimize the  subjectivity of such assessments, the block assessments, land use  inventories, and people counts were conducted by pairs of raters who  individually assessed the same blocks. Reliability measures and  average ratings were then calculated. The individual-level files  contain surveys of residents from 1982 and 1994, as well as interviews  with neighborhood leaders from 1994. The interviews for 1982 were  conducted by phone, unless the respondent could not be reached that  way, and all of the 1994 interviews were administered using CATI  (computer-aided telephone interviewing).
