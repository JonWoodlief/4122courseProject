The happiness data were obtained from the General Social Survey between 2009 and 2013, asking respondents to report overall happiness level by using scale ranging between 1 to 10 points. House Price Indexes at the provincial level were constructed to cover the same period. The relationship between average house price change and average happiness was estimated using Ordinary Least Square and Logistic Regression techniques. Individual's characteristics were used as control variables. The study found that average happiness level is positively and significantly related to the change in housing prices for one group and not for another - for homeowners but not for renters. In addition, individuals with better health are much happier than individuals with poor health. Similarly, individuals with higher income are happier than individuals with less income. The implication of this study is that the government should design attractive policies to encourage homeownerships."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-06-15"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"House prices"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"happiness"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"well-being"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"homeowners"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Javid, Ottoman"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-12-15"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Happiness and House Prices in Canada: 2009-2013","label":"Happiness and House Prices in Canada 2009-2013","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":96731,"dataFile":{"id":2964717,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VQQHCI/SMSUDZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VQQHCI/SMSUDZ","filename":"Happiness and House Prices in Canada 2009-2013","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":883335,"description":"Happiness and House Prices in Canada: 2009-2013","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1590221cee1-876b2aefe001","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5c18387add3ced61bfa4e0eccad423a2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5c18387add3ced61bfa4e0eccad423a2"}}}]}}}
