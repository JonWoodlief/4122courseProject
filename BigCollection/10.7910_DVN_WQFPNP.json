Version 2.1 of the MID data set covered the 1816-1992 period. The data collection project that culminated in version 3.0 gathered new data on all MIDs that began between 1993 and 2001, along with those MIDs that began before 1993 but were still ongoing on December 31, 1992.<br /><br />\r\n \r\n Version 3.02 (released on October 10, 2003) includes information about the specific incidents that occurred within each MID for the 1993-2001 period (along with the MIDs ongoing at the end of 1992). In addition, version 3.02 includes a dyadic version of the disputes that were newly collected for the v3.0 data set. In March 2004, we released summary information about many MIDs in the form of \"narratives\" about the MIDs that give a prose description of the actors, issues, and some critical actions occurring within each MID.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n \r\n Citation information:<br /><br />In any papers or publications that utilize this data set, users are asked to give the version number and cite the article of record for the data set, as follows:<br /><br />\r\n \r\n \r\n Main Bibliography Entry: Ghosn, Faten, Glenn Palmer, and Stuart Bremer. 2004. \"The MID3 Data Set, 1993–2001: Procedures, Coding Rules, and Description.\" Conflict Management and Peace Science 21:133-154.<br /><br />\r\n \r\n \r\n Dyadic Data Set Bibliography Entry: Ghosn, Faten, an\r\nd Scott Bennett. 2003.
