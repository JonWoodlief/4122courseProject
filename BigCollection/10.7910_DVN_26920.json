The emphasis would be on the possibility of rice varietal introduction as a planned adaptive strategy. It is guided by the following research questions:  1.\tIs drought a hazard farmers face in the study areas?  2.\tWhat are the possible impacts of drought in the selected study areas? 3.\tWhat factors determine household choice of adaptive and coping mechanisms during drought episodes? 4.\tHow is household vulnerability to drought impacts using the concept of Vulnerability to Expected Poverty (VEP) measured? 5.\tWhat household characteristics (or types) are most vulnerable to drought impacts? Special reference will be made to gender related issues or aspects. 6.\tDoes adaptive or coping mechanisms including social networks and the level of social capital, reduce the vulnerability of rice farming households?"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Household demographic information; Household economic status, consumption and income; Rice (input & output), non-rice, and livestock production; Gender division of labor; Awareness, perception, and coping mechanism on drought stress; Social capital; Household decision-making"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: Number of Repondents  Type: Sample Size  Notes: 197 (A total of 201 farmers were interviewed.
