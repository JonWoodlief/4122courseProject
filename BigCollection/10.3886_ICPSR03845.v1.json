Respondents were asked whether computers and technology,   companies keeping personal information on their customers, credit   agencies recording and disclosing credit information, and access to   public government records by third parties constituted invasions of   privacy. Respondents were polled on whether they worried about   government agencies or private companies like credit card companies   misusing their personal information or their personal information   being accessed by hackers or by persons monitoring their phone   conversations. In addition, respondents were asked whether they had   ever been a victim of information misuse, whether they were concerned   about the accuracy of public records about them, and whether there   should be laws governing third party access to personal information   without consumer consent, the inclusion of corrections and criticisms   of personal information, notification of the types of information   held by an organization about an individual, and access to one's   personal information for a minimal fee. Opinions were gathered on   President Clinton's handling of relations with North Korea, whether   the United Nations should have imposed a trade embargo on North   Korea, whether the United States and its allies should have taken   military action against North Korea, and whether dealings with North   Korea involved interests vital to the United States. Respondents were   also queried on whether sexual harassment in the workplace was a   problem in the United States, whether respondents themselves had ever   been harassed, and if they reported the harassment, the outcomes of   reporting the harassment, the reasons one may or may not report   sexual harassment, and whether the accuser or accused is more likely   to be believed in sexual harassment cases. Views were gathered on   whether it is easy or hard to legally file sexual harassment charges,   whether sexual harassment may be brought on by one's clothing and/or   behavior, whether President Clinton sexually harassed former Arkansas   state employee Paula Jones, and whether Supreme Court Justice   Clarence Thomas sexually harassed Anita Hill.
