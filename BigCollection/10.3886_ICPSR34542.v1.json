Community Care of North Carolina maintains this unique database on behalf of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, and facilitates requests for access to integrated behavioral health services data for research purposes. This expanded data set has great value to researchers in North Carolina and elsewhere.  The NCIDR warehouse is a unique resource for obtaining the most complete picture of the health services delivered to people with severe mental illness in North Carolina.  Few examples of such an integrated warehouse exist anywhere else, and NCIDR makes it possible for researchers and epidemiologists to conduct comparative effectiveness research related to people with these conditions.</p>\n\n<p>The merged data sources include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Medicaid claims and enrollment data for nearly 1 million individuals with MH, DD and SA diagnoses.</li>\n<li>IPRS (Integrated Payment and Reporting System) -- covers primarily outpatient mental health services for people that do not qualify for Medicaid (approximately 250,000 individuals).</li>\n<li>HEARTS (Healthcare Enterprise Accounts Receivable Tracking System) -- documents services delivered by inpatient State Mental Health facilities (approximately 25,000 individuals).</li>\n<li>Piedmont Behavioral Health (Medicaid waiver) -- behavioral health encounter data from Medicaid's capitated arrangement in five counties (approximately 25,000 individuals).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Data are available for four state fiscal years, 2008 through 2011 (7/1/2007--6/30/2011).  Each year has three data sets (claims, client, provider) in addition to multiple lookup tables with definitions. Population includes any Medicaid client with a claim that contains any MH, DD or SA (290xx through 319xx) diagnosis at least once in the four year time period, plus all clients appearing in the other 3 data sources.  Requests will need to specify required time periods and clearly define the population being studied. Note that individuals dually enrolled with Medicare during months in which they are dually enrolled are excluded.</p>\n\n<p>The data available for future use will include a claims file, a client file, a provider file and multiple lookup files.  The claims file contains approximately 83 columns including 30 columns for diagnosis codes.  The client file is approximately 78 columns which displays 12 columns each (one for each month in the SFY) for eligibility, enrollment, assigned network, primary care physician and dual status indicator.  There are 5 columns in the Provider file.  The lookup file will contain tables for every code that requires a description.  The da\nta will be parsed into individual state fiscal years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Access</strong></p>\n\n<p>These data are not available from ICPSR.
