This particular survey was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of Tanzania. Respondents were asked to rate Tanzanian President Mkapa and his administration's overall performance, to compare the democratic form of government to the former form of government, and to state what they considered to be the most important issue facing the nation. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in endeavors such as improving the economy, reducing crime, education, making sure all Tanzanians have food, alleviating poverty, and reducing the spread of AIDS. Questions addressed whether corruption existed in various local and national government and social institutions, how well the current government had fulfilled its promises, the government's handling of crime, health care, education, poverty, and housing, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, whether the current government was too complicated to be understood by the general population, and whether the government, political parties, the police, the military, churches, and other social, political, and economic institutions could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, the inclusiveness of the government, and what reactions would be to government-imposed restrictions on their social lives, ideas, the media, the judicial system, and Parliament. Opinions were gathered on whether men and women should have equal rights, whether the president should be able to easily change the Constitution, the acceptability of violence in politics, how often Tanzanians broke the law, and the Structural Assessment Program (SAP). In addition, sets of questions addressed the 2000 October elections, whether government laws and policies hindered economic growth, whether government policies benefited one group more than other groups, and whether respondents were satisfied with the performance of the National Assembly, also known as Parliament, in general, and specifically, the respondent's elected Parliament member. Societal questions addressed how much trust could be placed in others, whether it was wise to plan ahead, whether everyone should be responsible for themselves and their own successes or failures, whether members of a family should always share the sam\ne political beliefs, the sources respondents used for news and information, whether it was dangerous to allow too many differing views and opinions, what, if any, volunteer organizations respondents participated in, and whether it was easy to obtain assistance in securing food, water, schooling, and medical services. Economic questions focused on whether large income disparities were fair, whether encouraging people to start small businesses would create more jobs, whether allowing foreign investment in Tanzania was a good idea, how respondents' economic situations compared to those of other Tanzanians, and whether land should be owned by the individual or by the community. Background information includes sex, age, home language, religious orientation, education level, occupation, whether a close friend or relative had died from AIDS, the language used in interview, political orientation, whether the respondent had a bank account, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AIDS"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"democracy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"markets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national interests"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political systems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public confidence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"standard of living"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trust in government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.2.
