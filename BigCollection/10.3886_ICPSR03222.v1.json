Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President  Bill Clinton and his handling of foreign policy and the current  situation in the Middle East, as well as their views on Vice President  and Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, Connecticut senator and  Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman, Texas  governor and Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, and  former Secretary of Defense and Republican vice-presidential candidate  Dick Cheney. Those polled expressed their interest in and opinions  about the 2000 presidential election, their readiness to vote in the  upcoming election, and their level of support for both candidates,  Gore and Bush. Respondents were also asked whether on the day of the  survey they would vote for Gore or Bush. They then answered the same  question, choosing among four candidates: Gore (Democratic Party  candidate), Bush (Republican Party candidate), Pat Buchanan (Reform  Party candidate), and Ralph Nader (Green Party candidate). A series of  questions addressed the presidential campaign, including whether  respondents viewed the campaign as interesting or dull, and how they  assessed the candidates with respect to political philosophy, job  preparedness, ability to negotiate with Congress, ability to negotiate  effectively with world leaders, leadership qualities, integrity,  whether they cared about the American people, whether they spent their  campaign explaining their position or attacking their opponent,  ability to deal with an international crisis, and the candidates'  motives. Respondents' views were sought regarding the dispute between  Israel and the Palestinians, including which side respondents  sympathized with, whether Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the  government of Israel and/or Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat and the  Palestinians had been keeping or breaking agreements made in the peace  process, whether Bush had the experience necessary to negotiate a  peace settlement, whether either candidate would become personally  involved in foreign problems similar to this or delegate to his  advisors, and whether the United States could do anything to establish  peace in the Middle East. Additional topics included respondent  impressions of the third presidential debate held on Tuesday, October  17, 2000, and their opinions on whether a candidate's position on  issues or their personal qualities were more important, the influence  of campaign promises to improve education, the use of school vouchers,  and whether the New York Yankees or the New York Mets would win the  World Series. Background information on respondents includes age,  gender, political party, political philosophy, voter registration and  participation history, education, marital status, religion, race,  Hispanic descent, years in community, child\nren in household, household income, and computer and Internet access."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Arab Israeli
