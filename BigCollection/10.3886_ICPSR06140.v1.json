To address issues of psychological consequences, the events  occurring prior to child loss, during the experience of child loss,  and after child recovery (if applicable) were studied from multiple  perspectives within the family by interviewing parents, spouses,  siblings, and, when possible, the missing child. A sample of 249  families with one or more missing children were followed with in-home  interviews, in a time series measurement design. Three time periods  were used: Time Series 1, within 45 days of disappearance, Time Series  2, at 4 months post-disappearance, and Time Series 3, at 8 months  post-disappearance. Three groups of missing children and their  families were studied: loss from alleged nonfamily abduction  (stranger), loss by alleged family or parental abduction, and loss by  alleged runaway. Cases were selected from four confidential sites in  the United States. The files in this collection consist of data from  detailed structured interviews (Parts 1-22) and selected quantitative  nationally-normed measurement instruments (Parts 23-33). Structured  interview items covered: (1) family of origin for parents of the  missing child or children, (2) demographics of the current family with  the missing child or children, (3) conditions in the family before the  child's disappearance, (4) circumstances of the child's disappearance,  (5) perception of the child's disappearance, (6) missing child search,  (7) nonmissing child, concurrent family stress, (8) coping with the  child's disappearance, (9) coping with a nonmissing child, concurrent  family stress, (10) missing child recovery, if applicable, (11)  recovered child reunification with family, if applicable, and (12)  resource and assistance evaluation. With respect to intervention  services, utilization of and satisfaction with these services were  assessed in each of the following categories: law enforcement  services, mental health services, missing ch\nild center services,  within-family social support, and community social support. The  quantitative instruments collected data on family members' stress  levels and reactions to stress, using the Symptom Check List-90,  Achenbach Child Behavior Check List, Family Inventory of Life Events,  F-COPES, Frederick Trauma Reaction Index-Adult, and Frederick Trauma Reaction Index-Child."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was conducted to examine the  psychological reactions experienced by families of missing children  and to evaluate families' utilization of and satisfaction with  intervention services, including law enforcement services, mental  health services, missing child center services, within-family social  support, and community social support.

The project  design provided for the measurement of multiple perspectives within  each family. One parent figure, at the request of the project staff  interviewer, was self-designated as the Primary Respondent. If the  Primary Respondent had a married or other live-in relationship with  another adult, this individual was designated as the Partner. The  oldest sibling in the home over the age of 8 and under the age of 18  was designated as the representative Sibling for the project. The  Missing Child, if recovered and over the age of 8, was a project  participant as well. The project incorporated a repeated measures,  time series, multiple perspective design utilizing quantitative and  project-specific measurement instrumentation administered in  person. The project assessment package was divided into two major  sections, structured interviews and quantitative instruments. Family  contact and case selection were accomplished through four confidential  field sites in the United States. Each site had a full-time family  interviewer located there. By the conclusion of the project,  each remaining family case had completed three time series interviews  (Time Series 1, within 45 days of disappearance, Time Series 2, at 4  months post-disappearance, and Time Series 3, at 8 months  post-disappearance).
