Mitochondria in muscle are found in well-defined regions within cells, and they are arranged in a way that form distinct subpopulations of subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF) mitochondria. We sought to investigate differences in the proteomes of SS and IMF mitochondria between lean subjects and subjects with obesity. We performed comparative proteomic analyses on SS and IMF mitochondria isolated from muscle samples obtained from lean subjects and subjects with obesity. Mitochondria were isolated using differential centrifugation, and proteins were subjected to label-free quantitative tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Collected data were evaluated for abundance of mitochondrial proteins using spectral counting. The Reactome pathway database was used to determine metabolic pathways that are altered in obesity. Among proteins, 73 and 41 proteins showed different (mostly lower) expression in subjects with obesity in the SS and IMF mitochondria, respectively (false discovery rate-adjusted P â‰¤ 0.05). We specifically found an increase in proteins forming the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) complex II, but a decrease in proteins forming protein complexes I and III of the ETC and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase in subjects with obesity in the IMF, but not SS, mitochondria. Obesity was associated with differential effects on metabolic pathways linked to protein translation in the SS mitochondria and ATP formation in the IMF mitochondria.
