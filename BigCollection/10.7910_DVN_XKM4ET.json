From cloud service providersâ€™ perspective, profit is one of the\r\nmost important considerations, and it is mainly determined by the configuration of a cloud service platform\r\nunder given market demand. However, a single long-term renting scheme is usually adopted to configure a\r\ncloud platform, which cannot guarantee the service quality but leads to serious resource waste. In this paper, a\r\ndouble resource renting scheme is designed firstly in which short-term renting and long-term renting are\r\ncombined aiming at the existing issues. This double renting scheme can effectively guarantee the quality of\r\nservice of all requests and reduce the resource waste greatly. Secondly, a service system is considered as an\r\nM/M/m+D queuing model and the performance indicators that affect the profit of our double renting scheme\r\nare analyzed, e.g., the average charge, the ratio of requests that need temporary servers, and so forth. Thirdly, a\r\nprofit maximization problem is formulated for the double renting scheme and the optimized configuration of a\r\ncloud platform is obtained by solving the profit maximization problem. Finally, a series of calculations are\r\nconducted to compare the profit of our proposed scheme with that of the single renting scheme. The results show\r\nthat our scheme can not only guarantee the service quality of all requests, but also obtain more profit than the\r\nlatter."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IJRISE, IJRISE Journal"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-10-15"}]}},"files":[{"label":"16October3.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88151,"dataFile":{"id":2903542,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/XKM4ET/LQLTPB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XKM4ET/LQLTPB","filename":"16October3.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1041564,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:157cb91d4d2-6901af3c2a39","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"96b1023a193c5ea305518a7ef09556fb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"96b1023a193c5ea305518a7ef09556fb"}}}]}}}
