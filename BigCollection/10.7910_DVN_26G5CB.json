SFH undertook a project MAP study in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, which are the three main intervention areas of SFHs condom social marketing program. The main goal of this study was to ascertain the coverage, quality of coverage, and access for Trust and Lovers Plus condoms among the general population and among the population residing in selected high transmission areas.  The primary sampling unit for the study is sub places (SPs). Only SPs that are classified as urban or suburban were studied. Lot quality assurance sampling was employed, which allows for reasonably accurate estimates of coverage and quality of coverage for an entire supervision area. In each city, a representative samples of high transmission areas (HTAs) and non-high transmission areas (non-HTAs) were randomly selected. Maps for HTAs were acquired from researchers in the South African government. However, where a list of high transmission SPs was not available, an appropriate number of priority HTAs were purposively selected in the same way as hot zones are selected. Within the selected SPs all outlets present were targeted and an audit sheet was administered to collect data. The collected data was entered into an Excel spreadsheet before being processed in SPSS and Microsoft Access."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MAP"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LQAS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Quantitative"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Condoms"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Providers"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV/AIDS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DUTCH"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"South Africa (2006): MAP Study Evaluating Coverage and Quality of Coverage of Lovers Plus and Trust Condoms in Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg First Round"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI/South Africa (SFH)"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://psi.org/resources/research"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-11-04"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"South Africa"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"603-South_Africa_Condoms_MAP_SMRS.doc","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54700,"categories":["report on web"],"dataFile":{"id":2322647,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"603-South_Africa_Condoms_MAP_SMRS.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":1435648,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:75652","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e78c75e4b5a4846c4bb329ea8b8c0ff0","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e78c75e4b5a4846c4bb329ea8b8c0ff0"}}},{"description":"","label":"603-South_Africa_Condoms_MAP_SMRS.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54700,"categories":["report on web"],"dataFile":{"id":2322645,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"603-South_Africa_Condoms_MAP_SMRS.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1197069,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:75650","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"22b9a3458d94a10ca2ae290e5c1cfe24","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"22b9a3458d94a10ca2ae290e5c1cfe24"}}},{"description":"","label":"za.06.map.CDM.zip","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54700,"categories":["zip uploaded"],"dataFile":{"id":2322646,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"za.06.map.CDM.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":1932121,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:75651","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3dd0f15f141ab8cc331d6f34ae02b279","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3dd0f15f141ab8cc331d6f34ae02b279"}}}]}}}
