Baseline interviews were conducted with  participants upon entering a drug rehabilitation program in New  Jersey. Under the terms of this program, which was an alternative to  prison, any incident of drug use occurring during the rehabilitation  period would result in the participant's returning to  prison. Follow-up interviews were conducted when the participant  either had a drug/alcohol use relapse or successfully completed a year  in the program without a drug-use incident. Baseline interviews  included questions about criminal and drug-use history, as well as  initial reactions to the drug rehabilitation program. Follow-up  interviews probed for participants' feelings about the drug  rehabilitation program experience. Further questions concerned  participants' failure or success at staying away from drugs or alcohol."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Institute for Criminological Research  conducted this study with the aim of gauging the degree to which  subjective deterrence and rational choice affect drug-use  recidivism. A secondary goal was to explore the effect of other social  and psychological factors (e.g., those related to drug rehabilitation  counseling) upon drug-use recidivism. The Intensive Supervision  Program (ISP) in New Jersey was chosen because participants were aware  that new drug-use incidents would most likely result in a return to  prison. The main hypotheses of this study maintained that drug use in  ISP was an inverse function of both the degree to which participants  preferred ISP to prison and of the participants' belief that drug use would result in a return to prison."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Intensive Supervision Program (ISP) was chosen  for this study because participants in ISP were generally aware that  new drug-use incidents would result in punishment, possibly including  a return to prison.

Interviews were conducted a few weeks after the  individual's arrival in the program. The aim was to interview  participants once they had begun to settle into the program, but  before any drug-use recidivism had occurred.
