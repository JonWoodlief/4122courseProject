Respondents were asked about Bill Clinton's handling of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy. They were also asked about Clinton's economic plan and about his political orientation, leadership qualities, ability to deal with an international crisis, and concern for the needs and problems of people. Additional questions concerned the fairness of a gasoline tax to reduce the federal budget deficit, and whether the government works better when the president and the majority of Congress both belong to the same political party. Concerning Japan, respondents were asked to identify the country that would becom\ne the United States' most important economic and diplomatic partner in the next century, to describe present and future relations between Japan and the United States, to indicate their feelings toward Japan, to consider whether Japan would be the number one economic power in the world in the next century, and to describe the current condition of the Japanese economy. Respondents were asked whether Japanese companies were competing unfairly with American companies, whether the United States, Japan, or Germany made products and cars of higher quality, whether Japan was more advanced in high technology, and whether Japan would achieve a higher level of technology in manufacturing than the United States in the next century. Further questions concerning Japan dealt with trade, protectionism, the dispute with Russia over four islands captured by Russia during World War II, participation in international peace-keeping operations, and the provision of military and financial assistance in response to requests by allies. Additional topics included the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Bosnia, Somalia, and immigration. The call-back portion of the survey focused on opinion regarding the American attack on the headquarters of the Iraqi Intelligence Agency in Baghdad in response to evidence of an Iraqi plot to assassinate then-President George Bush. Background information on respondents includes voter registration status, household composition, 1992 presidential vote, amount of attention paid to news about Japan and Russia, nationality of company that made respondent's car, political party, political orientation, marital status, religious preference, education, age, race, Hispanic origin, family income, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
