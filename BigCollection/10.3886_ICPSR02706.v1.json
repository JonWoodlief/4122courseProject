First, the researchers examined differences in the  accuracy of self-reported drug use across five factors: gender, race,  age, type of drug, and offense seriousness. Second, an attempt was  made to determine the specific sources of inaccurate self-reports in  terms of differences in underreporting and overreporting. Third, the  researchers sought to explain differences in underreporting and  overreporting in terms of true differences or differences in  opportunity to underreport or overreport.

The DUF drug testing and measurement methodology  allows the accuracy of self-reported drug use to be checked with a  biological criterion, namely urine tests. The sample for this study  consisted of 4,752 white and Black adults from Indianapolis,  Ft. Lauderdale, Phoenix, and Dallas. The five exogenous measures  included in this study were type of drug (marijuana vs.  crack/cocaine), age (18 through 30 vs. 31 or over), offense  seriousness (misdemeanor vs. felony), race (Black vs. white), and  gender (male vs. female). The endogenous measures were accuracy  (self-report and drug test both positive or both negative  vs. otherwise), underreporting (self-report negative but drug test  positive vs. otherwise), and overreporting (self-report positive but  drug test negative vs. otherwise).

A well-known problem with  self-reports is the uncertainty about their ability to accurately  indicate what is being measured, especially when the topic is as  sensitive as drug use. In particular, the extent to which  self-reported drug use is a valid indicator of actual drug use across  social groups has been repeatedly questioned. While patterns across  previous studies suggest that validity differences in self-reported  drug use do exist, these differences could not be statistically  evaluated because of the diversity in the types of high-risk  populations studied, the types of drug use measured, and the  measurement procedures and conditions of each study. This study  investigated the accuracy of self-reported drug use in three  ways. First, the researchers examined differences in the accuracy of  self-reported drug\nuse across five factors: gender, race, age, type of  drug, and offense seriousness. Second, an attempt was made to  determine the specific sources of inaccurate self-reports in terms of  differences in underreporting and overreporting. Third, the  researchers sought to explain differences in underreporting and  overreporting in terms of true differences or differences in  opportunity. Only individuals who tested positive had the opportunity  to underreport drug use. Similarly, only individuals who tested negative had the opportunity to overreport drug use."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study used data collected in 1994 as part of  the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) Program [DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24  CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997 (ICPSR 9477)].
