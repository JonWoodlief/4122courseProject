The software supports multi-spectral line-polarization MSE diagnostics which simultaneously measure emission at the MSE sigma and pi lines as well as at two `background' wavelengths that are displaced\r\nfrom the MSE spectrum by a few nanometers. This analysis accurately estimates the amplitude of partially-polarized background light at the sigma and pi wavelengths even in situations where the background light changes\r\nrapidly in time and space. The signal amplitude at many frequencies is computed using a numerical-beat algorithm which allows the retardance of the MSE photo-elastic modulators (PEMs) to be monitored during routine operation. It also allows the use of summed intensities at multiple frequencies in the calculation of polarization direction, which increases the effective signal strength and reduces sensitivity to PEM retardance\r\ndrift. The software allows the polarization angles to be corrected for calibration drift using a system that illuminates the MSE diagnostic with polarized light at four known polarization angles within ten seconds of a plasma discharge The software suite is modular, parallelized, and portable to other facilities."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-06-06"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Report number: PSFC/JA-16-14."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Thomas, Jason"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-06-06"}]}},"files":[]}}}
