Investigators also examined the relationships  among gangs, cocaine trafficking, and increasing levels of violence.  They attempted to determine the effects of increased gang involvement  in cocaine distribution in terms of the location of an incident, the  demographic profiles of suspects, and the level of firearm use. They  also looked at issues such as whether the connection between gangs and  cocaine trafficking yielded more drug-related violence, how the  connection between gangs and cocaine trafficking affected police  investigative processes such as intra-organizational communication and  the use of special enforcement technologies, what kinds of working  relationships were established between narcotics units and gang  control units, and what the characteristics were of the rock  trafficking and rock house technologies of the dealers. Part 1 (Sales  Arrest Incident Data File) contains data for the cocaine sales arrest  incidents. Part 2 (Single Incident Participant Data File) contains  data for participants of the cocaine sales arrest incidents. Part 3  (Single Incident Participant Prior Arrest Data File) contains data for  the prior arrests of the participants in the cocaine arrest  incidents.

Part 5 (Multiple Event Arrest Incident  Data File) contains data for arrest events in the multiple event  incidents.
