The main  focus was to conduct a pilot study to test an instrument the  researchers had designed for profiling the needs of youthful female  offenders in developing a protocol for use by other jurisdictions and  agencies working with delinquent female youths. To study the needs and  program demands of young female offenders, the researchers conducted a  profile survey of 162 randomly-selected women at the Ventura School in  the California Youth Authority (CYA) in the summer of 1996. The data  are the result of personal interviews using a modified version of the  instrument used for a 1995 study of adult female offenders in the  California Department of Corrections by the principal  investigators. Information was collected on demographics, social and  economic background, criminal history, and correctional  experiences. Demographic variables include age, race and ethnicity,  marital status, and parents' marital status. Variables on social and  economic background include religious preference, living situation,  education, work history, family relationships, pregnancy history while  incarcerated, and family and juvenile history. Criminal history  variables cover gang involvement, arrest and sentence information,  offense profile, reasons for committing the offense, weapon use,  substance abuse history, and personal abuse. Variables on correctional  experiences include abuse counseling, HIV testing, correctional  programming participation, work experience during incarceration, and California Youth Authority housing assignment."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"While young female offenders remain a small  minority within the juvenile justice system, the unique needs and  program demands of this population require particular attention in  terms of research and policy. Some research findings suggest  delinquent females tend to be similar to male delinquents in terms of  lower socioeconomic status, disrupted family backgrounds, and school  difficulties. Most researchers argue, however, that girls' lives and  girls' problems present unique challenges for the juvenile justice  system and related social service agencies. These gender-based  differences shape both offense patterning and policy response. This  study was designed to assess the female juvenile offender population  in terms of its characteristics and existing program structure. The  main focus was to conduct a pilot study to test an instrument the  researchers had designed for profiling the needs of youthful female  offenders in developing a protocol for use by other jurisdictions and  agencies working with delinquent females.
