It was also designed to describe the continuum from functionally independent living in the community through dependence, possible institutionalization, and finally death. The LSOA is an extension of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of 1984, following its sample of 16,148 noninstitutionalized elderly people (55 years and over) living in the United States, with a special focus on those who were 70 years and over in 1984. This release of the LSOA contains data on those respondents who had been 70 years and older at the time of their 1984 interviews. The data include 1986, 1988, and 1990 reinterviews, National Death Index matches from 1984-1989, and 1987 interviews with contact persons named by decedents, as well as selected variables from the\n1984 NHIS core questionnaire and its two supplements, Health Insurance and the Supplement on Aging (SOA). Two Medicare files are also included: Part 2, Medicare Hospital Records, and Part 3, Other Medicare Use Records (which covers home health care, hospice, and outpatient use).
