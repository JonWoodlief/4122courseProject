The focus of this data collection was on the upcoming March 7, 2000, presidential primary in New York State. Residents of New York State were asked about the way Governor George Pataki was handling his job and the single most important issue for the federal government to address in the coming year. Those who were registered to vote were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Texas Governor George W. Bush, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, and Arizona Senator John McCain. Respondents were asked whether they were paying attention to the presidential campaign, the likelihood that they would vote in the upcoming presidential primary and for which party, which candidate they were leaning toward, and why. Registered Republicans were asked whether Governor Pataki's support of George W. Bush would affect their vote in the Republican primary and which Republican candidate was more likely to defeat the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. A series of questions queried respondents on whether participation in party primaries should be restricted to registered members of the party, what motives Democrats and Independents might have in voting in the New York State Republican primary, and on George W. Bush's recent speech at Bob Jones University. In addition, all respondents in the poll were asked about the recent outcome of the Amadou Diallo shooting case. Demographic information includes age, sex, race, education level, marital status, household income, religious preference, political party affiliation, political philosophy, and voter registration and participation
