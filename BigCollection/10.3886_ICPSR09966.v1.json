The Minneapolis study found arrest to be an effective deterrent  against repeat domestic violence. The two key purposes of the current  study were (1) to examine the possible differences in reactions to  arrest, and (2) to compare the effects of short and long incarceration  associated with arrest. Research protocol involved 35 patrol officers  in four Milwaukee police districts screening domestic violence cases  for eligibility, then calling police headquarters to request a  randomly-assigned disposition. The three possible randomly assigned  dispositions were (1) Code 1, which consisted of arrest and at least  one night in jail, unless the suspect posted bond, (2) Code 2, which  consisted of arrest and immediate release on recognizance from the  booking area at police headquarters, or as soon as possible, and (3)  Code 3, which consisted of a standard Miranda-style script warning  read by police to both suspect and victim. A battered women's shelter  hotline system provided the primary measurement of the frequency of  violence by the same suspects both before and after each case leading  to a randomized police action. Other forms of measurement included  arrests of the suspect both before and after the offense, as well as  offenses against the same victim. Initial victim interviews were  attempted within one month after the first 900 incidents were  compiled. A second victim interview was attempted six months after the  incident for all 1,200 cases. Data collected for this study included  detailed data on each of the 1,200 randomized events, less detailed  data on an additional 854 cases found ineligible, \"pipeline\" data on  the frequency of domestic violence in the four Milwaukee police  districts, official measures of prior and subsequent domestic violence  for both suspects and victims, interviews of arrested suspects for  eligible and ineligible cases, criminal justice system dispositions of  the randomized arrests, results of urinalysis tests of drug and  alcohol use for some arrestees, and log attempts to obtain interviews  from suspects and victims. Demographic variables include victim and  suspect age, race, education, employment status, and marital status.  Additional information obtained includes victim-offender  relationships, alcohol and drug use during incident, substance of  conflict, nature of victim injury and medical treatment as reported by  police and v\nictims, characteristics of suspects in the Code 1 and 2  arrest groups, victim and suspect reports of who called police, and victim and suspect versions of speed of police response."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This data collection is patterned after the  Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment (SPECIFIC DETERRENT EFFECTS  OF ARREST FOR DOMESTIC ASSAULT: MINNEAPOLIS, 1981-1982 [ICPSR 8250]),  a study testing police responses to domestic violence. That study  found that arrest was the most effective of three standard methods  police use to reduce domestic violence. The other police  methods--attempting to counsel both parties or sending assailants away  from home for several hours--were found to be considerably less  effective in deterring future domestic violence in the cases  examined. The current study represents a modified replication in  Milwaukee of the original Minneapolis experiment, with four times as  many cases, fewer deviations from random assignment, a majority of  Black victims and offenders, and measures of before-and-after  differences in offending frequency. The main objectives of the study  were (1) to replicate the Minneapolis experiment in a city with higher  rates and seriousness of violence, particularly one with a greater  ethnic and economic mix, (2) to test the impact of arrest with brief  versus overnight jail time, and (3) to measure interaction effects by  obtaining a larger sample size. The study focused on repeat domestic  violence by the suspect against any victim, the total frequency of  repeat violence associated with each of the police actions, and the total count of all violent incidents during the follow-up period."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Experimental procedures involved 35 patrol  officers in four of Milwaukee, Wisconsin's six police districts  screening all misdemeanor domestic battery cases for eligibility, then  calling the Crime Control Institute office at police headquarters to  request a randomly-assigned disposition. The eligibility requirements  included probable cause that a misdemeanor battery had taken place  between two adult cohabitants or former cohabitants or parents of the  same child, where a single suspect was present and none of the  following conditions were found: (a) a valid restraining order in  effect, (b) an outstanding warrant for the suspect's arrest, (c)  serious bodily injury or threat of more violence, and (d) suspect's  assault on a police officer. The method of random assignment was to  pre-number the dispositions as Codes 1, 2, or 3, and arrange the  sequence of those three dispositions in a computer- generated order in  sealed envelopes with the sequence numbers marked on the outside.  Crime Control Institute staff opened the envelopes when police called,  telling police the correct disposition and recording the case in the  caselog. Code 1 consisted of arrest and at least one night in jail,  unless the suspect posted $250 bond. Code 2 involved arrest and  immediate release on recognizance from the booking area at police  headquarters, preferably within two hours, or as soon as  possible. Code 3 consisted of a standard Miranda-style script warning  read by police to both suspect and victim, telling them that no arrest  would be made unless police had to return to the home that  evening. The primary measurement of recidivism was calls recorded by a  Milwaukee battered women's shelter hotline system. Additional measures  of prior offending and recidivism were obtained from the Milwaukee  Police Department's file on individual arrest histories and victim  interviews. Initial victim interviews were attempted within one month  after the first 900 incidents were compiled. At some point six months  after the randomized incident, follow-up interviews were attempted for  all 1,200 cases. Interviews with arrested eligible suspects (Codes 1  and 2) and ineligible suspects were conducted in the police  department's lockup cells prior to boo\nking. To explore the connection  between domestic violence and alcohol or drug abuse, urine sampling  was undertaken for the last 300 eligible and ineligible domestic violence arrestees."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Victim interviews collected information regarding  the nature of the domestic assault incident such as reason for the  argument, extent of violence, threats, and property damage, and  incidents of domestic assault subsequent to the presenting incident.
