The data were   prepared for the Data Confrontation Seminar on the Use of Ecological   Data in Comparative Cross-National Research held under the auspices   of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social   Research on April 1-18, 1969. One of the primary concerns of   this international seminar was the need for cooperation in the   development of data resources in order to facilitate exchange of   data among individual scholars and research groups. Election  returns for two or more national and/or local elections are   provided for each of the nine nations, as well as ecological   materials for at least two time points in the general period of   the 1950s and 1960s.
