The election studies are  designed to pr\nesent data on Americans' social backgrounds, enduring  political predispositions, social and political values, perceptions  and evaluations of groups and candidates, opinions on questions of  public policy, and participation in political life. The 2000 National  Election Study (NES) entailed both a pre-election interview and a  post-election reinterview. A freshly drawn cross-section of the  electorate was taken to yield 1,807 cases. Because the study includes  a carefully designed mode experiment, the data represent two  presidential studies in 2000, side by side. The core study preserves  the past commitment to probability area sampling and face-to-face  interviewing: 1,000 respondents were interviewed prior to the election  and 694 were reinterviewed face-to-face after the election. Supporting  the core study, random-digit dial sampling and telephone interviewing  were used: 803 respondents were interviewed by phone prior to the  election and 862 respondents were interviewed by phone after the  election. As such, the experiment examines the differences between the  two modes and provides a preview of what shifting to telephone  interviewing will mean for the NES time-series. The content of the  2000 election study reflects its dual purpose as a traditional  presidential election year time-series data collection and as a mode  study. Many of the substantive themes included in the 2000  questionnaires are a continuation of past topics. Interest in politics  and the election was examined through questions regarding interest in  the political campaigns, concern about the outcome, attentiveness to  the media's coverage of the campaign, and information about  politics. Respondents' knowledge of candidates and the political  parties was ascertained through questions evaluating the presidential  candidates and placement of presidential candidates on various issue  dimensions, knowledge of the religious background of the major  presidential and vice-presidential candidates, partisanship and  evaluations of the political parties, and knowledge of and evaluation  of United States House of Representatives and United States Senate  candidates. Respondents were also asked about their political  participation in the November general election and in other forms of  electoral campaign activity, their choice for president, their choice  for the United States House of Representatives, and the United States  Senate, as well as their second choice for president. Respondents were  also queried about President Clinton's legacy and their knowledge  of former president George Bush Sr. and his administration. Additional  items focused on respondents' perceptions of personal and national  economic well-being, their positions on social welfare issues  (including government health insurance, federal budget priorities, and  the role of government in the provision of jobs and a good standard of  living), campaign finance and preference for divided government,  social issues (including gun control, abortion, women's roles, the  rights of homosexuals, the death penalty, school vouchers,  environmental policy), racial and ethnic stereotypes, affirmative  action, attitudes toward immigrants, and views on the nation's most  important problem. Respondents' values and political predispositions  (including moral traditionalism, political efficacy, egalitarianism,  humanitarianism, individualism, and trust in government), views on  fairness in elections, satisfaction with democracy, and the value of  voting were also assessed. Other questions addressed social altruism,  social connectedness, feeling thermometers on a wide range of  political figures and political groups, affinity with various social  groups, and detailed demographic information and measures of religious  affiliation and religiosity. Several new concepts were also addressed  in the 2000 study and include measures of social trust derived from  perceptions of the trustworthiness of neighbors and cow\norkers. Voter  turnout was also investigated with expanded response categories to  help respondents be more accurate in determining whether they did in  fact vote in November 2000. The concept of political knowledge was  also addressed with new instructions encouraging respondents to take  their best guess when answering the political knowledge questions.  The 2000 study also incorporated a social network battery, based  entirely on the perceptions of survey respondents regarding the  characteristics of their identified discussants. Two brief but  reliable measures of cognitive style, the need for cognition and the  need to evaluate, were also included in this study. Another important  feature of the 2000 NES is the mode experiment, which supplies the  ability to compare interviews taken in person with interviews taken  over the phone. This carefully designed mode experiment, driven by  theoretical and practical interest, allows scholars to test the  consequences of survey mode on data quality and reliability. The 2000  study incorporates numerous experiments that examine the effects of  mode: 7-point scales and branching, response order, \"don't know\"  filters, and social desirability. Demographic variables include  gender, race, employment status, and length of residency in the community."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton
