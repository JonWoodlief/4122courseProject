Subjects drawn from a national representative sample, oversampling for African-Americans, were asked through web-based interviews who they thought was responsible for the disaster. The study looked at 3 major groups of variables; demographics, attribution of responsibility, and knowledge.  The three groups eligible for attribution of responsibility were the Federal Government, local authorities in New Orleans, and New Orleans residents . Knowledge variables were gathered by asking respondents questions related to personal knowledge of Hurricane Katrina and the surrounding events. The study found that images affect attribution of blame, possibly acting an episodic framing mechanisms to reduce accountability."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hurricanes"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"natural disaster"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preparedness"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preparedness"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ben-Porath, E.

There were four experimental conditions and one control condition. In all conditions, subjects read the same news story about Katrina (which was devoid of any discussion of responsibility). In one condition the story included an image of a black male victim, while in second, a comparable white male victim. In a third image, respondents were shown a group of blacks walking on the highway, while in the fourth, respondents were shown a group of whites in the same setting.

The first is half-sampling of telephone numbers for which no address could be found. The second is RDD sampling rates proportional to the number of phone lines in the household. The third is minor oversampling of Chicago and Los Angeles due to early pilot surveys in these two cities. The fourth is short-term double-sampling of the four largest states (CA, NY, FL, and TX) and central region states. The fifth is under-sampling of households not covered by MSN TV. The sixth is oversampling of minority households (Black and Hispanic). Finally, the seventh weight is the selection of one adult per household. In order to calculate final weights, the researchers derived weighted sample distributions along various combinations of five variables. The first is gender (male, female). The second is age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 and over). The third is race/ethnicity (White, Black, other, Hispanic). The fourth is region (northeast, Midwest, south, west). Finally, the fifth variable is education (highest level achieved: less than high school, high school, some college, college degree or more). Similar distributions are calculated using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data and the KN panel data. Cell-by-cell adjustments over the various univariate and bivariate distributions are calculated to make the weighted sample cells match those of the U.S. Census and the KN panel."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The response rate for the survey was 65.2% (504 out of 773)."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"20100114 Questionnaire.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43280,"dataFile":{"id":2300816,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"20100114 Questionnaire.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":71693,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69617","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d991f845a7a8b42d81aab71c75bba26a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d991f845a7a8b42d81aab71c75bba26a"}}},{"description":"","label":"20110719 Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43280,"dataFile":{"id":2300815,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"20110719 Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":292832,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69618","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d5e6291d845d4845d62379aaed4340bb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d5e6291d845d4845d62379aaed4340bb"}}},{"description":"","label":"20110719 Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43280,"dataFile":{"id":2300817,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"20110719 Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":181108,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69619","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:AgF5ytzoLSlwmdgJ7wmtYQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7e77c27bb29dc82b7fdb8e7b727a6eb7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7e77c27bb29dc82b7fdb8e7b727a6eb7"}}}]}}}
