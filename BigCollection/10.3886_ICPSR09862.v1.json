Respondents were asked whether they   approved of George Bush's handling of the presidency, foreign policy,   and the economy. Relative to health care, respondents were asked   whether health insurance should be required to be provided by employers   or should be funded by tax money, whether a national health insurance   plan costing an ad\nditional $1,000 a year in taxes would be an   improvement, whether a national health care system should set rules   about which patients could receive certain procedures, whether the cost   of a national health care system should be split between employers and   the government, and whether tax credits should be given for health   insurance. Questions about the current health care system queried   respondents on how satisfied they were with the current system, what   single most important change in the system they would like to see,   whether the United States was headed toward a crisis in health care,   and whether they were satisfied with the quality and cost of their   current health care. Concerning ways to reduce the cost of a national   health care plan, respondents were asked whether they would be willing   to go to clinics rather than to private doctors, wait longer for   appointments, give up the right to sue for malpractice, or give up   coverage of expensive procedures. In addition, respondents were asked   which country in the world they thought did the best job of making sure   people had affordable health care, whether they approved of the way   George Bush was handling the problem of providing affordable health   care for all Americans, and if they thought it was more likely that   Bush or the Democrats in Congress would come up with a plan to provide   affordable health care. Background information included respondents'   attitudes and practices in the use of health care and whether they were   without health care coverage within the last 12 months. They were also   asked about the type and quality of their health care coverage, the   amount of health care household members had received in the last 12   months, the cost of their health care coverage, and whether the cost of   this health care had ever been a financial burden. Background   information includes the respondent's voting habits in the 1988   presidential election, party affiliation, political orientation,   attitude towards abortion, voter registration status, age, race,   religion, education, household composition, employment status, and  family income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George H.W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Foreign policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public approval"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
