Through  telephone interviews, campaign managers and appropriate staff were  asked a series of questions regarding the main themes stressed by  their campaign and those stressed by their opponent, including policy  positions, personal characteristics, and political ideology. Their  views were sought on the media coverage of the campaign, including the  policy issues and personality traits emphasized by the  media. Additional questions assessed the effectiveness of their  campaign strategy in communicating with the voters. Part 1, Survey of  Senate Campaign Managers, also includes data on candidate spending  patterns, based on reports filed with the Federal Election Commission  (FEC). Part 2, Content Analysis of Television Ads, examined  televised political advertisements for the same elections. Areas of  investigation included type of advertisement, and the presence of a  photograph, partisanship, endorsements, criticism of opponent, and  candidate's and opponent's political ideology and personality  traits. Newspaper coverage was examined between September 1 and  Election Day during each campaign (Part 3, Content Analysis of  Newspaper Articles). Areas of investigation included the tone of the  article, the mention of criticisms of the candidate and his/her  opponent, poll results, the political horse race, endorsements, and  the candidate's and opponent's campaign resources, political ideology,  personality traits, debate outcome, policy issues, and political advertisements."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"campaign costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"campaign issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"campaign strategies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"media coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Senate"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.A.1.
