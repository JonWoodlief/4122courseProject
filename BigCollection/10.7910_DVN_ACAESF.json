Information was also collected on household composition, household income, spouse’s occupation, and occupation of spouse’s father and of respondent’s father.\r\n \r\nThe dental practitioner survey collected information on: type of practitioner (self-assessment) and extent of special interests; time spent in practice; involvement in continuing education; contact with colleagues; general advice offered by the dentist on the dentist-patient relationship; time spent on different treatment tasks; and attitudes towards the cost of dentistry, prevalence of gingivitis, retention of teeth, auxiliaries, and the undergraduate curriculum.\r\n \r\nBackground characteristics of dentists included age, sex, time in practice and in current practice, and income.

With 16 age-sex groups, the sample size was thus to be 1,152. However, this calculation was based on a simple, single-stage random selection, while the sample design proposed for the survey involved a multi-stage systematic cluster sample, which would increase estimation variance and thus increase the required sample size by a factor of 3, to 3,456.\r\n \r\nThe strata were defined as outlined above, and then the size of each was estimated in terms of population aged 15 or over, using Department of Statistics data.\r\n \r\nThe Territorial Local Authorities (TLAs) were ordered geographically, north to south, within each stratum, and a cumulative measure of size table was produced. Then 68 TLAs were selected by systematic random sampling with probability of selection proportional to the size measure. The number of urban and rural primary sampling units (PSUs) selected reflected the relative sizes of the strata.\r\n \r\nSecondary sampling units (SSUs) were individual census meshblocks or amalgamations of adjacent meshblocks so that the minimum eligible population in any SSU was 50.\r\nWithin each selected PSU, 2 SSUs were selected by systematic random sampling with probability proportional to size – thus 136 SSUs were selected.\r\n \r\nAppropriate sampling fractions were calculated for each SSU so that all adults had an equal probability of selection. Interviewers were given maps with clearly defined start points. They visited each address, recorded the number of eligible inhabitants, and selected eligibles to be surveyed, independent of dwelling, based on the sequence of codes generated for the SSU.
