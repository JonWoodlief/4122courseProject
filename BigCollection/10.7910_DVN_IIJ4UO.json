Yet practically no systematic\r\nevidence exists on what motivates capital-exporting developed\r\ncountries to sign BITs earlier with some developing countries than with\r\nothers, if at all. The theoretical framework from the aid allocation literature\r\nsuggests that developed countries pursue a mixture of self-interest,\r\nforeign need and, possibly, good governance. We find evidence\r\nthat both economic interests of developed countriesâ€™ foreign investors\r\nand political interests of developed countries determine their scheduling\r\nof BITs. However, foreign need as measured by per capita income is also\r\na factor, whereas good governance by and large does not matter. These\r\nresults suggest that BIT programs can be explained using the same\r\nframework successfully applied to the allocation of aid. At the same time,\r\nself-interest seems to be substantively more important than developing\r\ncountry need when it comes to BITs."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-29"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for Foreign Policy Analysis revised.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":80626,"dataFile":{"id":2798981,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/IIJ4UO/XQHHYD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IIJ4UO/XQHHYD","filename":"Article for Foreign Policy Analysis revised.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":5953,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153c3952fdc-1c78ad4e3ae0","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"39abe5d24fcd156e9cf4c68507ce540a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"39abe5d24fcd156e9cf4c68507ce540a"}}},{"label":"Article for Foreign Policy Analysis.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":80626,"dataFile":{"id":2798982,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/IIJ4UO/4SPXG0","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IIJ4UO/4SPXG0","filename":"Article for Foreign Policy Analysis.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":6900994,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153c395d437-60f0edf376db","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:wXJWO8lor0r3siylWQ6Dqw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"015d9b1bbd17a8d5efab76fab24abd8b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"015d9b1bbd17a8d5efab76fab24abd8b"}}}]}}}
