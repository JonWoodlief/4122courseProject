Metal cutting modelling provides an alternative way for better understanding of machining\r\nprocesses under different cutting conditions. Using the capabilities of finite element models, it has recently\r\nbecome possible to deal with complicated conditions in metal cutting. Finite element modelling makes it\r\npossible to model several factors that are present during the chip formation including friction at the chip\r\ntool interface. The aim of improved understanding of metal cutting is to find ways to have high quality\r\nmachined surfaces, while minimizing machining time and tooling cost. Friction behaviour at the chip-tool\r\ninterface is one of the complicated subjects in metal cutting that still needs a lot of work. Several models\r\nhave been presented in the past with different assumptions. In the current model, the Coulomb friction\r\nmodel, which assumes a constant friction coefficient, is used to model the friction in order to simplify the\r\nmodel. The effect of the constant friction model is considered by analyzing the result for several friction\r\ncoefficient values and comparing them to the previous work. As simulation tool for the purpose of this study,\r\nthe FEM software used is DEFORM 3D. DEFORM 3D is a robust simulation tool that uses the FEM to\r\nmodel complex machining process in three dimensions. The simulation results on cutting forces and thrust\r\nforces, and shear angle are compared with experimental data in order to indicate the consistency and\r\naccuracy of the results when conducting the comparison."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IJRISE, IJRISE Journal"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-10-15"}]}},"files":[{"label":"16October2.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88150,"dataFile":{"id":2903540,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/HGD1JP/XWPIBV","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HGD1JP/XWPIBV","filename":"16October2.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":384439,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:157cb90e196-afd8ebd851a9","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1eaf2eec6b7fd4007c523e75a54e47a2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1eaf2eec6b7fd4007c523e75a54e47a2"}}}]}}}
