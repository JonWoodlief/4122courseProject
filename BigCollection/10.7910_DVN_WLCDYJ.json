In 2012, the CFPS carried out the first full-scale follow up survey, which targeted all 14,960 families, and 57,155 members from the 2010 family roster, who were considered CFPS gene members. In addition, individuals newly born to the 57,155 gene members would also be considered the CFPS gene members, while individuals newly married to the existing CFPS gene members would be considered the CFPS core members. By design, gene members are followed regardless of their relationships with their original families, whereas core members are followed as long as they maintain their family relations with gene members.</p>\r\n<p>The 2012 questionnaires share similar structures to those in 2010, although some specific contents have been modified. For example, no community dataset is available in the 2012 wave since the community survey is scheduled to be carried out in every other wave. A cross-wave individual-level dataset file has been added, listing all the individuals who ever participated in the CFPS, as well as their vital records, survey participation status, respondent type, and family ID in each wave.&nbsp;</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"China, Chinese, Panel Study, Event History Calendar (EHC), Household Roster, Family Members, Non-Coresident Members, Newly-Formed Family, Children, Newborn Biological Children, Parental Information, Demographics, Education, Marital Status, Cause of Death, Migration, Current Residence, Community Infrastructure, Family Facilities, Family Assets, Financial Assets and Debts, Real Estate, Land, Income, Family Income, Agricultural Income and Expenditure, Employment, Family Business, Public Transfer, Pension, Retirement, Living Expenditure, Language, Attitude, Ideology, Health, Mental Status, Cognitive Function, Behavior, Time Use, Daily Life, Social Interaction"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sociology, Economics, Demography, Education"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please visit our offical website to see the <a href=\"http://www.isss.pku.edu.cn/cfps/EN/Documentation/wx/\"><em>Published Papers</em></a> and the <a href=\"http://www.isss.pku.edu.cn/cfps/EN/Documentation/Working%20Paper/\"><em>Working Papers</em></a>."}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<dt><a href=\"http://www.isss.pku.edu.cn/cfps/EN/Data/2012/244.html\">Please Click HERE to Apply for the <em>China Family Panel Studies (2012) Follow-up Data.</em></a></dt>\r\n\r\n<div>For more details, please visit our official website: <em><a href=\"http://www.isss.pku.edu.cn/cfps/en\">www.isss.pku.edu.cn/cfps/en</a></em></div>"},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CFPS Office"},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey Data"]}]}},"files":[{"label":"CFPS 2012 Follow-up Questionnaires.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":131442,"dataFile":{"id":2680979,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WLCDYJ/0RIUAH","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WLCDYJ/0RIUAH","filename":"CFPS 2012 Follow-up Questionnaires.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":4225718,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14db7f9e72a-4bae1a03ec5c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"037228c935dd15ea75aa8fe075517268","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"037228c935dd15ea75aa8fe075517268"}}},{"label":"Supplement to the User's Manual for the 2012 CFPS Data.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":131442,"dataFile":{"id":2680978,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WLCDYJ/GWNFJI","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WLCDYJ/GWNFJI","filename":"Supplement to the User's Manual for the 2012 CFPS Data.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":571773,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14db7fb5e79-4362d10d70b0","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5c488cf787e5a0344170d0078fd0a055","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5c488cf787e5a0344170d0078fd0a055"}}}]}}}
