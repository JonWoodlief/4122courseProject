The first phase of the research involved building a framework  for understanding the types of state-level sentencing and corrections  policies in use between 1975 and 2002. To do this, researchers  reviewed prior analyses of policies to construct an initial outline of  policies or general areas and their characteristics. Next, members of  the Vera Institute of Justice's National Associates Program on  State Sentencing and Corrections (SSC) reviewed the outline, suggested  minor changes in the characteristics detailed, and constructed an  initial data collection instrument (DCI). This initial DCI  microdatabase was pilot-tested by collecting data on three states,  refined, and then a finalized version of the DCI was developed for use  in the second stage of the study. Phase two of the project consisted  of state-level data collection for all 50 states for all study  years, 1975 to 2002. The year 1975 was chosen as the cut-off\nyear  since, according to most criminologists and practitioners, most of the  dramatic changes in state-level sentencing and corrections policies  have occurred post-1975. The principal investigators and six research  assistants began by analyzing microfiche versions of state codes as  amended in 1975. Microfiche versions of superseded state codes  (including supplements) and state sessions laws were then used to  collect data on changes to each state's code for each year between  1975 and 2002. Data collection generally involved reading the entire  criminal law and criminal procedure sections of each state's 1975  code, locating the relevant policy, and recording information about  the provisions of the policy into the DCI. Annual code supplements  were then analyzed to note changes to each state's code. When a  revised version of the entire code was published, data collection then  involved reviewing the entire criminal law and criminal procedure  sections of each state's code again. Where changes to policies were  unclear from annual supplements, microfiche versions of state sessions  laws were consulted, which provided the actual legislation altering  the code. This process continued until data collection reached 2002,  and analysis turned to the bound versions of state codes as amended in 2002."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The dataset contains outcome variables, control  variables, and policy variables. The outcome variables pertain to the  change and growth in state-level incarceration rates between 1975 and  2002. Control variables include violent crime rate, property crime  rate, percent population between ages of 18-24, percent population  between ages of 25-34, percent population African American, percent  population of Hispanic origin, percent population living in urban  areas, percent adherents to \"fundamentalist\" religion, income per  capita, unemployment rate, percent population below poverty level,  GINI income distribution coefficient, state revenues per 100,000  residents, public welfare per 100,000 residents, police officers per  100,000 residents, drug arrest rate, corrections expenditures per  100,000 residents, citizen political ideology, government political  ideology, governor's party affiliation, and region. Policy variables  capture information regarding sentencing structure, drug policy, time  served requirements, habitual offender laws (HOL), and mandatory  sentences. Specifically, sentencing structure variables include  information on determinate sentencing, structured sentencing,  presumptive sentencing guidelines, voluntary sentencing guidelines,  and presumptive sentencing. Drug policy variables include sentencing  enhancement score (cocaine, heroin, and marijuana), severity levels  for possession and sale (cocaine, heroin, and marijuana), minimum  sentence for 28 grams of cocaine (sale), maximum sentence for the  lowest quantity of cocaine (possession), minimum sentence for 28 grams  of heroin (sale), maximum sentence for the lowest quantity of heroin  (possession), minimum sentence for 500 grams of marijuana (sale), and  minimum sentence for the lowest quantity of marijuana (possession).  Variables regarding time served requirements include both time served  (all offenses) and time served (violent offenses). The habitual  offender laws variables capture information regarding the two-strikes  law, three-strikes law, HOL targeted for violent offenses, and HOL  targeted for drug offenses. Lastly, variables pertaining to mandatory  sentences include number of mandatory minimums for weapons use, number  of mandatory minimums for violent offenses, number of mandatory  minimums for offenses against protected individuals, number of  mandatory minimums for offenses committed while in state custody, and mandatory score."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"corrections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug law offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"imprisonment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mandatory sentences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postrelease programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivists"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sentencing reforms"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sentencing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sentencing guidelines"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
