Additional data cover program location, dates of release from the program and from jail, type of program termination, type of residence upon release, and anticipated post-custody treatment. Information on each conviction/disposition was obtained through state criminal information systems, and state-level criminal history data (rap sheets) were collected for both the treatment and comparison groups.

Three of the programs were located in  California: Jail Education and Treatment (JET), Deciding, Educating,  Understanding, Counseling, and Evaluation (DEUCE), and Rebuilding,  Educating, Awareness, Counseling, and Hope (REACH). Two programs were  in New York State: Substance Abuse Intervention Division (SAID) and  New Beginnings. The data were collected by sampling offenders who  entered and exited the programs during the evaluation period. In most  sites, program participants were interviewed by a program staff member  or NCCD researcher at both program admission and release. If personal  interviews were not possible, client files were examined. The  admission data were collected to (1) provide a description of the  offenders served, (2) provide a basis for comparing treatment and  control groups to assure no a priori differences, and (3) provide a  set of \"offender\" variables that could potentially predict outcome.  To develop comparison groups, strategies tailored to each site had to  be developed. For most sites, a sample of offenders serving time in  the same facility but not participating\nin drug treatment was obtained  (through computerized files) by matching on race, age, primary  offense, and sentence length. A 12-month cut-off date was determined  for each person based on his or her jail release date. Conviction and  disposition data during the three years prior to jail admission were  also collected. Although attempts were made to acquire complete  conviction information for all study cases, this was not possible. In  some cases, rap sheets could not be located. It is possible that the  conviction leading to incarceration -- and inclusion in this sample -- was  for an offense that was not reportable to the state, or that conviction was not obtained."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The jail admission form solicited demographic  information such as sex, age, race, education, marital status, and  employment status, as well as information on history of drug use,  mental illness, inpatient/outpatient episodes, and previous drug  treatment.
