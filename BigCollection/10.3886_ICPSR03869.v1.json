Respondents were asked for their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, the economy, and foreign affairs. Respondents were asked their opinion on the condition of the nation's economy and how much credit they gave to Clinton for being responsible for it. Respondents were asked to provide approval ratings for the United States Congress, for the Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and their own representative in Congress. Additional questions asked respondents how much they believed that Congress had accomplished in the past year and which party they believed could better handle the problems that currently faced the country. Questions regarding the United States House of Representatives included whether the respondent was inclined to re-elect their current representative, and whether they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported President Clinton. Those surveyed were asked whether a switch of control in Congress from Democrats to Republicans in the upcoming November election would be a good thing and if they thought it would make a difference. Questions also included whether the respondents trusted the government in Washington and whether they were enthusiastic about how the federal government worked. Respondents were asked to rate which president did the best job, choosing from among Bill Clinton, George Bush, or Ronald Reagan. Respondents were also asked how closely they had been following the upcoming election (which in some states included gubernatorial and senatorial races) and how likely they were to vote in that election. Background information on respondents includes political affiliation, voter registration status, voting record, political philosophy, level of education, age, sex, religious preference, class, area of residence, marital status, labor union membership, employment status, ethnicity, and total household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign affairs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public approval"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States House of Representatives"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
