The focus of this data  collection was on the situation in Iraq and the recent capture of  former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Those surveyed were asked to give  their approval rating of President George W. Bush and his handling of  the situation in Iraq. Respondents were asked to assess the  costs/benefits of the Iraq War\nand to comment on whether they thought  it was worth fighting or not, if they had heard of the capture of  Saddam Hussein, and whether they thought that his capture meant \"the  big challenges facing the United States in Iraq are over.\" Those  polled were asked for their opinion on whether the capture of Saddam  Hussein would help to restore peace and stability in Iraq, would help  to end attacks on United States and coalition forces in Iraq, would  contribute to long-term peace and stability in the Mideast, and would  also contribute to the long-term security of the United States.  Respondents were asked if they believed that United States forces  should leave Iraq now that Saddam Hussein had been captured, or if the  forces should remain in Iraq until a stable government was in place.  Additional questions included whether those surveyed felt that Saddam  Hussein should be put on trial by an Iraqi tribunal or a United  Nations tribunal, and what punishment they preferred for him.  Respondents' perceptions of the progress in Iraq was also measured. Demographic information includes political affiliation and gender."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hussein, Saddam"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Iraq War"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public approval"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
