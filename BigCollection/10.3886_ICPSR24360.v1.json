Respondents were asked for their opinions of George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency and other issues such as foreign policy, the condition of the national economy, what was the most important problem facing the country, the situation in Iraq, the campaign against terrorism, and whether they approved of the way the United States Congress was handling its job. Respondents were also queried on their stance on abortion. A number of questions were asked concerning the 2008 presidential election. These included whether the respondent would vote for the Republican or Democratic candidate, how much attention they paid to the 2008 presidential campaign, one issue that they would like to hear the candidates discuss, and their level of enthusiasm about voting in the election. They were asked to give their opinion of presidential candidates including Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, Mike Huckabee, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama. Respondents were queried on which candidate they preferred to represent the Democratic and Republican parties, whether they thought the presidential candidates had strong religious values, if they had more honesty and integrity than most people in public life, and if they would remove a large number of troops from Iraq in their term as president. Opinions were collected on how important it was that a presidential candidate pledge not to raise taxes, their stance on social issues such as abortion and same sex marriage, and global warming for the respondent's vote for president. Respondents were asked if they favored or opposed a program that provides health insurance for some children in low income families, and if they would be willing to pay more in taxes in order to fund the expansion of this program. Questions concerning the war in Iraq included whether the respondent thought the United States did the right thing in taking military action there, how things are going for the United States in its efforts to bring stability and order to Iraq, how much longer would they be willing to have large numbers of United States troops remain in Iraq, if the troop surge i\nn Iraq was making the situation better, and if the war in Iraq was a part of or separate from the war on terrorism. Additionally, respondents were asked if they noticed what country the goods they purchase are manufactured in, the overall quality of manufactured goods produced in China, and if they stopped buying products made in China as a result of recent recalls. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, household income, marital status, religion, religiosity, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, and the presence of household members between the ages of 18 and 24."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush
