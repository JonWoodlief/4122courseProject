A survey experiment was administered to a representative sample of the U.S. population in which individuals’ perceived likelihood of a future terrorist attack on American soil was manipulated. The purpose of the survey is to address two hypotheses which state that a higher perceived threat from a terrorist attack will make individuals more supportive of public policies designed to combat terrorism and the effect of threat\ninformation on support of public policies designed to combat terrorism will be stronger among Democrats who believe an attack is likely.  The respondents were picked for the study through Random Digit Dialing administered by Knowledge Networks and sent a questionnaire over the Internet.  Variables treated in this study fall into two general groups: demographics and attitudes towards anti-terrorism polices. Demographic variables include race, age, education, income, and geographic region. The anti-terrorism policy variables revolve around four broad questions that deal with wire-taps, libraries reporting to the federal government, airline restrictions, and U.S. military attacks against terrorism."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ideologies"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement/first responder"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorism"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"perceptions"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Malhotra, N., & Popp, E.

The first is half-sampling of telephone numbers for which no address could be found. The second is RDD sampling rates proportional to the number of phone lines in the household. The third is minor oversampling of Chicago and Los Angeles due to early pilot surveys in these two cities. The fourth is short-term double-sampling of the four largest states (CA, NY, FL, and TX) and central region states. The fifth is under-sampling of households not covered by MSN TV. The sixth is oversampling of minority households (Black and Hispanic). Finally, the seventh weight is the selection of one adult per household. In order to calculate final weights, the researchers derived weighted sample distributions along various combinations of five variables. The first is gender (male, female). The second is age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 and over). The third is race/ethnicity (White, Black, other, Hispanic). The fourth is region (northeast, Midwest, south, west). Finally, the fifth variable is education (highest level achieved: less than high school, high school, some college, college degree or more). Similar distributions are calculated using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau's Current Popul\nation Survey data and the Knowledge Network panel data. Cell-by-cell adjustments over the various univariate and bivariate distributions are calculated to make the weighted sample cells match those of the U.S. Census and the Knowledge Network panel."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The response rate was 62.8%."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Threat_Perceptions_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43265,"dataFile":{"id":2300763,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Threat_Perceptions_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":285371,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69563","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e80e21a6621ec00f7ea74d047de657ea","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e80e21a6621ec00f7ea74d047de657ea"}}},{"description":"","label":"Threat_Perceptions_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43265,"dataFile":{"id":2300759,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Threat_Perceptions_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":272269,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69559","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:KSpUdTV8nPBD5KgsY9gdqA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2c863bd49f777c59c7100025606bf18d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2c863bd49f777c59c7100025606bf18d"}}},{"description":"","label":"Threat_Perceptions_Questionnaire.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43265,"dataFile":{"id":2300760,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Threat_Perceptions_Questionnaire.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":88846,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69560","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e9c464186f3b04da3649c45fee7882b5","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e9c464186f3b04da3649c45fee7882b5"}}}]}}}
