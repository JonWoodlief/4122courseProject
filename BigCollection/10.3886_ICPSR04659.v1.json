A national sample of 1,229 adults was surveyed, including an  oversample of 27 Black respondents and 202 respondents aged 65 and  older. Part 1 contains data on non-oversample respondents and Black  oversample respondents, while Part 2 contains information asked only  of respondents aged 65 and older, including the aged 65 and older  oversample. Respondents were queried on whether they approved of the  way President George W. Bush was handling the presidency, and issues  such as the economy and the campaign against terrorism. Respondents  were also asked whether they approved of the way the United States  Congress and their own representatives were handling their jobs,  whether they would vote for a Democratic or Republican candidate in  the upcoming United States House of Representatives election, the  importance of issues such as health care in their voting choice, and  which party they trusted to handle the main problems the nation would  face over the next few years. Views were also sought on the war in  Iraq, whether United States military forces in Iraq should be  withdrawn, and whether Iraq was currently in a state of civil war. A  series of questions asked how much respondents knew about the new  Medicare prescription drug program, whether they approved of it, and  who was responsible for its creation. Respondents aged 65 and older  were asked whether they took prescription drugs, whether they had  signed up for the new Medicare prescription drug program, whether it  saved them money, and whether the enrollment deadline should be  extended. Other topics addressed the recent increase in gasoline  prices, illegal immigration, government waste, a new Massachusetts law  requiring all residents to have health insurance, and whether Congress  should officially reprimand or impeach President Bush for authorizing  wiretaps on suspected terrorists without court approval. Demographic  variables include sex, age, race, household income, marital status,  education le\nvel, political party affiliation, political philosophy,  voter registration status, religious preference, whether respondents  considered themselves born-again or evangelical Christians, and whether they and their parents were born in the United States."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George
