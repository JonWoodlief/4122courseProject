For the purposes of the PHDCN  Longitudinal Cohort Study, the EASI Temperament Survey was  administered both to subjects and primary caregivers (PC). The young  adults comprising cohort 18 completed the EASI Temperament Survey as a  self-report inventory, while the primary caregivers of children  belonging to cohorts 3 through 15 completed the EASI Temperament  measure as a parental ratings survey. Respondents were asked to  determine how accurately the behaviors or personality traits  mentioned, characterized the subject in question, either themselves or  their child.

It was  designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of  both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the  project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,  adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the  project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these  social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data  about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and  resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which  was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over  6,000 rand\nomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and  their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing  circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,  that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial  behaviors. The age cohorts include birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18  years.

Buss and Plomin, the  originators of the EASI Temperament Survey, defined the four  temperaments in the following manner. Emotionality refers to the  individual's intensity of reaction to a given set of circumstances.  Activity is the total amount of energy expended by a person.  Sociability is characterized by a desire to be with other people. And  Impulsivity is the inclination to respond to various impulses and  urges quickly as opposed to constraining those responses. The EASI  Temperament Survey was given to both subjects (Cohort 18) and primary  caregivers (Cohorts 3-15) in order to ascertain whether or not the  subjects participating in the Longitudinal Cohort Study exhibited characteristics describing one or more of the four temperaments.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p><strong>Project on Human Development in Chicago  Neighborhoods</strong></p>\n\n<p>The city of Chicago was selected as the research site for the PHDCN  because of its extensive racial, ethnic, and social-class diversity.  The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into  343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of  racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.  The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were  composed of geographically contiguous census tracts and geographic  boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered  in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately  8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample  of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21  strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with  the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to  eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic  status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected  at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing  of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.  Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts  (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through  in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the  80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within  six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were  selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of  8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the  eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.</p>\n\n<p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the  child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to  spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research  assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child  interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face  interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the  personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews  were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete  protocol\nwas translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was  hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,  Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,  participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other  incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly  drawing prizes were also included.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For  example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking  traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,  delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and  self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also  interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,  parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental  health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emotionality, Activity, Sociability, and Impulsivity (EASI)  Temperament Survey</strong></p>\n\n<p>There have been several versions of the Emotionality, Activity,  Sociability, and Impulsivity (EASI) Temperament survey, however each  successive version attempted to measure the temperamental inclinations  of the respondents being observed. The EASI Temperament Survey as it  appeared in the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort Study was a 40-item  questionnaire that obtained information about the participant's  tendencies regarding four temperaments: sociability, activity,  emotionality, and impulsivity. It was administered to parents of  subjects, ages 3 to 15. Subjects, age 18, completed the survey for  themselves. The response format for questionnaire portion of the EASI  Temperament Survey was 1 = uncharacteristic, 2 = somewhat  uncharacteristic, 3 = neither, 4 = somewhat characteristic, and 5 =  characteristic. Respondents were required to select one and only one  answer for each question. The mean response of various questions was  taken to form ten different scales that assessed distinct aspects of  the subject's temperamental makeup. Scores ranged from 1 to 5 with  higher scores suggesting that the particular trait was more characteristic of the subject being observed.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Emotionality, Activity, Sociability, and  Impulsivity (EASI) Temperament Survey data contains a total of 50  variables. The first 40 variables contained the responses of the  subjects and primary caregivers to whom the survey was administered  during Wave 1 of the Longitudinal Cohort Study between the years of  1994 and 1995. The variables were all numeric due to the absence of  open-ended questions in the survey instrument. In addition to the  variables containing the respondents' answers, the dataset included  ten scale variables. These scales were computed by taking the mean of  the numeric responses to various questions found in the survey. For  example, the Emotionality scale was determined by taking the mean of  the responses to questions 9, 11, 16, 17, and 34 of the EASI  Temperament Survey. The values for the scale variables were continuous  values from 1 to 5. Variables for the Impulsivity, Inhibitory Control,  Decision Time, Sensation Seeking, Persistence, Activity, Sociability,  Shyness, and Sociability/Shyness scales were present in addition to  the Emotionality scale.
