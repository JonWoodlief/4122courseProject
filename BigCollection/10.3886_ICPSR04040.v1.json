Respondents were asked to rate their own personal  health and the importance of a healthy diet and physical exercise in  their lives. Questions were posed regarding how often respondents and  their children watched television, used the Internet, e-mail, or  computer games for personal use, and engaged in moderate or vigorous  physical exercise, how much influence their children had on what food  the family ate, whether they kept a supply of fresh fruits and  vegetables in their home, and whether they or their children were  overweight. Respondents were polled on how often they ate at fast-food  restaurants, whether they tried to track the amount of calories,  carbohydrates, and fat content in their daily diets, whether they  wanted to lose or gain weight, whether they had followed any type of  weight-loss program, and whether it had helped them. Several questions  asked about the hardest part of losing weight, the biggest causes of  obesity in the United States, whether respondents had ever felt that  they were discriminated against because of their weight, whether they  had any negative feelings about people who were overweight, and  whether certain groups or institutions such as the fast-food industry  and government policies and laws bore any responsibility for the  nation's obesity problem. Respondents were also polled on whether they  would support or oppose government policies such as a tax on high-fat  or high-sugar foods, requiring labels on certain foods warning of the  health risks of being overweight, and setting a legal limit on portion  sizes in restaurants. Other topics addressed whether health insurance  companies should be able to drop coverage or charge higher premiums to  people who are overweight, whether schools should be allowed to raise  money by allowing soda and candy vending machines in school, the  seriousness of problems such as cancer, AIDS, cigarette smoking,  obesity, and drug and alcohol abuse as public health issues, and  whether the federal government was doing enough about these problems.  Background information includes sex, ethnicity, education, marital  status, household income, number and sex of children in household,  weight and height of respondents and children, and subjective size of the community: rural, urban, or suburban."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"body weight"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"diet"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"eating habits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"exercise"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fast food industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"obesity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR XII.
