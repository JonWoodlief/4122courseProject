For the victim-level file, Part 1, data are provided on the  relationship of victim to offender, whether the victim or offender had  previously committed a violent or nonviolent offense, time of  occurrence and place of homicide, type of weapon used, cause and  motivation for the incident, whether the incident involved drugs,  alcohol, gangs, child abuse, or a domestic relationship, if or how the  offender was identified, and information on the death of the  offender(s). Demographic variables such as the age, sex, and race of  each victim and offender are also provided. The victim-level file  contains one record for each victim. Information for up to five  offenders is included on each victim record. The same offender  information is duplicated depending on the number of victims. For  example, if a sole offender is responsible for five victims, the file  contains five victim records with the offender's information repeated  on each record. Part 2, Offender-Level Data, is provided to allow the  creation of offender rates and risk analysis that could not be  accurately prepared using the victim-level file due to the repeating  of the offender information on each victim record. Offender variables  were reorganized during the creation of the offender file so that each  known offender is associated with a single record. A majority of the  variables in the offender-level file are replicas of variables in the  victim-level file. The offender records contain demographic  information about the offender, demographic and relationship  information about the offender's first victim (or sole victim if there  was only one), and information about the homicide incident.  Information pertaining to the homicide inciden\nt such as location,  weapon, or drug use are the same as in the victim-level file. In cases  where the offender data were completely missing in the victim-level  data, no offender records were generated in the offender-level  file. The offender-level data do not contain information about the  victims in these cases. Geographic variables in both files include the census tract, community area, police district, and police area."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"homicide"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"murder"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police departments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"relationships"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victims"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"weapons"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
