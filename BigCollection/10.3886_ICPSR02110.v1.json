Final edited data are on file for 2,939 reporting units. Data for 388 of the 449 nonrespondents were imputed (estimated) using their data from fiscal year 1985 (HEGIS XX). The data on current funds were inflated using the 1986 Higher Education Price Index, while the remaining data were adjusted by multiplying the end-of-the-year balances from HEGIS XX by the 1985 national averages. The remaining 61 nonrespondents were placed on the file with zero-filled data in Part A, Line 01, since no data were available for the previous year. All imputed data for total nonrespondents may be identified by a \"1\" in record position 161. The Master File contains final edited data for 2,939 reporting units, imputed data for 388 nonrespondents, and zero-filled records for 61 nonrespondents. One hundred thirty-four reporting systems or institutions submitted data for noncampus entities or combined data. Allocation for these reports was completed and all data cells reporting allocated data are flagged with a \"3\" in columns 155-160.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For the first time, total current funds revenues and total current funds expenditures and mandatory transfers for fiscal year 1986 exceed $100 billion.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The numeric data fields (Position 83-148) are regular signed numeric fields.
