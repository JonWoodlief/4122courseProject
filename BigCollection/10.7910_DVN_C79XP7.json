Applying the method of causal process-tracing to the Swiss ‘Carlos’ case, a blame game triggered by the reporting about an expensive therapy setting for a youth offender, this article exposes and explains a hitherto neglected, but highly important, mechanism between political elites engaging in blame-generation and changes in policy practice. A policy’s distance and visibility to mass publics, as well as the incentives and resources of elites to engage in blame-generation, explain the dynamics within blame games, which, in turn, effect organizational and behavioral changes that help to institutionalize a more politicized policy practice. Politicized policy practice can make an important difference to policy target populations, as well as damage output legitimacy and undermine democracy."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-21"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Elite polarization"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policy failure"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"blame avoidance"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policy practice"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hinterleitner, Markus"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-21"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This file contains replication data for Figure 1.
