A random  sample of arrestees was taken from those arrested in Washington, DC,  during the period July 1, 1985, to June 6, 1986. The sample was  stratified to overrepresent groups other than Black males. Drug use  was determined by urinalysis results at the time of arrest, as  contrasted with previous studies that relied on self-reports of drug  use. The research addresses the following questions: (1) Does drug use  have an influence on participation in violent criminal activity? (2)  Does drug use influence the frequency of violent offending? (3) Is  there a difference in the types and rates of violent offending between  drug-using offenders who use stimulants and those who use depressants?  Variables regarding arrests include date of arrest, drug test result,  charges filed, disposition date, disposition type, and sentence length  imposed. Demographic variables include race, sex, birthdate, and place of birth."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The study was conducted to examine the  relationship between drug use and violent criminal behaviors.

(2) Does drug  use influence the frequency of offending for violent crimes? (3) Is  there a difference in the types and rates of violent offending between  drug-using offenders who use stimulants and those who use depressants?  This research may impact criminal justice decisions by delineating the  role of drug use in different aspects of violent offending. The  research suggests that drug use may be an aggravating factor among  drug-using violent offenders who commit violent crimes at higher  frequencies and over more extended time periods than do nonusing violent offenders."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Longitudinal arrest data for a sample of arrestees  were collected to characterize the violent offending patterns of drug  users and nonusers. The sample included adults arrested in Washington,  DC, on any charge from July 1, 1985, to June 30, 1986. Data were  collected from case files maintained by the Washington, DC, Pretrial  Services Agency for 1,368 arrestees and 7,117 arrests. Previous and  subsequent arrests of the same individual were linked together to form  an arrest history. Arrest histories date back to 1943 and continue  through 1990. A major emphasis of the study was to refine measures of  offending in order to better distinguish different aspects of violent  offending by drug users and nonusers. Offending by drug users and  nonusers, as determined by outcomes of urinalysis at the time of  arrest, was characterized in terms of several distinct aspects of  individual offending, particularly: (1) participation in violence  estimated from the fraction of arrestees with any arrests for violent  offenses, (2) frequency of violence reflected in the annual rate of  violent criminal activity by these active offenders, and (3) termination rates of ending involvement in violent activities."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data are contained in three different record  types.
