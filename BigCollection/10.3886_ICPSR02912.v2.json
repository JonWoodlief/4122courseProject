Unlike previous years, the data are presented in nine separate  parts: Part 1, Work Done Record (Replacement or Additions to the  House), Part 2, Housing Unit Record (Main Record), Part 3, Worker  Record, Part 4, Mortgages (Owners Only), Part 5, Manager and Owner  Record (Renters Only), Part 6, Person Record, Part 7, Mover Group  Record, Part 8, Recodes (One Record per Housing Unit), and Part 9,  Weights. Data include year the structure was built, type and number of  living quarters, occupancy status, access, number of rooms, presence  of commercial establishments on the property, and property value.  Additional data focus on kitchen and plumbing facilities, types  of heating fuel used, source of water, sewage disposal, heating and  air-conditioning equipment, and major additions, alterations, or  repairs to the property. Information provided on housing expenses  includes monthly mortgage or rent payments, cost of services such as  utilities, garbage collection, and property insurance, and amount of  real estate taxes paid in the previous year. Also included is  information on whether the household received government assistance  to help pay heating or cooling costs or for other energy-related  services. Similar data are provided for housing units previously  occupied by respondents who had recently moved. Additionally,  indicators of housing and neighborhood quality are supplied. Housing  quality variables include privacy of bedrooms, condition of kitchen  facilities, basement or roof leakage, breakdowns of plumbing  facilities and equipment, and overall opinion of the structure. For  quality of neighborhood, variables include use of exterminator  services, existence of boarded-up buildings, and overall quality of  the neighborhood. In addition to housing characteristics, some  demographic data are provided\non household members, such as age, sex,  race, marital status, income, and relationship to householder.  Additional data provided on the householder include years of school  completed, Spanish origin, length of residence, and length of occupancy."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"commuting

All  interviews are conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing  (CAPI) software, allowing new responses to some questions. Rather than  existing as a single file, this collection consists of nine parts,  each containing data pertaining to a specific subject-matter. In  addition, data for building and neighborhood questions ceased to be  collected through interviewer observation. Rather, these questions  have been reworded for the respondents. Due to these changes, users  are asked to use caution when comparing data prior to 1997 with data  from 1997 forward. For further information about the redesign, please  refer to DOCUMENTATION OF CHANGES IN THE 1997 AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY  included with this collection.

The same basic sample of  housing units is interviewed every two years until a new sample is  selected. The sample was updated by adding newly constructed housing  units and units discovered through coverage improvement efforts every  enumeration. For the 1997 American Housing Survey-National sample  (AHS-N), approximately 53,100 sample housing units were selected for  interview. About 2,200 of these units were found to be ineligible  because the unit no longer existed or because the unit did not meet  the definition of a housing unit. Of the 50,900 eligible sample units  (both occupied and vacant housing units), about 5,000 were classified  as \"Type A\" noninterviews because (a) no one was at home after  repeated visits, (b) the respondent refused to be interviewed, or (c)  the interviewer was unable to find the unit. This produced a  90-percent overall response rate. The American Housing Survey sample  consists of the following types of units in the sampled primary  sampling units: Housing units selected from the 1980 census, New  construction in areas requiring building permits, Housing units missed  in the 1980 census, and Other housing units added since the 1980  census.
