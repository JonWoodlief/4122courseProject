The dataset was prepared using a sample of individuals from the 1970 Census whose occupations had been coded with both 1970 and 1980 Census detailed occupational codes. This file, known as the Treiman file, was merged with selected variables from the FOURTH EDITION DICTIONARY OF OCCUPATIONAL TITLES, using 1970 occupational categories as the merge varia\nble. A score on each Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) variable was then computed for each 1980 occupational category. Included among the DOT variables were such characteristics as (1) level of complexity at which the worker functions in terms of data, people, and things, (2) training required to do the job, (3) verbal, numerical, spatial, and other aptitudes needed to perform the job, (4) percent of workers in the job with a preference for a specific type of job activity such as abstract and creative activity or activity requiring business contact with people, (5) temperamental attributes such as adaptability to performing under stress and adaptability to performing repetitive work, (6) physical demands of the job, and (7) environmental conditions under which the work is performed. Measures of mean hourly and annual earnings for both men and women in each occupation and number of men and women in each occupation also are included."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job skills"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor force"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
