Therefore, in order to get an overview about the status of indicators to be targeted through various communication activities it was proposed and finally decided in consultation with UNICEF representatives that a total of 100 structured questionnaires would be canvassed in selected 10 villages. The criteria for selection of the villages was based on the tribal population of the selected blocks and it was decided that a total of 6 villages dominated by Santhal tribe and 2 villages each dominated by Sauria Paharia and Mal Paharia to be undertaken for the research purpose.  A total of 100 structured questionnaires were canvassed in order get an overview about the possible indicators targeted through various communication activities. The villages for data collection were purposively selected based on the distance (proximal and distant located) from the block headquarter and it was done in consultation with NGOs, selected by UNICEF for carrying out Routine Immunization (RI) bundling activities. Full list of household having pregnant and lactating mothers was obtained from Anganwadi worker (AWW) for the purpose of selecting respondents.  Subsequently, this list was used as sample frame for selecting respondents. Five males and five females were randomly selected using currency note method from this list in each village. Ten structured interviews were conducted in each selected villages. and Apart from this in-depth interviews (IDI) with either the AWW or Sahiya was conducted in each village. Hence, total ten IDIs were conducted. Additionally, a total of ten focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with male and female groups, separat\nely. FGDs were conducted in a nearby village (having similar tribal dominance) located at close proximity of the selected village."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Qualitative"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In-depth interview, Focus-group discussion"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Caregivers"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Malaria"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LLIN use"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"BCC"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"UNICEF"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"INDIA (2009): Piloting LLIN communication for prevention of malaria among pregnant women and children (ages 0-1) in Jharkhand.
