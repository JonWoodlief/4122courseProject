Respondents were asked for their opinions of  President Bill Clinton, the United States Congress, First Lady Hillary  Clinton, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, the nation's economy, and  the direction of the country. Those queried were asked to rate the  likelihood that they would vote in the election and to declare which  party's candidates they intended to vote for. Respondents were also asked  whether their decisions were driven by a desire to express support for  or opposition to either Clinton or the Republican Congress. Their  views were sought on the importance of the following issues in their  electoral decisions: education, taxes, the Clinton/Lewinsky matter,  Social Security, health care, moral and ethical standards, the  economy, and jobs. Additional topics covered the future of Clinton's  second term, the impeachment hearings and surrounding investigations,  the Republicans' handling of the investigation, and whether Clinton's  relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky had\ndamaged his ability to serve effectively as president. Background  information on respondents includes age, sex, political party,  political orientation, education, race, religion, voter registration  and participation history, family income, marital status, employment status, labor union membership, and age of children in household."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
