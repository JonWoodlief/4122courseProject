The study tested the intercorrelations among various behaviors seen as reflecting identification, and looked at child-rearing antecedents of these behaviors as well.\r\n<br /><br />  The sample consisted of 40 nursery school children, 21 boys and 19 girls, and their parents. The children's mean age was 4 3/4 years and the parents ranged in age from 22 to 45 years.<br /><br />  Parental data were collected by taped interviews. Forty mothers and 40 fathers were interviewed separately using similar forms. Interviews inquired about caretaking activities; methods of handling early feeding, toilet training, disobedience, sexual activity, dependency, and aggression; attitudes and feelings about the child's independence, achievement, moral behavior, self-control, responsibility, and adult-typed and sex-role-stereotyped behavior; and family atmosphere and parents' attitudes toward themselves and each other. Paper-and-pencil instruments consisted of a demographic data sheet, mother's attitude scales, a child behavior-maturity scale answered by mothers, and a Winterbottom scale measuring the mother's pressure on her child to develop independence. Observational measures were two half-hour observations of mother-child interaction, and time-sampled behavioral observations of the child's activities while at school. The extensive child assessment included a variety of scales, experimental situation, and projective play techniques which tapped preference for sex-typed activities and roles, tendency to assume an adult role, resistance to temptation, guilt responses, and manipulative fantasy behavior.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds all numeric file data from parent and child measures. Typed transcripts of the mother and father interviews are also part of the collection."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mra"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"50 or fewer"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sampsize"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"female, male"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gender"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"0-5, mixed"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Age"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"White"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Race"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"middle"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SES"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Generations"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Mental health"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Family.
