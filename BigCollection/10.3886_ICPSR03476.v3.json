Additional questions focused on the respondents'  knowledge of and opinions about the European Union (EU), including how  well-informed they felt about the EU, what sources of information  about the EU they used, and whether their country had benefited from  being an EU member. In relation to politics, respondents were asked  whether the process of decision-making about select issues should be  done by their country alone, the EU or jointly, and whether the EU  should develop a constitution and common foreign, defense and security  policies. A major focus of the survey included the euro, EU  enlargement, radioactive waste, family planning, and Internet usage. A  battery of questions was posed to respondents regarding how  well-informed they were about the euro, whether replacing national  currencies with the euro was a good idea, how comfortable they felt  using the euro, and the future effects of the introduc\ntion of the  euro. Another set of questions sought respondents' opinions on EU  enlargement including which countries they favored become EU members  and associated criteria for membership, the future effects of  enlargement, how well-informed they were about EU enlargement and what  sources they sought to obtain information regarding this subject. For  the next topic, respondents were asked about how well- informed they  were about radioactive waste, what institutions they would trust in  their country or in other EU countries to provide information about  this subject, production of radioactive waste, waste disposal and the  costs for the construction of an underground disposal site, and their  knowledge and concerns regarding radioactive waste management in their  home countries, the EU, and in countries wishing to join the EU.  Family planning was also addressed by the surveys, as respondents were  queried about their ideal family size, the number of children they  had, how old they were when they had their first child, and how many  children they wanted to have. In addition, the survey asked  respondents whether they used the Internet, and if so, how often and  from what location. Other demographic and background information  provided includes age, gender, nationality, marital status, left-right  political self-placement, occupation, age when stopped full-time  education, household composition, household income, type and size of locality, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic
