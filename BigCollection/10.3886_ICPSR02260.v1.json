This census, known  as the Directory Survey, gathers data on 49 primary state law  enforcement agencies and all sheriffs' departments, local police  departments, and special police agencies (state or local) that are  publicly funded and employ at least one sworn officer with general  arrest powers. The 1996 Directory Survey collected data on the number  of sworn and nonsworn personnel employed by each agency, including  both full-time and part-time employees. Within the full-time sworn  category, data were collected from all agencies on the number who were  uniformed officers with regularly assigned duties that included  responding to calls for service. For agencies with at least 10  full-time sworn officers, the number whose primary duties were related  to investigations, court operations, or jail operations was also  obtained. This data collection, compiled in June 1996, represents the  third such census, with the first occurring in 1986 (DIRECTORY OF LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, 1986: [UNITED STATES] [ICPSR 8696]) and the  second in 1992 (DIRECTORY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, 1992: [UNITED  STATES] [ICPSR 2266]). Variables include personnel totals, type of  government, type of agency, and whether the agency had the legal authority to hold a person beyond arraignment for 48 or more hours."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"authority"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"full time employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement agencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"part time employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police departments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policies and procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personnel"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
