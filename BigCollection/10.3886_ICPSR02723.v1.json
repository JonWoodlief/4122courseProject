Those queried were asked whether they believed that the  Senate's verdict was based on fact or on partisan politics, whether  Clinton should face criminal charges for his actions, and whether the  Senate should censure or politically reprimand Clinton. Additional  topics covered the federal law allowing a special prosecutor, the  government's ability to handle charges of lawbreaking by a president,  whether constituents felt strongly about their congressional  representative's and/or Senator's vote during the impeachment process,  and views on Clinton's apology following his acquittal.
