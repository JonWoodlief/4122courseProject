The researchers collected information on 3,662 suspects arrested for misdemeanor domestic violence (specifically, assault against an intimate) in Hamilton County, Ohio, during August 1, 1993, to October 31, 1993, and January 1, 1995, to December 31, 1996.

Aggregate-level census measures (proportion of  college-educated individuals, proportion of employed individuals,  proportion of financially independent residents, etc.) were included  to determine the extent that these neighborhood characteristics  correlate to an individual's propensity to recidivate and/or conditioned relationships between formal controls and recidivism."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To study empirical relationships between court  dispositions and the prevalence, incidence, and delay of recidivism  for domestic violence, the researchers collected information on 3,662  suspects arrested for misdemeanor domestic violence in Hamilton  County, Ohio, during August 1, 1993, to October 31, 1993, and January  1, 1995, to December 31, 1996.
