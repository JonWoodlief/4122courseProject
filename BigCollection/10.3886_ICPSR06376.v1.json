The RCG survey, which focuses  heavily, but not exclusively, on those graduates qualified to teach at  the elementary and secondary levels, is designed to meet the following  objectives: (1) to determine how many graduates become eligible or  qualified to teach for the first time and how many are employed as  teachers in the year following graduation, by teaching field, (2) to  examine the relationships among courses taken, student achievement,  and occupational outcomes, and (3) to monitor unemployment rates and  average salaries of graduates by field of study. The RCG survey  collects information on education and employment of all graduates  (date of graduation, field of study, whether newly qualified to teach,  further enrollment, financial aid, employment status, and teacher  employment characteristics) as well as standard demographic  characteristics such as earnings, age, marital status, sex, and race/ethnicity."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic achievement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"college graduates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"earned degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment qualifications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupational status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher certification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teacher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teaching qualifications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment rate"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"wages and salaries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.

Institutions were stratified by control (public or   private), by region, and by the proportion of degrees awarded in the   field of education (over or under a specified number). Within each of   these strata, institutions were selected according to size (size being   measured by the sum of bachelor's and master's degrees awarded that   year). The second stage consisted of the selection of a core sample of   graduates (bachelor's and master's degree recipients) who received   their degrees from the sampled institutions during the 1974-1975   academic year. Sampling rates of graduates differed by major field of   study. The sample consisted of 200 institutions and 5,800 graduates.   The student strata were degree, special education, other education, and  all other major fields.
