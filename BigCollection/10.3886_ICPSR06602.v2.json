Simpson murder  trial. Respondents were asked whether the criminal justice system and  the media were biased toward O.J. Simpson and other Blacks or against  them, and whether the trial affected the way white people view Black  men. Additional race-related questions asked respondents whether they  thought there would be more media coverag\ne or less if a white  celebrity had been accused of the same crimes as Simpson or if Simpson  had been accused of murdering two Black people. The role of the news  media and whether they had been too harsh or too easy on Simpson in  their coverage of his trial was also explored. The respondents'  feelings about Simpson were probed in questions that asked how much  sympathy they had for him because of everything that had happened, and  if they had personally thought of him as a role model before the  murders. Background information on respondents includes voter  registration status, household composition, vote choice in the 1992  presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
