The argument focuses on the relationship between income inequality and adoption of longevity-enhancing innovations. It asserts that longevity change should be influenced by preexisting levels of income inequality and that, consequently, income inequality can cause differential longevity improvement across jurisdictions even if inequality levels remain unchanged. State-level U.S. data from 1970 to 2000 are used to jointly model the effects of initial levels and change in income inequality on 10-year life expectancy change. Results confirm that states with higher levels of inequality experienced less subsequent improvement in life expectancy. Contrary to findings from prior research, analyses also reveal a strong negative association between change in inequality and change in longevity once initial levels of inequality and other state characteristics are controlled. Finally, direct tests of the relationship between income inequality and the adoption of innovations in quality of medical care indicate that the two are highly related and that differences in the average quality of care can account for the negative cross-sectional association between income inequality and life expectancy."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"USA; Income inequality; Longevity; Wilkinson hypothesis; Health determinants"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clarkwest, Andrew, 2008, \"Neo-materialist theory and the temporal relationship between income inequality and longevity change\" Social Science &amp; Medicine, 66 (9) 1871â€“1881, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953607006910\" target= \"_new\">article available here</a>"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Andrew Leigh"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.andrewleigh.org/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/resources/images/dvnPoweredByLogo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data File","label":"clarkwestineq.csv","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43209,"categories":["2.
