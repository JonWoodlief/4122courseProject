Additionally, respondents were asked what expectations they had for the next 12 months, and what important issues were being faced personally and in their country. Additional questions focused on the respondents' opinions on the EU, including whether their country had benefited from being an EU member, as well as the overall direction of their country, the EU, and the United States, and their trust in certain institutions. The survey queried respondents on their personal financial situations, their views of the lives of children today, views of being socially excluded or becoming homeless, and their trust in the information media. Finally, respondents were asked about their voting behavior in the last parliamentary election in their country and their political party attachment. A second major focus of the surveys was the European Parliament and elections. Respondents were asked about their knowledge and impression of the European Parliament, and their opinions on its role, its policies, and its values. In addition, respondents identified the date of the next\nEuropean elections, their interest and the likelihood of voting in the June 2009 elections, their decision-making criteria when choosing a candidate, their reasons for not voting in the elections, and the main themes on which the campaign for the next elections should concentrate. A third major focus was the economic crisis. The survey queried respondents about the present and future repercussions of the economic crisis, which type of government or other entity is most capable of dealing most effectively with the crisis, the role of the EU and member states in the crisis, whether the adoption or non-adoption of the euro positively or negatively affected the economy of their country, and their opinion of the policies aimed at alleviating the crisis. A fourth major focus was climate change. Respondents indicated their views on how climate change ranked in importance among the world's problems, the seriousness of climate change, and how well-informed they felt about this matter. In addition, respondents were asked about their knowledge of climate change, and the actions aimed to fight it. A fifth and final major focus was chemical products. The survey asked respondents to identify which consumer products contain chemicals that pose a risk to the user, the extent of risk and worry in using certain products, and who they trusted for protection against health and environmental hazards. In addition, respondents were queried on their knowledge of chemical substance exposure, which information sources they preferred and trusted for safety and safe use information about chemical products, the labeling of chemical substances in consumer products, and whether the producer of a chemical product should be held legally responsible for any harm caused by it. Respondents were also asked about reading product instructions, product usage of sunscreen and hair dyes, and the potential health risks and effects of certain chemical substances. Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, nationality, origin of birth (personal and parental), marital status, age when stopped full-time education, occupation, left-right political self-placement, household composition, ownership of a fixed or mobile telephone and other durable goods, type and size of locality, region of residence, and language of interview (select
