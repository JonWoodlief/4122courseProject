For the outcome evaluation the researchers compared how well program graduates fared after program completion with respect to relapse and recidivism compared to program dropouts, as well as to a comparison group of inmates who did not participate in the OCCDTP. Data were collected from the Missouri Department of Corrections, the Missouri State Highway Patrol, a psychosocial assessment of clients entering the OCCDPT program, and three-month and 12-month follow-up surveys.

The OCC Drug Treatment  Program (OCCDTP) consisted of four phases. During Phase One the  treatment staff completed assessments and developed treatment  plans. Phase Two involved intensive treatment for six to nine  months. In Phase Three inmates participated in supervised community  work release projects for three to six months. Lastly, in Phase Four  an aftercare plan was completed. The program activities and total  length of time in the program was about 12 to 18 months. In January of  1998 the National Institute of Justice funded a process and outcome  evaluation of the OCCDTP under the auspices of the Res\nidential  Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) for State Prisoners Formula Grant  Program. The process evaluation (Part 1) focused on (1) changes in  OCCDTP treatment activities, (2) characteristics of OCCDTP  participants, (3) utilization of aftercare, and (4) participant  ratings of OCCDTP and aftercare. The outcome evaluation (Part 2) of  the OCCDTP focused on a cohort of men who had graduated from the  program and were released from prison between July 1, 1996, and  September 30, 1997. The goals of this assessment were (1) to compare  substance abuse prior to incarceration with substance abuse one-year  after release for program graduates who relapsed, and (2) to compare  program graduates with a matched comparison group on selected outcome  indicators. Additionally, the researchers conducted a detailed  analysis of those who participated in the OCCDTP, looking at outcome  indicators for inmates who completed the program and did or did not  participate in the work release program at the prison, as well as for  inmates who were admitted to the program but did not complete the  program. Outcome indicators for all comparisons consisted of relapse,  employment status, participation in educational activities, risk for  AIDS, and technical violations while on parole, as well as recidivism  data gathered from the Missouri State Highway Patrol (Part  3). Intermediate outcomes were assessed by comparing technical  violations during the program periods for program participants, dropouts, and the comparison group."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For the process evaluation (Part 1) data were  collected from four sources. First, client demographic information was  collected from the Missouri Department of Corrections for all persons  admitted to OCCDTP between February 1, 1994, and September 30,  1996. Second, data were obtained from results of a psychosocial  assessment completed on inmates by the contract provider as part of  the initial assessment process as clients entered OCCDTP. The  psychosocial assessment included a variety of social, criminal, and  substance abuse history data. Third, data were collected from a  three-month follow-up survey of clients who successfully completed the  program, which provided information on clients' perceptions of the  program. Lastly, data were obtained from a 12-month follow-up survey  of clients who successfully completed the program. This survey  included client satisfaction information, suggestions for program  improvement, levels of participation in aftercare, and social and  clinical data. In addition to the data collected for the process  evaluation, the outcome evaluation (Part 2) also gathered data from  the Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC). The DOC provided data  collected on men at entry to prison, data from the parole officers,  and data on the inmates' earnings while in prison. The Missouri State  Highway Patrol also provided data (Part 3) about the specifics of arrests, nature of the offense, and charges."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For Parts 1 and 2 inmate information includes date  admitted to and discharged from OCC, results of participation in  OCCDTP, date of birth, race, education, marital status, religious  affiliation, criminal history, IQ, substance abuse history, mental  health care needs, educational and vocational needs, work skills,  public risk, custody rating, and offense classifications. The  psychosocial assessment collected data on living situation, family  situation, legal background, employment background, social activities,  suicide history, abuse history, sexual history, and substance abuse  history. The three-month follow-up survey asked clients to rate the  OCC staff, as well as the counselors' attitudes and behaviors. The  12-month follow-up survey asked clients about their social adjustment,  work history, criminal involvement, drug use, AIDS risk assessment,  and community treatments after leaving OCC. Part 2 also has variables\nmeasuring earned income, exit from prison, return to prison, and  overall outcome.
