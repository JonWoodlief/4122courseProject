Over the course of the survey approximately 15 percent of Baltimore households did not have a landline telephone. In this design, all households with a landline telephone had a known probability of selection into the sample. The sample included four strata. The first three strata were sampled using commercially-available, regularly updated information on Baltimore households.\nThese strata include (1) households believed to contain someone aged 15-35 years, (2) households with no one aged 15-35, and (3) households with residents of unknown age. The fourth stratum was constructed by selecting all known landline telephone numbers in Baltimore, and removing numbers on the original commercial list. Inclusion of this fourth stratum ensured that the probability sample included all households with landline telephones, and that each telephone number was in one and only one stratum. Errors in list-sample information (e.g., households that were erroneously thought to have a resident aged 15 to 35) were eliminated during survey screening. Please see the   MSSP Brief Sampling Description section in the ICPSR Codebook for more information about sampling."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"telephone audio computer-assisted self interview (TACASI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data are not weighted; however, this collection contains the weight variable ADJWGTC, which should be used in analysis. Two sets of sample weights were constructed to adjust for the unequal probabilities of selection based on the stratified sample design and survey nonresponse. Initial weights were developed reflecting the inverse probability of selection within each stratum with adjustments for the differing probabilities of selection within households, the number of landline telephones within the household, and survey nonresponse. A post-stratification adjustment was applied to align the sample distribution with the 2006-2009 United States Census estimates of the Baltimore City population by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. A second set of weights was constructed to compensate for additional differences in the provision of a biospecimen for STI testing among respondents who completed the survey interview. Analysis of these Trichomoniasis data should use the second weight which is named: \"ADJWGTC\". Please see the MSSP Weighting Information section in the ICPSR Codebook for more information about weighting."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Interviews:  58.7 percent.
