The survey collected information on students' use of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, views on campus alcohol policies and student alcohol use, reasons for drinking alcohol and reasons for not drinking or limiting drinking, and personal difficulties caused by drinking problems (e.g., missed classes, injury, and trouble with police). Additional topics covered by the survey include overall health status, daily activities, satisfaction with education being received, grade-point average, living arrangements, social life, sexual activity, use of condoms during sexual intercourse, date rape, drunk driving, and attendance in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, Alanon, Adult Children of Alcoholics, and Narcotics Anonymous.

This version of the data comprises the same 119 schools in the ICPSR 4291 data. Six schools in the previous version were dropped, six schools not in the previous version were added, and six variables (SERIAL, COMMENTS, DATERECD, DATESCAN, FORMCODE, and ipeds) were added. ICPSR revised the documentation accordingly and added a SAS setup file to the collection.

Some variables were removed, others were renamed, and new variables, including two weight variables, were added. Overall, the number of variables increased from 380 to 424 and the case count increased from 14,520 to 14,724.
