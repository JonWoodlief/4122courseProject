In the traditional neopositivist framing, theory frames and disciplines practice, such that scholarly experts can provide valid advice for policymakers to follow -- as long as the \"gap\" between the academy and the world of practical politics is effectively \"bridged.\" Alternative methodologies suggest a more complex relationship, either deriving theory from political practice, or otherwise advocating a mode of theorizing that is closer to the practical world.\r\nInto this morass wades \"practice theory,\" or perhaps better, a practice sensibility. This \"practice turn\" reformulates the meaning of \"theory\" such that the distinction between theory and practice is, so to speak, dis-solved: theorizing is a practical activity, and practice is shot through with theoretical import. Understood as a methodological move, the \"practice turn\" in International Relations thus goes far beyond a mere alteration of independent or dependent variable, and far beyond a change in the level of analysis. Because the epistemic status of theory is different for a scholar committed to a practice sensibility, explanations that such scholars generate are distinctive from explanations produced through a covering-law model of explanation or through qualitative-comparative case study techniques. Practice-sensibility explanations handle agent-structure issues differently, treat the relationship between stability and change as a more internal relation, and emphasize creativity and contingency in ways that go well beyond identifying a causal \"role of ideas.\" [...]"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Symposium"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bueger, Christian, and Frank Gadinger. 2015. “The Play of International Practice.” International Studies Quarterly 59 (3): 449–60. doi:10.1111/isqu.12202.\r\n"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.1111/isqu.12202."}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Nedal, Dani"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-07-24"}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[]}},"files":[{"label":"ISQ Symposium Bueger and Gadinger.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":137273,"dataFile":{"id":3037915,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/NXX3JJ/ALHSSA","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NXX3JJ/ALHSSA","filename":"ISQ Symposium Bueger and Gadinger.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":298383,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15d76bcc5f6-4e718085ef9c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"63a8bcc21432c1850ed7bcf3e5ea1530","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"63a8bcc21432c1850ed7bcf3e5ea1530"}}}]}}}
