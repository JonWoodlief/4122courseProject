To assess changes in health status and health services utilization, the attendants were interviewed at the point of union enrollment, and again nine months later. The interview taken prior to enrollment in the benefits program elicited information about concern over health, recent injuries, and self-assessed health status, e.g., the presence or absence of specific health conditions such as diabetes, ulcers, arthritis, stomach trouble, high blood pressure, allergies, asthma, and back problems. Respondents were also queried about the extent and type of previous health coverage (including Medicare and disability insurance), limitations of daily functioning due to poor health, and recent health care utilization, including hospitalization, emergency room usage, and routine ambulatory care. The latter included questions about out-of-pocket expenses and the type of health services received, such as X-rays, CAT scans, sonograms, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, stress tests, surgery, and setting of bones. Other questions addressed utilization issues of particular relevance to the New York City area, e.g., the use of city hospital clinics. The post-enrollment survey included parallel follow-up questions, as well as questions regarding the respondent's employment status and current benefits. Additional variables in the data collection include respondent's race, Hispanic origin, place of birth, past work experience, date of birth, and sex, plus the sex and dates of birth of family members."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care expenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care facilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health problems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hispanic or Latino origins"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"home care worker"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicare"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"union membership"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.

These approximately 1,700 newly-hired home attendants were invited, by   mail, to come to union headquarters for enrollment and benefits   orientation, and also to participate in a study of health status and   utilization. This group of 1,700 comprised all health attendants newly   hired during the period beginning in February and ending in August   1990. The pre-enrollment survey was administered to these attendants as   they came to the union headquarters. A total of 475 attendants were   interviewed. Because of the constant flow of home attendants into the   union headquarters for enrollment, no attempt was made to interview   every newly-hired home attendant but rather to interview a substantial   number as they became available. Approximately nine months later,  follow-up interviews were obtained with 360 of the 475 sample members."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Follow-Up Interview Household Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41978,"dataFile":{"id":2664142,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Follow-Up Interview Household Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Follow-Up Interview Individual Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41978,"dataFile":{"id":2664144,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Follow-Up Interview Individual Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Pre-Enrollment Interview Household Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41978,"dataFile":{"id":2664141,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Pre-Enrollment Interview Household Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Pre-Enrollment Interview Individual Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41978,"dataFile":{"id":2664143,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Pre-Enrollment Interview Individual Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
