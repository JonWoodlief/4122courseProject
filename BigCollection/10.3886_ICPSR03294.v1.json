Respondents were asked whether they approved of President George W. Bush's response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as well as his proposed remedies, what the consequences were of various levels of military action that could be taken in response to the terrorist threat, and how they viewed the state of the nation's economy. Respondents were also asked whether they watched or listened to any of Bush's address to Congress on September 20, 2001, how much Bush's proposed measures such as stricter airport security, stronger law enforcement efforts, and the creation of a new White House office for domestic security would reduce the risk of another major terrorist attack in this country, and whether Bush's speech made respondents more or less confident in the ability of the United States to deal with the crisis. Assuming that the groups and nations responsible for the terrorist attacks were identified, respondents were asked whether they would support military action against these groups, and whether they would support military action even if it meant getting into a war.  Opinions were elicited on whether the United States should limit its military action to the terrorist groups and nations responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks or broaden its actions to include all terrorist groups and nations, whether taking or not taking military action would result in a greater risk of further terrorism in this country, whether large numbers of troops would be killed and wounded, and whether military action would last for a few weeks, a few months, a year or so, or several years. Concerning the nation's economy, respondents were asked to describe the current state of the economy as excellent, good, not so good, or poor, and to comment on whether the economy was heading into a recession.
