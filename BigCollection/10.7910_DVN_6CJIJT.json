The study identified changes and stability in the qualities older women attribute to their close friendships. It also explored whether life changes (e.g., marital status, work status or health status) influenced the qualities women identified in their close friendships.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnother aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between perceived equity and the women's feelings about their friendships. The types of instrumental and affective exchanges older women have with their friends were identified and compared across friendships. The study focused on instrumental exchanges between close friends, their joint participation in social activities and the women's patterns of self-disclosure with their close friends.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe sample included 110 women aged 65-92, living in the Madison area, who had participated in both waves of Traupmann-Pillemer's McBeath Institute Aging Women Project (Log# 00595).
