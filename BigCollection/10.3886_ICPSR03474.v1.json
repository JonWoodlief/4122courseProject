The specific goals of the  study were: (1) to determine drop-out points along the continuum of  the treatment model and to review the case files to discover any  patterns in client participation and review demographic data in the  program, and (2) to assess what current participants thought about the  program and treatment model. For Part 1, Recent Graduate Data, data  were secured from case files of women who had been discharged from the  Therapeutic Community (Key Village) program in Baylor Women's  Correctional Institute in 1999. This analysis was used to prepare the  survey instrument used for the interviews given to the women currently  participating in the program. For Part 2, Client Assessment  Satisfaction Data, the current residents of the program were  interviewed. During fall of 2000 and spring of 2001, a survey was  developed to assess how the current participants viewed the Key  Program. The questions were intended to gather information to assess  the gender appropriateness of the program. A database was constructed  to search for any consistencies or variables that would address the  issue of gender appropriateness or lack of such in the operation of  the program from the participants' point of view. During the interview  period there were a total of 88 women in the Key Program. Of the 88  women, 76 agreed to participate in the study. For Part 1, the  variables cover demographic data, criminal history information,  medical information, prior drug treatment histories, and program  success or failure. Part 2 variables cover demographic information,  and questions dealing with prior drug use, the first four weeks of the  program, the confrontation aspects of the program, sanctions and  program rules, staff/participant interaction, program activities and  responsibilities as opposed to the general population, readiness for  change, support systems, children's visits and children as motivation,  physical aspects of the program, mental health, the need for  additional vocational and educational services, significant aspects and experiences from the program, and desired changes to the program."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The overall goals of the process evaluation were  to assess the participants' views on the Residential Substance Abuse  Treatment (RSAT) program at Baylor Women's Correctional Institute and  to determine whether the women thought the program met their needs  specifically based on gender.
