The Rural Program was developed to enhance the safety of abused women and children living in rural areas. It provided funding to states, local and tribal governments, and private or public entities in rural states to create or improve collaborations among criminal justice agencies, service providers, and community organizations to enhance services and the response to women and children who were victims of domestic violence. The program reflected the Department of Justice's commitment to improve the criminal justice system's response to battered women and sexually and physically abused children living in isolated rural communities and to enhance the response of rural communities to these victims.</p>\n\n<p>The process evaluation (Parts 1-8) assessed the implementation of grant activities for the 89 grantees funded in fiscal years 1996 to 1998.

The outcome evaluation conducted an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the Rural Program by identifying and assessing outcomes for nine grantees.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>\n\n<p>The process evaluation assessed the implementation of grant activities for the 89 grantees funded in fiscal years 1996 to 1998. The process evaluation included review of grant documentation, phone interviews with all 89 grantees, interviews with Violence Against Women Office (VAWO) grant managers, and site visits to 16 grantee programs. The grantees were selected for process evaluation site visits from information obtained during the phone interviews and interviews with VAWO grant managers. The purpose of the site visits was to further assess program implementation, relevant community context affecting problems or needs being addressed by the grantee, the expected results of grant funding, and the feasibility of conducting an outcome evaluation of the project during the outcome evaluation phase of the National Rural Evaluation.</p>\n\n<p>The outcome evaluation phase of the National Rural Evaluation used a combination of methods to identify the results of the Rural grantees' efforts in addressing domestic violence and child victimization. Methods included site visits and data collection through review of documentation and archival records, interviews, and direct observation. Data analysis included both qualitative and quantitative methods.</p>\n\n<p>Site Selection</p>\n\n<p>Nine grantees were selected for the outcome evaluation. All of the selected grantees were among the 16 sites that had received a site visit during the process evaluation and had received continuation funding in fiscal year 2000. The selection process included a review of grant documentation and process evaluation site visit reports to determine whether data sources were available to document long-term outcomes and whether program activities were sufficiently mature to warrant an outcome evaluation. A group of sites that represented the range of organizational types, program activities, priority areas being addressed, and targeted groups being served by the grantees was selected. The nine grantees selected for the outcome evaluation were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Florida Department of Children and Families</p></li>\n<li><p>Inter-Tribal Council of California</p></li>\n<li><p>Iowa's Office of Drug Control Policy</p></li>\n<li><p>Lower Umpqua Victims' Services</p></li>\n<li><p>Missoula County Office of Planning and Grants</p></li>\n<li><p>North Dakota Council on Abused Women's Services</p></li>\n<li><p>Oregon's State Office for Services to Children and Families</p></li>\n<li><p>South Dakota Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault</p></li>\n<li><p>Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Site Visits</p>\n\n<p>Site visits were conducted from November 2000 to May 2001. The visits were two to three days in length and were conducted by two-person teams. The purpose of the site visits was three-fold: (1) to conduct interviews and focus groups to collect qualitative data regarding changes in services, policies and practices, interagency collaboration, and the lives of victims, (2) to examine whether the grant intervention or other factors (rival hypotheses) may have contributed to these changes, and (3) to collect quantitative data from criminal justice, health, and social service agencies to examine changes and trends relevant to grant activities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data was collected through review of documentation and archival records, interviews, and direct observation.</p>\n\n<p>Review of Documentation</p>\n\n<p>Documentation was reviewed for each of the grantees and included administrative documents, such as grant applications and progress reports; grant award documents; minutes of meetings conducted by the grantees; memoranda of understanding; evaluation reports and qualitative data compiled by local evaluators; a monograph, and newspaper clippings and articles appearing in the local media of the grantees.</p>\n\n<p>Review of Archival Records</p>\n\n<p>Archival records reviewed for the grantees included service records indicating the number of clients served; service data indicating the number of protection orders issued; a statewide database of child welfare cases; organizational records, such as organization charts and budgets; membership lists; census data; data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System, where available; and data from the National Court Information System, where available.</p>\n\n<p>Interviews</p>\n\n<p>Interviews conducted were of several types: open-ended, focused, and survey. Interviews were conducted with grant managers with the Violence Against Women Office, grantee program staff, agency staff, medical personnel, school personnel, law enforcement officers, attorneys, members of the judiciary system, community service providers, community members, service recipients, and elected officials. Interviews were conducted in-person and by telephone. Additionally, one survey was administered by e-mail.</p>\n\n<p>Direct Observation</p>\n\n<p>Direct observation was made throughout the two site visits conducted with the grantees to assess the socioeconomic conditions in the communities in which the grantees operated and to observe community settings where grant activities took place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<p>Data analysis included qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods included the use of logic models. The nested ecological model served as a guiding framework in categorizing components of the logic model.</p>\n\n<p>Qualitative Methods</p>\n\n<p>The National Rural Evaluation used the case study design as the primary analytic tool. The case study design was selected because activities being evaluated were complex, community-wide interventions implemented in sites with very diverse characteristics. Differences in activities, target populations, and community characteristics make it difficult to find comparison or control groups.</p>\n\n<p>Logic Models</p>\n\n<p>A logic model depicted graphically the theory of each program in a way that linked program activities to program results. Logic models included the following elements: (1) relevant context in which grant activities were implemented; (2) key assumptions that formed the foundation of grant activities; (3) program activities of the grantees; and (4) outcomes achieved by the grantees following implementation of program activities.</p>\n\n<p>The Nested Ecological Model as a Guiding Framework</p>\n\n<p>An overriding conceptual framework for the evaluation was the nested ecological model, first developed by Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979) to explain human behavior in the context of larger systems in wh\nich the individual functions. The concept of \"nested\" interconnected systems provided a framework for viewing the activities of the Rural program as \"transforming experiments [which involve] the systematic alternating and restructuring of existing ecological systems in ways that challenge the forms of social organization, belief systems and lifestyles prevailing in a particular culture or subculture\" (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).</p>\n\n<p>Interviews</p>\n\n<p>A combination of open-ended and focused interviews was conducted with grantee staff. Open-ended interviews were used to gather qualitative evidence of the changes grantee staff had observed in the community before and after funding was received from the Rural grant program. Open-ended interviews also were conducted with grant managers from the Violence Against Women Office prior to the site visits to obtain any relevant information about the site, to be alerted to any potential problems experienced by the site, and to obtain any information about specific issues that might be particularly helpful in conducting a successful outcome evaluation with the site.</p>\n\n<p>Focused interviews were conducted with grantee staff to refine the logic model. Specifically, interviews were conducted to confirm community context information, identify actual versus planned activities, anticipated outcomes from grant activity, and identify possible rival factors that may account for outcomes achieved by the grantees.</p>\n\n<p>Quantitative Methods</p>\n\n<p>Data analysis was conducted using the Statistical Program for Social Science (SPSS) and Microsoft Excel. Summary statistics were generated to compare the frequency of correct responses to pre- and post-tests conducted by one of the grantees to assess increased knowledge of domestic violence as a result of receiving training. Summary statistics also were used to compare the number of hours and percentage of time technology was used by member programs at two points in time.</p>\n\n<p>A statistical examination of 2,217 child welfare cases in the state of Oregon was conducted by data analysts at the Oregon State Office for Services to Children and Families (SCF) and the Child Welfare Partnership at Portland State University for the Rural evaluators to identify outcomes for cases that had domestic violence advocate involvement.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p><strong>Part 1</strong>\n(Grant Application Data) contains information

All of the selected grantees were among 16 sites that had received a site visit during the process evaluation phase of the National Rural Evaluation and had received continuation funding in fiscal year 2000. The selection process occurred in the following steps:</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: The evaluation team reviewed grant documentation and grant applications for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 for the 16 sites that received site visits during the process evaluation phase. One grantee that had not received continuation funding was eliminated from the selection process.</p>\n\n<p>Step 2: The evaluation team reviewed the process evaluation site visit reports to determine whether data sources were available to document long-term outcomes and whether program activities were sufficiently mature to warrant an outcome evaluation. Three sites without data sources or mature program activities were eliminated from consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Step 3: The evaluation team categorized the grantees by: (1) organization type; (2) rural versus non-rural state; (3) priority areas being addressed; and (4) types of data the grantees reported having access to.</p>\n\n<p>Step 4: The evaluation team further categorized the grantees by types of evaluation-related activities the grantees had conducted. Types of evaluation-related activities included: (1) used an independent evaluator; (2) conducted a needs assessment prior to grant activities; (3) collected baseline data; (4) conducted any internal or external assessments, such as client surveys; (5) consistently tracked activities; (6) submitted up-to-date progress reports; and (7) had identified possible outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Step 5: The evaluation team met with the National Institute of Justice and the Violence Against Women Office to discuss the pool of twelve candidates to participate in the outcome evaluation. It was agreed to select a group of sites that represented the range of organizational types, program activities, priority areas being addressed, and targeted groups being served by the grantees.  Initially, 10 grantees were selected for the outcome evaluation.  However, one of the sites, a fiscal year 1999 grantee, was unable to obtain funding to continue program activities when their Rural grant was exhauste\nd and subsequently did not participate in the outcome evaluation due to the termination of program activities, resulting in a final group of nine grantees.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record
