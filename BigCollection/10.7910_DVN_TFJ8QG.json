The purpose of the study was to establish the status of  fruit production, processing and marketing in Malawi with respect to the following aspects: the  policy environment, trends in demand and supply of fruits and fruit products, marketing  infrastructure and institutions and farmer groups involved in the fruit industry. The study  involved a review of literature on Malawiâ€™s horticulture industry with emphasis on the fruit sub-sector. Consultations with various stakeholders supplemented the literature review.  The study revealed a number of constraints that have hindered development of the fruit industry  in Malawi. The constraints can broadly be categorized into policy related, technical and  technological issues and institutional arrangements which include market organizations. On  policy, the study noted that there is no policy and clear strategies on horticulture and that there is  limited government and private sector support on production, marketing and processing of  horticultural commodities. On the technical and technological aspects, the study revealed that  there is limited expertise on post harvest handling especially amongst the smallholder farmers,  low production levels and poor quality products due to poor germplasm and inadequate supply of  tree seedlings for increased fruit production which would feed into the processing industry.  In terms of institutional arrangements, the study revealed that there are ineffective and  inefficiently managed farmer organizations due topoor leadership and limited management skills  on the part of executive members for the farmers organizations and lack of entrepreneurship skills  amongst most smallholder farmer\ns. The study also noted that there is lack of organized markets,  poor marketing infrastructure including market information system and low prices offered on  horticultural commodities due to low quality and inefficient markets.   The study makes a number of recommendations including the need for a clear policy, strategies  for developing an enabling regulatory environment for the promotion of fruit production,  processing and marketing; the need for improved marketing infrastructure including the  establishment of specialized markets (physical infrastructure) with facilities for handling fruits  and fruit products. Strengthening farmer organizations/cooperatives,improved advisory services  and improved access to credit are also recommended. The study also recommends promoting  investment in value-adding technologies through tax reforms and funding of research in low cost  value-adding technologies. Lastly but not  least, the study recommends strengthening  collaboration and coordination through strong public-private-partnerships."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-03-26"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Fruits"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Center for Agricultural Research and Development"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LUANAR"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CARD"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.bunda.luanar.mw/index.html"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.bunda.luanar.mw/header.png"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Center for Agricultural Research and Development"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LUANAR"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CARD"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.bunda.luanar.mw/index.html"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.bunda.luanar.mw/header.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-04-16"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Kachule and Franzel (2009) Working paper on fruit.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51945,"categories":["Report"],"dataFile":{"id":2434529,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Kachule and Franzel (2009) Working paper on fruit.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1292368,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:105828","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b8d30909ad6e3bc860066fa2477ecb03","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b8d30909ad6e3bc860066fa2477ecb03"}}}]}}}
