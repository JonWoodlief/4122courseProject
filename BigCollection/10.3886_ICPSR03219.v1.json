The  study was conducted in part to assess respondents' interest in and  opinions about the 2000 election campaign for United States senator  from New Jersey. New Jersey residents gave their opinions of  candidates Jon Corzine (Democrat) and Bob Franks (Republican), as well  as their opinions of President Clinton, New Jersey governor Christie  Whitman, New Jersey senator Robert Torricelli, New Jersey state  senator Donald DiFrancesco, New Jersey gubernatorial candidates Jim  McGreevey (Democrat) and Bret Schundler (Republican), and candidates  for president and vice president, Al Gore and Joe\nLieberman  (Democrats), and George W. Bush and Dick Cheney  (Republicans). Respondents were also queried about their readiness to  vote in the upcoming Senate election, whom were they going to vote  for, and who, in their opinion, would become state  senator. Respondents answered a set of questions comparing Corzine and  Franks as Senate candidates in terms of their experience, interest in  people like themselves, and political philosophy, as well as who would  do more to improve education and make health care affordable for  everyone. The survey also sought respondents' opinions on the use of  the federal budget surplus, the role of the federal government in  local education policy, the role of the federal government in ensuring  access to affordable health care, and whether it would be preferable  to have a smaller government providing fewer services or a larger  government providing more services. Respondents' views were elicited  on whether limits should be placed on the amount of their own money  candidates can spend on their campaigns, whether candidates' use of  funds from political action committees was problematic, the amount of  his own money Corzine was spending on his campaign, and whether the  fact that Corzine was spending $1 million each week on his campaign  made respondents more or less likely to vote for him. Respondents were  queried as to whether they had seen any Corzine or Franks campaign  commercials on TV, whether they had watched any debates between  Corzine and Franks, whether they had received any Corzine or Franks  campaign literature through the mail, and whether that information had  influenced their electoral decision. Respondents were also asked for  whom they intended to vote in the upcoming presidential election: Al  Gore (Democratic Party candidate), George W. Bush (Republican Party  candidate), Pat Buchanan (Reform Party candidate), or Ralph Nader  (Green Party candidate). Additional questions probed respondents'  views on issues such as abortion, requiring all gun owners to register  their firearms, the appropriate criminal punishment for murder, and  the most important factor in deciding how they would vote in the New  Jersey senate election. Background information on respondents includes  age, gender, political party, political orientation, marital status,  education, children in household, voter registration and participation  history, Hispanic descent, race, years in community, gun ownership, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
