An increase in liberal policy rhetoric can serve as an indicator of an executive branch that will, in general, attempt to increase government involvement in policy areas that have a significant bearing on the economy. Such policy rhetoric is a cue that should lower the extent of uncertainty about what the characteristics of economic policy will consist of. The recent development of a historical indicator of economic policy uncertainty in the United States allows researchers to assess whether the style employed in presidential rhetoric has any bearing on the extent of economic policy uncertainty that is present in the socio-political environment. The vector autoregression time series analysis performed in this project suggests presidential ideological tone Granger-causes economic policy uncertainty. The moving average representation analysis indicates an increase in presidential rhetorical liberalism results in a decrease in the\r\neconomic policy uncertainty index for a period of time. Chief executives in the United States could be strategically expressing language supporting the expansion of federal government involvement in domestic affairs to mitigate the level of uncertainty about economic policy that is present in the socio-political environment."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Economic policy uncertainty, presidential rhetoric, macroeconomics and the presidency, policy liberalism, time series analysis, United States political economy"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Article: \"Policy rhetoric can have economic consequences: Presidential rhetorical liberalism and economic policy uncertainty.\" Journal of Global Economics, Management and Business Research. 4 (2): 65-80."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Olds, Christopher"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-08-11"}]}},"files":[{"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses contrasting presidential rhetorical liberalism and historical economic policy uncertainty.","label":"OldsPresidentialLiberalismEconPolicyUncertaintyCommands.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":76214,"dataFile":{"id":2698927,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/IAUUQJ/6DD8UB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/IAUUQJ/6DD8UB","filename":"OldsPresidentialLiberalismEconPolicyUncertaintyCommands.txt","contentType":"text/plain","filesize":13312,"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses contrasting presidential rhetorical liberalism and historical economic policy uncertainty.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14f1ce83343-be6efdccdc6b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"c4ed18c2dc1ac93b71c2ebbb880ee1d8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"c4ed18c2dc1ac93b71c2ebbb880ee1d8"}}},{"description":"Quarterly information spanning between 1948 and 2005.
