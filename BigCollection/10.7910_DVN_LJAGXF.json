The photography was done between the months of May June July after the long rains and when the maize crop has taslled.  The photos are obtained using an aircraft flying at 1500m above ground level and equipped with a 35-mm camera, a 200mm lens and a 200 Ektachrome film. The slides produced are projected onto\na 100 Dot grid paper on a wall and analysed for land use land cover and any other land parameters required. The number of times a certain use or cover type corresponds with the dot is recorded as the percentage cover for that type. The other parameters as mentioned in the introduction were directly counted on the projected slide and recorded as described later. A total of approx. 5700 slides were interpreted.  The information was recorded and entered into computer using Access data entry forms and saved in Excel Format. The objective of the project was to interpret the 1997 land use / land cover Low level flying Aerial Sample Photos to derive the following information,  a.)Percentage land use / land cover estimates for 5,747 aerial photo slides according to categories identified in Table 2 of the document b.)The number of mabati houses, thatched houses, houses with or presence of electrical poles, houses adjacent to or presence of streams or irrigation channels, number of schools, worship houses and factories. c.)The number of gullies d.)Percentage tree canopy cover e.)Percentage area under severe soil erosion"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Place, F.; Kristjanson, P.; Staal, S.; Kruska, R.; Wolff, T. de; Zomer, R.; Njuguna, E. 2005.
