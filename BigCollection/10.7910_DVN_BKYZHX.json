This current project assesses whether economic policy uncertainty in the United States compels the U.S. president to increase the linguistic and substantive simplicity of public remarks. In an attempt to either decrease rising economic policy uncertainty, or stop the occurrence of economic policy uncertainty altogether, the president can choose to discuss issues in a very simple way. Time series analyses of monthly information spanning between 1993 and 2013 indicate that an increase in the economic policy uncertainty index results in an increase in presidential rhetorical simplicity. This provides an initial indication that the rhetorical strategy of linguistic and substantive simplicity employed by presidents can be shaped by economic conditions."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic policy uncertainty, rhetorical simplicity, presidential rhetoric, presidential communications, political communications, Flesch readability"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Article: \"Analyzing the economic policy uncertainty index and presidential rhetorical simplicity in the United States.\" The Empirical Econometrics and Quantitative Economics Letters 3(2): 15-32."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Olds, Christopher"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-04-29"}]}},"files":[{"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses of economic policy uncertainty and presidential rhetorical simplicity in the United States.","label":"OldsEconPolUncertaintyRhetoricalSimplicityCommands.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":69552,"dataFile":{"id":2670897,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/BKYZHX/W98L0A","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BKYZHX/W98L0A","filename":"OldsEconPolUncertaintyRhetoricalSimplicityCommands.txt","contentType":"text/plain","filesize":11067,"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses of economic policy uncertainty and presidential rhetorical simplicity in the United States.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14d041ca887-f9ff97a117b6","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"26022d54288616b93993a1dbf6b20415","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"26022d54288616b93993a1dbf6b20415"}}},{"description":"Monthly information spanning 1993 to 2013.
