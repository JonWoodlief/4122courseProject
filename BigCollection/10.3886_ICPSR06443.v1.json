Sponsored by the National Endowment for the   Arts, and conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau   of the Census, this survey was a supplement to a larger national   survey, the National Crime Survey (NCS). Data are provided for all   household members aged 12 and older (excluding crew members of merchant   vessels, armed forces personnel living in military barracks, and   institutionalized persons) in sampled households. Respondents were   asked about their past-year participation in, and frequency of   attending, art performances and events in the following categories:   jazz music, classical music, opera, musicals, plays (nonmusical),   ballet, other dance, art museums, arts-crafts fairs, and historical   park/design sites. Reasons for nonparticipation were also collected.   Additionally, demographic information including age, sex, race, marital   status and education level is\navailable. New questions added in the   1992 survey concerned the use of video cassette recorders (VCRs),   various dance forms other than ballet, and different types of popular   music. In general, the 1992 survey asked more varied and detailed  questions about arts participation."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVI.A.
