This was the origin of the Elections Archive in the University Library of the University of Calif\nornia, San Diego. The objective of the Archive is to systematically collect election statistics in as much detail as possible, including, as a minimum, the results at the level of the individual election districts in which votes are converted into seats.\n<br /><br />\r The original scope of the Archive was the national election results in hard-copy format for the lower or only house of the legislature and for any directly elected upper house in the twenty-seven older democracies from 1945 on (the West European democracies plus the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, India, Israel, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand). The scope has expanded in several directions: more countries, a longer time span, sub-national as well as national elections, and d\nata in machine-readable format. <br /><br />\r \r Arend Lijphart is Research Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego. He is the author of Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Comparative Study of Twenty-Seven Democracies, 1945-1990 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994) and many articles on elections and electoral systems in Electoral Studies and other journals. The Archive Director is Gary W. Cox, Department of Political Science, University of Califor\nnia, San Diego."}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: This study was deposited under the of the Data-PASS standard deposit terms.
