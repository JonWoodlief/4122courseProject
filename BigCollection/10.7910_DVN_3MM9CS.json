I study 27 episodes in which the executive branch closed the legislature or the legislature removed the chief executive from office between 1950 and 2000.  It is hypothesized that the democratization of Latin American presidential systems has hindered the ability of presidents to challenge the legislature and encouraged the emergence of congressional supremacy (i.e., the capacity of congress to impeach the president if a serious conflict emerges). Three causal mechanisms account for this outcome: 1) a lower likelihood of military intervention, 2) the elimination of constitutional tools used by authoritarian presidents to dissolve congress, and 3) greater stability in the constitutional environment. After discussing the limitations of conventional maximum-likelihood tests, I assess this hypothesis using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative model."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidentialism"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"QCA (qualitative comparative analysis)"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fuzzy sets"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential crises"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pérez-Liñán, Aníbal. 2005.  “Democratization and Constitutional Crises in Presidential Regimes: Toward Congressional Supremacy?” Comparative Political Studies 38 (1): 51-74."}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Murray Research Archive"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/logos/10/mra_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-04-11"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1950"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2000"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Events (n=27)"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Latin America"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Presidential crises leading to the dissolution of one of the two elected branches (presidency or legislature) in Latin America, 1950-2000"]}]},"customMRA":{"displayName":"MRA Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"mraCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Politics and Government"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"CPS2005_14.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":133792,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":1548930,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"CPS2005_14.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":1681,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:56157","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:5SFiJB2RXAoU6CeTf23Yag==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ff5e3b7de2650c597e9944df1f1211c6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ff5e3b7de2650c597e9944df1f1211c6"}}},{"description":"Syntax file to replicate analysis (SPSS)","label":"CPS2005.SPS","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":133792,"categories":["Replication"],"dataFile":{"id":1546689,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"CPS2005.SPS","contentType":"text/x-spss-syntax; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":586,"description":"Syntax file to replicate analysis (SPSS)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:55472","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"caa9c9380e6e62399d7ef40aa4b719bc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"caa9c9380e6e62399d7ef40aa4b719bc"}}}]}}}
