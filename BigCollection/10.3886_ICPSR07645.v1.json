(CQ) for the years 1945 to 1982 (79th-97th  Congresses). Part 1 contains voting scores for members of the United  States Senate, and Part 2 contains such scores for the members of the  United States House of Representatives. In both parts, the unit of  analysis is the individual member of Congress. The identification  variables in each file include member name, member's state, and  member's party. In most instances a set of scores is presented for  each member of Congress, for each session of the Congress, and for the  Congress as a whole (both sessions). For the 96th and 97th Congresses  (1979-1980, 1981-1982) scores for both sessions combined are not  provided. The major types of CQ voting scores in the data collection  are: (1) \"voting participation score,\" indicating member's attendance  (not to be confused with the CQ \"on the record\" score which shows how  often the member has taken a stand on all issues), (2) \"partisan  voting score,\" calculated on a subset of the total roll calls that CQ  designated as \"party unity\" roll calls, e.g., roll calls in which a  majority of voting Democrats opposed a majority of voting Republicans  (with exceptions in the 83rd and 88th Congresses when a \"party voting\"  score was released), (3) \"bipartisan voting score,\" consistently  figured by CQ on a subset of the total bipartisan roll calls, i.e.,  those in which a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans  voted the same way (until 1978 when the score was no longer reported),  (4)\"conservative coalition score,\" based on a subset of roll calls in  which a majority of voting Southern Democrats and a majority of voting  Republicans opposed the position of a majority of voting Northern  Democrats, (5) \"presidential issues score,\" which rates members on  those roll calls dealing with issues on which the president has  clearly and previously stated a personal position (from 1955 to 1970,  this score was further subdivided into support scores for foreign and  for domestic policies of the president), (6) \"federal role score,\"  which gauges the Congressperson's support and opposition of moves for  a larger or smaller federal role (in earlier Congresses, CQ used a  similar process to figure \"economy support,\" opposition scores that  were designed to represent a member's position on moves to limit or  increase federal spending), and (7) a set of interest group scores  taken from the CQ WEEKLY REPORTS and added to the two data files (for  the years 1960 to 1982) that score each Congressperson's support of  interest groups, i.e., Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), the  Americans for Constitutional Action (ACA), the Committee on Political  Education (COPE), and the National Farmers Union (NFU). Interest  group ratings are included only for each session, not for the entire  Congresses. (Beginning with the 1978 session, NFU rating scores were no longer included.)"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional voting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political partisanship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"roll call data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"roll call voting records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"twentieth century"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States House of Representatives"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Senate"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting patterns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIII.A.1.

(2) The major types of voting scores were not tabulated by CQ  for every session and every Congress. Especially in the first years of  its release, Congressional Quarterly had not yet standardized its  voting studies feature. It is possible to find a variety of scores  that occur only once. (In the Senate file for the First Session of the  82nd Congress there is a unique variable for bipartisan voting on  military issues and veterans' affairs.) There are also instances in which  CQ offered only the raw totals normally used to compute its standard  voting scores. Users will note that for the 79th Congress, Second  Session, there are three variables related to voting participation:  number of times voted \"yea\" or \"nay\" on all roll calls, number  of times answered \"present,\" and number of times absent for all roll  calls. No standard voting participation score was calculated by CQ for  that session. Scholars are also advised to check the original  CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY ALMANAC and CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY WEEKLY  REPORT for discussions of the methods used to derive particular  voting scores. It should be noted, for instance, that absences did not  usually affect a member's scores in the first years of the CQ voting  studies. Beginning in 1955, failures to vote were calculated as  negative responses, thus lowering all types of scores except for the  federal role support scores and some of the interest group  scores. Such changes in the derivation of the voting scores may  influence the user's analysis of the data.
