A three-stage public  health model was developed using drug diffusion and community drug  indicators as aggregate measures of individual drug use  careers. Monthly data on drug indicators for Washington, DC, and  Portland, Oregon, were used to: (1) estimate the correlations of drug  problem indicators over time, (2) examine the correlations among  indicators at different stages in the spread of new forms of drug  abuse, and (3) estimate lagged models in which arrestee urinalysis  results were used to predict subsequent community drug  problems. Variables included arrestee drug test results, drug-overdose  deaths, crimes reported to the local police department, and child  maltreatment incidents. Washington variables also included  drug-related emergency room episodes. The unit of analysis was months  covered by the study. The Washington, DC, data consist of 78 records,  one for each month from April 1984 through September 1990. The  Portland, Oregon, data contain 33 records, one for each month from January 1988 through September 1990."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The goal of the study was to extend the use of  arrestee urinalysis results in community planning by examining the  relationships among arrestee drug tests and drug-related emergency  room episodes, drug overdose deaths, crimes, and child abuse and  neglect cases. The conceptual framework that was developed addressed  the issue of temporal relationships among indicators by considering  how the diffusion of new patterns of drug abuse and the course of  individual drug careers would cumulatively affect different  indicators. This required an elaboration of assumptions about how drug  abuse spreads, its effects on individuals over time, and the resulting  cumulative effects on the community over time. The product was a  three-stage public health model of drug diffusion and the influence  drug diffusion might be expected to have on various community drug  indicators when they are viewed as aggregate measures of individual  drug use careers. Stage 1 of the model is the initiation of a new drug  use pattern, Stage 2 is spreading drug use, and Stage 3 is drug use stabilization or decline."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Selection of study sites and community indicators  were determined by data availability. The first criterion was monthly  data on results of urinalysis of arrestees at booking, available for  almost all detained arrestees in Washington, DC, since April 1984. The  additional data on drug-related emergency room episodes, drug overdose  deaths, reported crimes, and reported cases of child abuse and neglect  formed the basis for initial model testing. To examine the extent to  which Washington, DC, might generalize to other communities, Portland,  Oregon, was chosen as a comparison site with similar initial booking  tests of arrestees on a continuous monthly basis and community  indicators similar to those available in Washington, DC.
