The survey collected data on the number of completions of academic, vocational, and continuing professional educational programs by award category. A major subset of all postsecondary institutions are those institutions that are eligible to participate in Title IV aid. It is this group of institutions that annually receives a Completions Survey. Beginning in 1996, the subset of eligible institutions was validated by matching the IPEDS universe with the Postsecondary Education Participation System (PEPS) file which is maintained by the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE). OPE grants eligibility to institutions to participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. This validation process was repeated for determining eligibility, and 6,443 accredited institutions were mailed one of the survey forms. There are four files in the collection. Part 1, Institutional Characteristics, is a comprehensive file pertaining to the characteristics of all the institutions surveyed (i.e., religious affiliation, highest level of offering, enrollment by race/ethnicity, Carnegie classification, etc.). Part 2, Postsecondary Completions: Awards/Degrees Conferred, contains the number of degrees and other awards granted by the institution in each field of study (CIP code), by level of award/degree, and by race/ethnicity and sex of recipient, with totals for full-time and part-time new and continuing students. Part 3, Clarifying Questions, contains responses to the two clarifying questions included in the survey: (1) number of double majors by level of degree and sex of recipient, and (2) number of awards/degrees by branches located in foreign countries, by level of award/degree, and by sex of recipient. Part 4, Postsecondary Completions by Major Discipline (Two-Digit CIP Codes), contains the number of degrees and other awards conferred by major discipline (two-digit CIP code), award level, race/ethn\nicity, and sex of recipient."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"associate degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"bachelors degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"doctoral degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"earned degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"masters degrees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
