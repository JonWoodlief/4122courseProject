The survey series was initiated in 1989 by the Puget Sound Council of Governments (now known as the Puget Sound Regional Council); Wave 9 was conducted in 2000. This collection contains the ninth set of panel data for approximately 2,000 households in King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. Due to various sources of attrition, approximately 20 percent of households need to be replaced for each survey wave. The survey relied on the willingness of study area residents to (1) provide demographic information about the household, its members, and its vehicles, (2) document all travel for each household member, aged 15 years or older, for an assigned 2-day period, and (3) agree to participate in additional survey waves. After an initial telephone screening, survey participants received mailed travel diaries to aid in documenting travel information for the 2-day assessment period. Respondents were instructed to record their mode of transportation, trip purpose, number of passengers, departure and arrival times, ride fare, and parking cost. Demographic information for this study includes age, gender, education, employment status, and household income."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The panel was undertaken to serve three basic objectives: (1) to be a metropolitan \"current population survey\" to track changes in employment, work characteristics, household composition, and vehicle availability; (2) to monitor changes in travel behavior and responses to changes in the transportation environment; and (3) to examine changes in attitudes and values as they affect mode choice and travel behavior. Information gained from the panel has aided long range transportation forecasting and analysis used in decisions regarding highway and road construction, transit development, and carpooling and parking policies."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For information on the study design of the Seattle Household Travel Survey Wave 9, 2000, please refer to the Original P.I.
