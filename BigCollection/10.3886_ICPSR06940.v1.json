With respect to modern biotechnology issues, respondents  were asked for their opinions regarding which organizations should  regulate modern biotechnology, and the likelihood that in the next 20  years biotechnology would lead to events such as reducing  environmental pollution and world hunger, creating dangerous new  diseases, solving more crimes through genetic fingerprinting, curing  genetic diseases, and producing designer babies. Computer network  privacy issues covered respondents' worries about leaving \"electronic  tracks\" of personal identifying information when using computer  network services and concerns about the use of information collected  from network services for advertising, or by shops, insurance  companies, or public bodies. Other data protection questions probed  for respondents' willingness to use new communication technologies and  electronic services considering that someone else might use their  personal information, awareness and concern about using a means of  payment on networks that might leave tracks, awareness of laws that  protect privacy, the importance of the EU trying to protect personal  information, and the importance of worldwide privacy of personal  information. Also covered were respondent interest in on-screen  computer or television network technologies and in the capabilities  these technologies provide, such as getting a medical opinion on a  health issue, an on-line guid\ned tour of a museum, receiving instant  access to newspapers, taking part in a training program, making it  easier to look for a job, taking part in discussion groups, receiving  and sending electronic mail, managing bank and financial accounts, and  organizing a trip. Common European currency items included whether  respondents were for or against one European currency in all member  states and why, how well-informed they felt about the common European  currency, their knowledge of the conditions member countries must meet  in order to join the European Economic and Monetary Union, when notes  and coins in the European currency would be introduced, their own  country's ability to take part in the Single European Currency in  1999, the consequences for not participating, and what the rate of  introduction should be for the common European currency. Questions  asked only in Sweden concerned attitudes toward expanding or reducing  nuclear power, the respondent's three favorite activities, and highest  level of education completed. Demographic items include age, gender,  marital status, household size, monthly income, age when stopped full-time education, and occupation."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"biotechnology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"currencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"euro"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Economic and Monetary Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"genetic engineering"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"privacy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"telecommunications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
