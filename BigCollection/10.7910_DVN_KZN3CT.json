We consider agricultural subsidies as a type of distributive policy that targets the agricultural sector at the expense of consumers and taxpayers. Based on Cox (1987, 1990) and Myerson (1993), we argue that electoral systems that encourage politicians to appeal to a narrow constituency tend to have a higher level of agricultural support. We test this theoretical hypothesis using OECD agricultural support data disaggregated by commodity and country. A cross-classified multilevel model is employed to account for complex variation of agricultural support across countries, commodities, and time. Our empirical results show that electoral systems that encourage politicians to target narrow (broad) constituencies are associated with relatively high (low) levels of agricultural subsidies.\""}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Park, J.H. & Jensen, N., 2007, Electoral competition and agricultural support in OECD countries, American Journal of Political Science, 51(2), pp. 314-29."}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Matthias Orlowski"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Humboldt-University"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-02-27"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1986"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2000"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Time-series cross-section"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, United States"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Countries"]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["OECD"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Original data set as provided by the authors","label":"park_and_jensen_ajps_2007_1.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":66879,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2360162,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"park_and_jensen_ajps_2007_1.txt","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":302821,"description":"Original data set as provided by the authors","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:81499","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6139dbfc8f67f02b03d0776d21013048","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6139dbfc8f67f02b03d0776d21013048"}}}]}}}
