Students from different social science fields replicated a paper in their field and learned about reproducibility standards. This year we included guest lectures on reproducibility tools, as you can see from the syllabus. Feel free to use these materials in your own teaching; I would be interested if they are of use to you.   I blog about the workshop and reproducibility here: http://politicalsciencereplication.wordpress.com/category/replication-workshop/.  I also published a paper \"Bringing the Gold Standard Into the Class Room: Replication in University Teaching\" which is based on the workshop's experiences, and it is forthcoming in International Studies Perspectives [it will appear online soon and is open access].  The syllabus, assingments and handouts from previous years are also available on this dataverse."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-09"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-09"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-09"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This .zip contains several separate pdfs with the weekly handouts and assignments.
