Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, New York State Governor George Pataki, Republican Senate candidate Rick Lazio, First Lady/Democratic Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and former State Senator Al D'Amato. Respondents were asked a series of questions regarding the current race for the United States Senate in New York and the presidential election. Issues addressed included respondents' feelings about abortion, whether vouchers should be issued to pay for private schooling, how best to deal with the budget surplus, and whether all guns should be registered with the state. Additionally, respondents were asked for their views on the nature of the Senate campaign, the importance of candidates' political experience, the relevance of a candid\nate being a naturalized New York citizen, and whether the current Senate campaign tactics were overly divisive.
