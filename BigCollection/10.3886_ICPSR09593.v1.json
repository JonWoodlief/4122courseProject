The purpose of the collection was to replicate the   benchmark study of occupational prestige conducted by Hodge, Siegel,   and Rossi (HSR) in 1964, while expanding the number of rated   occupations to include all 503 detailed occupational categories in the   1980 Census. Additional titles were added from the HSR study and   several other studies of occupational prestige, for a total of 704   occupational titles. Respondents were divided into 10 subsamples, with   each subsample rating 110 occupations. The first 40 titles presented to   each respondent were the same for all subsamples. As in the HSR study,   respondents were asked to rate the occupations on a scale of 1 to 9. To   promote comparability with the HSR study, both the nature of the task   respondents were asked to perform (ranking titles) and the wording of  the instructions were the same in both studies."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupational categories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupational status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prestige"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"socioeconomic status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVI.A.
