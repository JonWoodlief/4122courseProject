The surveys also focused on health problems.  Questions about smoking examined whether the respondent had heard of  the European Code Against Cancer and whether the respondent  smoked. Smokers were asked what tobacco products they used, how many  cigarettes they smoked in a day, and whether they planned to cut down  on their tobacco consumption. Queries focusing on other health issues  included respondents' subjective ratings of their health and diet, the  basis for their foodstuff selections, the extent and impact of alcohol  consumption on their driving, the extent of the problem of drinking  and driving, how the problem of drinking and driving would be best  addressed, and respondents' own use of al\ncohol. Opinions on alcohol  and drug abuse were elicited through questions such as what type of  problem the respondent considered alcohol and drug use to be, whether  current measures were enough to solve abuse, what measures should be  taken to solve the problems, the respondent's knowledge of drugs and  the use of drugs, drug use among acquaintances, and how drug testing  should be implemented. AIDS-related items focused on how the  respondent thought AIDS could be contracted and which manner of  transmission the respondent most feared, which interventions should be  used to eliminate or to slow the spread of AIDS, which interventions  should be undertaken by the European Community, how best to handle  those who had AIDS or were HIV-positive, whether the respondent  personally knew anyone with AIDS/HIV+, how the emergence and spread of  AIDS had changed the respondent's personal habits, and what  precautions were effective against contracting AIDS. Questions  concerning the respondent's work history asked whether there had been  periods without work lasting more than a year. A series of items  focused on the longest period without pay: how long the period was,  the age of the respondent during this period, the main reason for  leaving the previous job, what the previous occupation was and whether  it was part-time, what the new occupation was and whether it was  part-time, and how the level of the new occupation compared to the  previous occupation. The interaction of raising children and pursuing  a career was investigated through questions including how many  children the respondent had, what effect changes in family life had on  working life, whether the respondent worked full- or part-time while  raising children, and whether the respondent would prefer to care for  children full-time, care for children part-time and work part-time, or  work full-time. A series of questions pertained to the period prior to  the respondent's first three children attending school: whether the  respondent worked during this period, what the respondent's occupation  was, the attributes of the occupation that concerned the family, the  attributes of the partner's occupation that concerned the family, who  the primary caregivers were, whether the partner was the primary  caregiver, and whether there were difficulties making last-minute  arrangements for child care. Additional information was gathered on  family income, number of people residing in the home, size of  locality, home ownership, region of residence, occupation of the head  of household, and the respondent's age, sex, occupation, education,  religion, religiosity, subjective social class standing, political party and union membership, and left-right political self-placement."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AIDS"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol
