Data were\r\ncollected through house to house interview using household food insecurity access\r\nscale (HFIAS) which is structured and universally applicable household food\r\ninsecurity 9 item measurement tools. Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions\r\nwere used to determine prevalence of household food insecurity and its associated\r\nfactors.\r\nResult: - 60.8% of the rural households were found to be food insecure in the study\r\narea. Out of the total eleven variables included in the logistic regression analysis\r\nmodel only 6 variables namely; livestock ownership (AOR= 2.05, 95%CI = 1.039-\r\n4.022), use of fertilizer (AOR = 4.23, 95% CI = 1.741-10.275), source of potable\r\nwater (AOR = 4.00, 95% CI = 2.060-7.764), off-farm income (A0R = 2.90, 95% CI =\r\n1.249-6.712), annual farm income (AOR = 3.98, 95% CI = 2.514-6.303) and total\r\nannual income (AOR = 3.93, 95% CI = 2.471-6.258) were found to be statistically\r\nsignificant.\r\nConclusion and recommendation: - The majority (60.8%) of households in rural\r\ncommunities of Gondar City Administration is food insecure and factors like livestock\r\nownership, use of fertilizers, source of potable water, off-farm income, farm income\r\nand total annual income are found to be significantly associated with household food\r\ninsecurity in the study area. Thus, Government bodies, NGOs and the community at large should work cooperatively in areas that enable rural households to minimize\r\nthe problem of food insecurity by overcoming factors associated with it."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-11"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Ethiopia"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2/2014"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"dissertation"}]}},"files":[{"description":"May-August 2014 Issue (Vol 2, No 2/2014)","label":"Assessment of Household Food Insecurity and Associated Factors in Rural Communities of Gondar City Administration.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88789,"dataFile":{"id":2917428,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/NMBJAK/TLCTA5","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NMBJAK/TLCTA5","filename":"Assessment of Household Food Insecurity and Associated Factors in Rural Communities of Gondar City Administration.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1313548,"description":"May-August 2014 Issue (Vol 2, No 2/2014)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15854549aed-ef0504ce9bc8","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"17898ea871ebab42039a3c6697a1bf49","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"17898ea871ebab42039a3c6697a1bf49"}}}]}}}
