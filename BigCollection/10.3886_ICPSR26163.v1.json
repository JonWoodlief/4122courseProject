Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling his job as president, whether things in the country were going in the right direction, to rate the condition of the national economy, and what was the most important problem facing the country. Opinions were solicited on potential 2008 presidential candidates, how much attention respondents had been paying to the 2008 presidential election campaign, whether they voted in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus, which candidate they would like to see nominated as the 2008 Democratic presidential candidate, and which candidate they would vote for if the 2008 presidential election were being held that day. Respondents were also asked whether they would like to see Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama pick the other as their vice presidential running mate, whether the length of the Democratic nomination race would help the Democrats in November, whether there should be a single national primary election day, whether John McCain would continue George W. Bush's policies if elected, and respondents opinions about the way the news media had been treating the potential 2008 presidential candidates. A series of questions were asked about race and gender in politics, including how much of a factor a candidate's race or gender was in determining respondents' votes, whether America was ready to vote for an African American or a woman president, whether a sufficient number of women and African Americans held high level political positions, and whether Barack Obama's and Hillary Clinton's candidacies made it easier for other African Americans and women to run for president in the future. Additional questions asked about Bill Clinton's involvement in Hillary Clinton's campaign, gay marriage, the Iraq War, the price of gasoline, and personal finances. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, education level, household income, marital status, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, and voter registration status and participation
