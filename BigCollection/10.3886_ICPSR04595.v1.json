CPSC began  operating NEISS in 1972 to monitor product-related injuries treated in  United States hospital emergency departments (EDs). In June 1992, the  National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), within the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, established an interagency  agreement with CPSC to begin collecting data on nonfatal  firearm-related injuries in order to monitor the incidents and the  characteristics of persons with nonfatal firearm-related injuries  treated in United States hospital EDs over time. This dataset  represents all nonfatal firearm-related injuries (i.e., injuries  associated with powder-charged guns) and all nonfatal BB and pellet  gun-related injuries reported through NEISS from 1993 through  2004. The cases consist of initial ED visits for treatment of the  injuries. Cases were reported even if the patients subsequently died.  Secondary visits and transfers from other hospitals were excluded.  Information is available on injury diagnosis, firearm type, use of  drugs or alcohol, criminal incident, and locale of the  incident. Demographic information includes age, sex, and race of the injured person."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"accidents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"firearms"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"handguns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nonfatal injuries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"product safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

There were four hospital-sized  strata (defined as very large, large, medium, and small, based on the  number of annual ED visits) and one children's hospital stratum. From  1993 through 1996, there were 91 NEISS hospital EDs in the sample. In  1997, the sampling frame was updated so that in 1997 through 1999, the  sample included 101 NEISS hospital EDs. In 2000-2001, one NEISS  hospital dropped out of the system, so there were 100 NEISS hospital  EDs in the sample. In 2002, another hospital dropped out of the  system, so there were 99 NEISS hospital EDs in the sampling frame. In  1997, CPSC collected firearm-related cases using the \"old\" and \"new\"  NEISS hospital samples for a nine-month period. This dataset includes  data from the \"new\" sample. The overlapping \"old\" sample is not  included. Comparisons of weighted estimates based on the \"old\" and  \"new\" samples indicated a difference of about 1 percent in the overall  national\nestimate using these samples. The characteristics of  firearm-related cases from these two overlapping samples were also very similar."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Firearm Injury Surveillance Study, 1993-2004 [United States]","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37565,"dataFile":{"id":2628410,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Firearm Injury Surveillance Study, 1993-2004 [United States]","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
