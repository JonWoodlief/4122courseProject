Residents of the state of New Jersey were asked to give their opinions of candidates Jim McGreevey (Democrat) and Bret Schundler (Republican), as well as their opinions of President George W. Bush, New Jersey acting governor Donald DiFrancesco, New Jersey senators Jon Corzine and Robert Torricelli, and former New Jersey governor Christie Whitman. Respondents were also queried about their readiness to vote in the upcoming election, whom they were going to vote for, and who, in their opinion, would become governor. Respondents answered a set of questions comparing McGreevey and Schundler as gubernatorial candidates in terms of their experience, interest in people like themselves, integrity, temperament, leadership qualities, and political philosophy, as well as who would deal better with the economy, property taxes, crime, and education in New Jersey. The survey also elicited respondents' feelings about the recent terrorist attacks. Respondents were asked whether their daily routine had returned to normal, whether they were personally concerned about terrorist attacks in their community and/or another terrorist attack against New York City, whether they had experienced negative feelings toward Arab Americans, Muslims, and/or immigrants from the Middle East, whether anyone close to them was missing, injured, or killed in the attacks, whether they had experienced job and/or financial loss as a result of the attacks, and whether they were concerned about possible exposure to anthrax. Additional questions probed respondents' views on issues such as abortion, racial profiling, school vouchers, automobile insurance deregulation, laws restricting the sale of handguns, and how to balance the budget in New Jersey. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, employment status, marital status, religion, education, race, Hispanic descent, children in household, whether children attended private or public school, gun ownership, automobile ownership, urban vs. rural residence, years at current residence, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gubernatorial elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"September 11 attack"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist attacks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist threat"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
