Respondents were further asked  whether they thought Barry Bonds had utilized steroids or  performance-enhancing drugs and whether that would have an impact on  how they felt about him potentially breaking baseball's homerun  record. Questions were also solicited regarding the possibility of  Barry Bonds being elected to the Hall of Fame and whether the use of  steroids or a conviction of tax evasion should prevent him from being  selected.
