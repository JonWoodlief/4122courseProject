The predominant belief is that policy emulation occurs because decision makers defer to other states possessing certain similarities with their state. This shorthand policy learning does not require observation of policy outcomes. Nonetheless, the results of this paper suggest that states are more likely to adopt policing policies of other states if they are perceived to be successful in reducing the number of violent crimes performed compared to years past."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policy diffusion, policy emulation, policy learning, policing innovation, state bureaucracy"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Article: \"The role of perceived policy success in the diffusion of criminal policing policy innovations.\" International Journal of Innovation and Learning. 11 (2): 136-161.
