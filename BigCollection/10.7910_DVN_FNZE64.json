A fundamental obstacle to progress in this pursuit is the lack of direct measures of policy output, especially for the period prior to 1946. The lack of direct measures of legislative accomplishment makes it difficult to assess the performance of our political sy\nstem. We provide a new measure of legislative significance and accomplishment. Specifically, we demonstrate how item response theory can be combined with a new dataset that contains every public statute enacted between 1877 and 1994 to estimate \"legislative importance\" across time. Although the resulting estimates provide a new opportunity for scholars interested in analyzing policymaking in the U.S. since 1877, the methodology we present is not restricted to Congress, the U.S., or lawmaking."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Joshua D.
