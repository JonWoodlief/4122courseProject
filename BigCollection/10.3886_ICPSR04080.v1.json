The TSAV was a federal-tribal partnership, lasting  from 1995 to 1999, designed to develop comprehensive strategies in  tribal communities to reduce crime, violence, and substance abuse.  This study involved four of the seven TSAV sites: the Chickasaw Nation  in Oklahoma, Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes in Montana, the  Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in Michigan, and  the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. A survey  of TSAV stakeholders at the four sites was conducted in the summer and  fall of 1999. The objectives of the survey were to gauge TSAV  stakeholders' perceptions about the following: (1) the serious crime,  violence, and quality of life issues in each community and the extent  to which the local TSAV initiative had addressed those issues, (2) the  intent and ultimate outcomes of the TSAV program, (3) obstacles to  successful implementation of TSAV activities, and (4) decision-making  processes used in planning and implementing TSAV locally.

Designed by the United States  Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance, the TSAV was a  federal-tribal partnership designed to develop comprehensive  strategies in tribal communities to reduce crime, violence, and  substance abuse. The TSAV initiative had three official objectives:  (1) improve communities' ability to comprehensively address issues of  crime, violence, and drugs, (2) promote community-based program  development involving the active participation of youth, community  residents, educators, spiritual leaders, businesses, social services,  criminal justice representatives, and elected officials, and (3)  develop an effective culturally sensitive program model that can be  replicated by other Native American Communities. Each of the seven  sites that received TSAV funding developed a specific set of goals to  further these overall objectives. Each site had a core team that  consisted of approximately five people who held formal planning and  oversight responsibility for the local TSAV initiative. This study  involved four of the seven TSAV sites: the Chickasaw Nation in  Oklahoma, Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes in Montana, the Grand  Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians in Michigan, and the  Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. TSAV funding  was awarded to the Fort Peck tribes in 1995 and to the other three  sites in 1996. For all four sites TSAV funding lasted through August  1999. This evaluation had the following goals: (1) document how TSAV  approaches had evolved at each of the four TSAV sites, (2) document  how each site had implemented its comprehensive strategies, (3)  analyze and report how differences in local cultures, physical  environments, or government structures at the sites may have affected  implementation at the sites and may or may not have implications for  the potential success of TSAV in other Amer\nican Indian communities,  and (4) provide useful evaluation findings for tribal and United  States Department of Justice (DOJ) decision-makers and other criminal justice stakeholders."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1 contains data from a survey of TSAV  stakeholders at all four study sites that was conducted in the summer  and fall of 1999. The survey used a questionnaire consisting of 207  items addressing 16 topic areas. The objectives of the survey were to  gauge TSAV stakeholders' perceptions about the success of TSAV  initiatives and the remaining crime, violence, and quality of life  issues in each community. The questionnaire was adapted from one used  by the Comprehensive Communities Program, another Bureau of Justice  Assistance initiative. Part 2 contains data on crimes committed at the  Fort Peck site. These data were collected for the fiscal year 1995  through the fiscal year 1998 from the tribal court, which had  facilities in the towns of Wolf Point and Poplar, and from the Wolf  Point Police, a city police force that operated within the Fort Peck  Reservation's boundaries. Offense data for 1999 were not obtained  because they were not available at the time the site was visited in  October 1999. Wolf Point Police Department data overlap with the  tribal court data because from 51 percent (in 1995) to 67 percent (in  1996) of the Wolf Point cases were referred to the tribal court. Part  3 contains data on crimes committed at the Grand Traverse Band site  for the fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999. These data were collected  from the Grand Traverse Band's police department. Crime data were not  available for the Turtle Mountain or Chickasaw Nation sites. The data  were provided to ICPSR as Microsoft Excel files.
