The study attempted to find data that captured the various push factors in each source country that would help quantify the risk associated with a particular country.

The age-specific risk (population data in each of the eight countries of origin are available for 5-year age groups, or 17 age groups in all) is modeled with a Weibull probability distribution (see Appendix A of the final report: Clawson, Layne, and Small, 2006; NCJ 215475), which is specified differently for males and females.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<ul>\n<li>The Country-Specific Risk Indices for Females Data (Part 1) include a total of 12 variables.
