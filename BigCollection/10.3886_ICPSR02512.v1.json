Respondents were asked whether they believed that Clinton had forced   himself sexually on Willey, and whether it was his private business   or a public matter. A series of questions addressed the allegations   of sexual misconduct facing Clinton in general. Topics covered the   alleged affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,   whether Clinton had lied under oath when questioned about the   scandals, whether he had demonstrated a pattern of sexual misconduct,   and the possible punishments that might be imposed upon Clinton if he   were found guilty of any wrongdoing. Respondents were also queried as   to which allegation was more serious, that Clinton forced himself   sexually on Willey or that he had an affair with Lewinsky.
