The purpose of this study is to explore citizen attitudes regarding blame of intelligence officials for making America vulnerable to the attacks on 9/11. The study used a short Internet-based survey experiment to test whether party cues affect people’s attitudes about the responsibility of three government officials in making America vulnerable to the 9/11 attacks: CIA Director George Tenet, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. The survey was conducted by Knowledge Networks (KN) over the Internet in February 2007, using a nationally representative sample of 1015 American adults. KN recruits panel members over the telephone via random digit dialing (RDD) and provides them with WebTV equipment in exchange for their participation in weekly surveys, which they complete online. All Americans were sampled from the KN panel. Variables for this study can be divided into two general categories: demographic and feelings over 9/11. The feelings variables question the respondent about personal emotion connected to 9/11 and how much blame the respondent places on George Tenet, Louis Freeh, and Alan Greenspan. Finally, respondents were asked about the blame to place on additional federal, state, and local authorities."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ideologies"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preparedness"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist

KN recruits panel members over the telephone via random digit dialing (RDD) and provides them with WebTV equipment in exchange for their participation in weekly surveys, which they complete online. All Americans were sampled from the KN panel. The experiment consisted of three manipulations, one for each of the three officials. In each manipulation, respondents were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. In Condition 1, the official was designated as a “Republican appointee.” In Condition 2, the official was designated as a “Democratic appointee.” In Condition 3, which serves as the control group, no designation was provided. Since each of these officials was appointed by both a Republican and Democratic president, the information presented to respondents is correct, but provides differing party cues."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"web-based interview"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Seven post-stratification weights are incorporated into this study. The first is half-sampling of telephone numbers for which no address could be found. The second is RDD sampling rates proportional to the number of phone lines in the household. The third is minor oversampling of Chicago and Los Angeles due to early pilot surveys in these two cities. The fourth is short-term double-sampling of the four largest states (CA, NY, FL, and TX) and central region states. The fifth is under-sampling of households not covered by MSN TV. The sixth is oversampling of minority households (Black and Hispanic). Finally, the seventh weight is the selection of one adult per household. In order to calculate final weights, the researchers derived weighted sample distributions along various combinations of five variables. The first is gender (male, female). The second is age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 and over). The third is race/ethnicity (White, Black, other, Hispanic). The fourth is region (northeast, Midwest, south, west). Finally, the fifth variable is education (highest level achieved: less than high school, high school, some college, college degree or more). Similar distributions are calculated using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data and the Knowledge Network panel data. Cell-by-cell adjustments over the various univariate and bivariate distributions are calculated to make the weighted sample cells match those of the U.S. Census and the Knowledge Network panel."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"9-11_Blame_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43269,"dataFile":{"id":2300957,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"9-11_Blame_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":282561,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69761","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"94df4f6f4a106836327f16ca6118fc86","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"94df4f6f4a106836327f16ca6118fc86"}}},{"description":"","label":"9-11_Blame_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43269,"dataFile":{"id":2300958,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"9-11_Blame_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":172906,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69762","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:x2jTjT4FpTwqU55Cuw3Cgg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"244571194252e3a29596cac85e750335","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"244571194252e3a29596cac85e750335"}}}]}}}
