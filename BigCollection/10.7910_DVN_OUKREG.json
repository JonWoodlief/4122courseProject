Adjusted OR of serum lactate calculated from multivariable analysis was 1.09 (p < 0.001; 95% CI, 1.07 - 1.10). The area under a ROC curve (AUC) of serum lactate was 0.711 (p < 0.001; 95% CI, 0.703 - 0.718). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the cutoff > 2.6 mmol/L were 56.7%, 74.3%, 20.8%, and 93.5%, respectively. Mortality of the high-lactate group (> 2.6 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of the low lactate group (â‰¤ 2.6 mmol/L) (20.8% vs. 6.5%, difference = 14.3%, p < 0.01; 95% CI, 13.0% - 15.7%).\r\nConclusion: A serum lactate level > 2.6 mmol/L predicted 30 day in-hospital mortality in unselected patients who arrived to the ED and were admitted to the hospital.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-11-23"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Kim, Dong Hoon"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-11-23"}]}},"files":[{"label":"lactate study_HARVARD.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":130846,"dataFile":{"id":3082146,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OUKREG/DC1PNY","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OUKREG/DC1PNY","filename":"lactate study_HARVARD.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":28047394,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15fe7d0f36d-8e55cb456ef0","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5b7faa70094a56e8c90c588f632d1ad2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5b7faa70094a56e8c90c588f632d1ad2"}}}]}}}
