Part 1 is the result of a nationwide mail survey of Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC). Questions centered on the delivery of mental health services to the elderly, and cover topics such as the number of elderly people in the client load, amount of interaction between CMHC and Area Agencies on Aging (AAA), factors affecting the delivery of services to the elderly, and specialized services for the elderly. In addition to data from the PRAMHS questionnaire, d\nata from the 1976 National Institute of Mental Health CMHC inventory were merged with the corresponding agencies. Part 2 contains data from a mail survey of Area Agencies on Aging. Data include percentage of referrals made by agencies to mental health programs as compared to other types of programs, priority given to mental health issues, factors influencing delivery and coordination of mental health services to the elderly, and amount of communication between AAA and agencies in its service are\na serving the mental health needs of the elderly. Part 3 consists of data collected by the PRAMHS project State Unit on Aging (SUA) mail survey. Information is included on interaction with State Mental Health Agencies, priority given to mental health issues, efforts by the elderly to influence policy decisions, and factors influencing delivery and coordination of mental health services to the elderly. Part 4 contains the result of the PRAMHS State Mental Health Agencies mail survey. Data provide\ninformation concerning interaction with SUA, efforts to decrease the\nnumber of elderly in state mental health institutions, efforts by the\nelderly to influence policy decisions, and factors influencing delivery and coordination of mental health services to the elderly."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"aging"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health facilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hospitals"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"senior citizens"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.D.
