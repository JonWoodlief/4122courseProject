In each city, two surveys were conducted: A conventional random sample of musicians belonging to the American Federation of Musicians and a \"respondent-driven sample\"  of jazz musicians. The American Federation of Musicians Survey collected data from 1,963 American Federation of Musicians members.  Interviews were conducted by phone between March 13 and May 23, 2001, using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system.  For the Respondent-Driven Sample Survey, in-person interviews were completed with a total of 733 jazz musicians during the spring and summer of 2001."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"n/a"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>For the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Survey, respondents were sent a letter explaining the purpose of the survey prior to being called. A pilot test of the survey was conducted with 25 musicians during March 5, 2001 through March 9, 2001. A random sample of about 15 percent of the membership of the AFM locals was selected in each of the four metropolitan areas included in the study.  Participating locals were Detroit local 5, New Orleans local 174-496, New York local 802, and San Francisco local 6.  A total of 1,963 interviews were completed -- 938 in New York, 348 in San Francisco, 284 in New Orleans, and 393 in Detroit.  Of these, 1,532 respondents were classified as \"jazz musicians\" based on having answered \"yes\" to the question, \"Do you ever play or sing jazz music?\" Interviews were conducted by phone between March 13 and May 23, 2001, using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. Because the AFM cannot break out jazz musicians from their membership and in order to compare the results of jazz musicians' comments to those of other musicians, the random sample included all types of musicians.</p>\n\n<p>For the Respondent Driven Survey, a total of 1,200 jazz musicians were interviewed. Interviews ranged from 20 minutes to two hours long. A peer recruitment sampling strategy, known as respondent-driven sampling (RDS), was employed to locate eligible respondents for the RDS study. Created by Cornell University sociologist Douglas Heckathorn, RDS was developed to overcome the biases traditionally associated with chain-referral sampling. (A detailed description of the theory and mathematical underpinnings of\nthis sampling method may be found in the article, \"Finding the beat: Using respondent-driven sampling to study jazz musicians,\" by Douglas D. Heckathorn and Joan Jeffri [Poetics 28 (2001) 307-329].) In-person interviews were completed with a total of 733 jazz musicians during the spring and summer of 2001 -- 264 in New York, 300 in San Francisco, 110 in New Orleans, and 59 in Detroit. By using respondent-driven sampling, initially selected jazz musicians referred other jazz musicians to the interviewer. The RDS component was necessary because many jazz musicians do not belong to the AFM union or other institutions that could be used to locate and identify them. In addition, jazz musicians tend to have many social networks with other jazz musicians, making RDS particularly appropriate in tapping this hidden population. Due to the small size of the Detroit sample (59 cases), these cases are not included in the data set.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"artist employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"artist unions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"artists"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arts participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"music"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"musicians"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"performing arts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"wages and salaries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.
