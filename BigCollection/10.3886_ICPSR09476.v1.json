The focus (unit of analysis) was on the organized groups rather   than their individual members. The project assessed the needs of these   g\nroups in pursuing their goals and considered the operations used to   implement or carry out their activities. The data collected address   some of the following issues: (1) Are business operations (including   daily operations, acquiring ownership, and structuring the   organization) of organized criminal groups conducted in a manner   paralleling legitimate business ventures? (2) Should investigating and   prosecuting white-collar crime be a central way of proceeding against   organized criminal groups? (3) What are the characteristics of the   illegal activities of organized criminal groups? (4) In what ways are   legal activities used by organized criminal groups to pursue income   from illegal activities? (5) What is the purpose of involvement in   legal activities for organized criminal groups? (6) What services are   used by organized criminal groups to implement their activities?   Variables include information on the offense actually charged against   the criminal organization in the indictments or complaints, other   illegal activities participated in by the organization, and the   judgments against the organization requested by law enforcement   agencies. These judgments fall into several categories: monetary relief   (such as payment of costs of investigation and recovery of stolen or   misappropriated funds), equitable relief (such as placing the business   in receivership or establishment of a victim fund), restraints on   actions (such as prohibiting participation in labor union activities or   further criminal involvement), and forfeitures (such as forfeiting   assets in pension funds or bank accounts). Other variables include the   organization's participation in business-type activities--both illegal   and legal, the organization's purpose for providing legal goods and   services, the objectives of the organization, the market for the   illegal goods and services provided by the organization, the   organization's assets, the business services it requires, how it   financially provides for its members, the methods it uses to acquire  ownership, indicators of its ownership, and the nature of its victims."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career criminals"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement agencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"organized crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"white collar crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
