The data addressed the  following questions: (1) To what extent does arrest decrease the  likelihood of continued violence, as assessed by the victim? (2) To  what extent does arrest decrease the likelihood of continued  complaints of crime, as assessed by police records? (3) What are the  differences in arrest recidivism between cases that involved arrest  versus cases that involved mediation, separation, warrant issued, or  no warrant issued? Domestic violence cases in three sectors of Omaha,  Nebraska, meeting established eligibility criteria, were assigned to  one of five experimental treatments: mediation, separation, arrest,  warrant issued, or no warrant issued. Data for victim reports were  collected from three interviews with the victims conducted one week,  six months, and 12 months after the domestic violence incident.  Arrest, charge, and complaint data were collected on the suspects at  six- and twelve-month intervals following the original domestic  violence incident. The investigators used arrest recidivism, continued  complaints of crime, and victim reports of repeated violence (fear of  injury, pushing/hitting, and physical injury) as outcome measures to  assess the extent to which treatments prevented subsequent conflicts.  Other variables include victim's level of fear, self-esteem, locus of  control, and welfare dependency, changes in the relationship between  suspect and victim, extent of the victim's injury, and extent of drug  use by the victim and the suspect.
