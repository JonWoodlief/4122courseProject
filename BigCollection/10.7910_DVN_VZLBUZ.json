In order to establish whether a horizontal (left-right) and vertical (top-down) consensus exists on foreign policy, special attention has been paid to divergence and convergence patterns in terms of threat perception, feelings towards the (American and European) allies, support for the main institutional mechanisms of coordination and cooperation, and willingness to use military power to defend the constituted order and the national interest, while controlling for the position and level of action of each actor within the foreign policy-making process as well as her or his ideological orientation. While tracing elites’ and publics’ attitudes towards a wide range of foreign policy and security issues, the article reveals the effect of ideological and situational factors on the strategic preferences of national policy-makers and public opinion. In doing this, it contributes to define both the substance and boundaries of the alleged consensus, based on shared norms and historical legacies, supposedly overcoming socio-economic and political cleavages in matters of foreign policy."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-03-08"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Italian foreign policy"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Political elites"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Governmental elites"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Organised public"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Public opinion"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Olmastroni, Francesco"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-03-08"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Syntax file","label":"Olmastroni (2017) - AllegedConsensus.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124567,"dataFile":{"id":3005362,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/4BPUAH","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/4BPUAH","filename":"Olmastroni (2017) - AllegedConsensus.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":27492,"description":"Syntax file","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15aae89d2e8-4f079b0949bf","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b99241530c240a92c9f047a104f19062","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b99241530c240a92c9f047a104f19062"}}},{"description":"Dataset","label":"Olmastroni (2017) - AllegedConsensus.dta","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124567,"dataFile":{"id":3005364,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/PY5529","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/PY5529","filename":"Olmastroni (2017) - AllegedConsensus.dta","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":277112,"description":"Dataset","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15aae8a2a2a-ad2f5be0b4cd","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"071289d7316033985557ea802cd405c2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"071289d7316033985557ea802cd405c2"}}},{"description":"Questionnaire (elite version)","label":"Questionario_PRIN-PEI_FIELD_ELITE.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124567,"dataFile":{"id":3005365,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/JWKZJA","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/JWKZJA","filename":"Questionario_PRIN-PEI_FIELD_ELITE.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":212276,"description":"Questionnaire (elite version)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15aae8cb152-9f5d46c2934c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7688b994b89152965873ae2ecb174f04","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7688b994b89152965873ae2ecb174f04"}}},{"description":"Questionnaire (mass public version)","label":"Questionario_PRIN-PEI_FIELD_MASSE.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124567,"dataFile":{"id":3005363,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/IWPGSZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VZLBUZ/IWPGSZ","filename":"Questionario_PRIN-PEI_FIELD_MASSE.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":188140,"description":"Questionnaire (mass public version)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15aae8cbfb1-641720af8a75","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d698a63410f60dcb81fedc7dd118eb78","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d698a63410f60dcb81fedc7dd118eb78"}}}]}}}
