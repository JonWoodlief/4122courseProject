Residents of the state of Florida  were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his  handling of the presidency and the situation in the Middle East, as  well as their views on Florida governor Jeb Bush, Vice President Al  Gore, Texas governor George W. Bush, Connecticut senator Joseph  Lieberman, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, and Florida  senatorial candidates Bill Nelson, Bill McCollum, and Willie  Randolph. Those queried were asked whether they intended to vote in  the November 7, 2000, elections, and for whom they would vote if the  presidential election were held that day, given a choice among Gore  (Democratic Party), Bush (Republican Party), conservative commentator  Pat Buchanan (Reform Party), and consumer advocate Ralph Nader (Green  Party), as well as for whom they would vote if the election for United  States senator were held that day, given a choice among Nelson  (Democratic Party), McCollum (Republican Party), and Randolph  (Independent Party). A series of questions addressed the presidential  campaigns of Gore and Bush, including which candidate cared about the  needs of people like the respondent and had spent more time explaining  his proposals than attacking his opposition. Views on the candidates'  proposed policies were also elicited, including which candidate was  more likely to reduce the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly,  reduce taxes, make health care affordable for everyone, preserve  Social Security, and protect the environment. A series of questions  addressed the state of the nation, with items on the direction the  country was headed, the most important problems facing the federal  government, the state of the United States economy, and whether the  anticipated budget surplus should be used to reduce income taxes, pay  down the national debt, or preserve Social Security/Medicare. Other  questions focused on the presidential campaign, including respondents'  interest level in the campaign, why they supported their candidate,  who they thought would actually win the election, and the influence  that a candidate's stance on reducing prescription drug costs for the  elderly and preserving Social Security had on their decision-making.  Respondents' views were also sought on the proposed plans to allow  individuals to invest portions of their Social Security taxes in the  stock market, the April return of Elian Gonzalez to his father in  Cuba, the reestablishment of diplomatic trade relations with Cuba, and  whether the fact that Jeb Bush was George W.'s brother made the  respondent more or less likely to vote for him. Background  information on respondents includes age, gender, political party,  political orientation, race, Hispanic descent, marital status,  education, voter registration and participation history, religion,  Cuban descent, stock ownership, children in household, years in community, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, Jeb"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cheney, Dick"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gore, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lieberman, Joe"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Middle East"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Nader, Ralph"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prescription drugs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential campaigns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"taxes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
