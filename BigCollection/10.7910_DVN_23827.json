Three clinics were operated by community based organizations (CBOs) and one by a non-governmental organization (NGO), implementing HIV prevention programmes for high-risk MSM (HR-MSM) and transgenders (TG). The programmes provide a package of HIV prevention services including peer-led outreach education, promotion and distribution of condoms and lubricants, STI clinical services, community participation and enabling structural interventions. HR-MSM/TG avail clinic services either for treatment of STI-related symptoms or regular STI check-ups at quarterly intervals in the absence of symptoms. Additionally, the Mumbai clinics provide voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) for HIV and therefore include VCT clients. MSM clinic attendees were eligible for this study if they were; age 18 years or more, reported sex with at least two male partners in the last month and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the consultation. Peer educators created awareness and encouraged eligible MSM to attend the clinic and participate in the study. All MSM who attended the study clinics between October 2008 and May 2009 were screened for eligibility, and were administered informed consent. Total samples of 512 HR-MSM were collected for the study. Transportation cost to attend the clinic was covered. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review ethical committees of the National AIDS Research Institute of India (NARI), and the FHI 360 Protection of Human Subjects Committee in the USA."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured Questionnaire"}]}},"files":[{"description":"STI-OR MSM data (By FHI360)","label":"final stior msm data FHI360_26 feb 2013_dataverse.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131393,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2451295,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/23827/1HLFZM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/23827/1HLFZM","filename":"final stior msm data FHI360_26 feb 2013_dataverse.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":1140144,"description":"STI-OR MSM data (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:169700","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:8BAgjh8xzoU84xPw81PnKA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5ecd9233bd456a628d43ad9129173ff5","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5ecd9233bd456a628d43ad9129173ff5"}}},{"description":"Questionnaire (Form-3A: BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONNAIRE (BASELINE & ENDLINE)) for MSM, STI-OR study (By FHI360)","label":"MSM Form-3A.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131393,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2451297,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/23827/DTHWMA","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/23827/DTHWMA","filename":"MSM Form-3A.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":443263,"description":"Questionnaire (Form-3A: BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONNAIRE (BASELINE & ENDLINE)) for MSM, STI-OR study (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:169701","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9cb2c7fd0b6c72f5eb41ea356c7cee6b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9cb2c7fd0b6c72f5eb41ea356c7cee6b"}}},{"description":"Questionnaire (Form-3B: CLINICAL EXAMINATION) for MSM, STI-OR study (By FHI360)","label":"MSM Form 3B.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131393,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2451296,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/23827/GXF53X","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/23827/GXF53X","filename":"MSM Form 3B.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":216343,"description":"Questionnaire (Form-3B: CLINICAL EXAMINATION) for MSM, STI-OR study (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:169702","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"16de2107458a29b48bea618ec7163cc1","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"16de2107458a29b48bea618ec7163cc1"}}},{"description":"STI-OR MSM Data Dictionary (By FHI360)","label":"stior msm data dictionary FHI360_28 feb 2013_dataverse.xls","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131393,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2451298,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/23827/JYGVRF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/23827/JYGVRF","filename":"stior msm data dictionary FHI360_28 feb 2013_dataverse.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":107520,"description":"STI-OR MSM Data Dictionary (By FHI360)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:169703","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d1c4281daab41f9b1f2b18289ee77567","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d1c4281daab41f9b1f2b18289ee77567"}}}]}}}
