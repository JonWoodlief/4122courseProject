Economic policy uncertainty raises questions about the current and\r\nprospective characteristics of government policy about the economy. The potentially\r\nnegative implications of economic policy uncertainty on the financial security and\r\nwell-being of citizens should encourage risk-averse decision-making. An increase in\r\neconomic policy uncertainty then should compel many members of the public to\r\nconsider the potential costs involved in experiencing unintended pregnancies and/or\r\nsexually transmitted infections. As a result, the proposal of this project is that an\r\nincrease in economic policy uncertainty results in an increase in the search for information on the Internet about condoms. The empirical analyses conduct vector\r\nautoregression and moving average representation time series analyses of monthly\r\ninformation spanning between 2004 and 2013 about the economic policy uncertainty\r\nindex developed by Baker, Bloom & Davis (2013), and the volume of Internet search\r\ninterest reported by Google Trends about condoms. The results provide evidence\r\nthat prior change in economic policy uncertainty predicts the current search interest\r\nlevel about condoms, such that higher economic policy uncertainty increases search\r\ninterest about condoms. While prior research has focused on the behaviors of business firms when exploring the consequences of economic policy uncertainty, the research findings seen here give an indication that economic policy uncertainty can also have a role in the decision-making process of the mass public regarding personal health choices."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"condoms, Internet search interest, health information search, macroeconomics, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, risk-aversion, United States, Google Trends"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Article: \"Does economic policy uncertainty increase information search about condoms on the Internet?\" American Journal of Medical Research. 1 (2): 7-30."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Olds, Christopher"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-08-11"}]}},"files":[{"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses contrasting economic policy uncertainty and Internet search interest in the United States about condoms.","label":"OldsEconPolUncertaintyCondomSearchCommands.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":76211,"dataFile":{"id":2698917,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/DLNYQ1/QVIJ3Q","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DLNYQ1/QVIJ3Q","filename":"OldsEconPolUncertaintyCondomSearchCommands.txt","contentType":"text/plain","filesize":11468,"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses contrasting economic policy uncertainty and Internet search interest in the United States about condoms.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14f1c2e9127-38e1425ef345","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"95b8ff6754f61105865515fe1d25d43e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"95b8ff6754f61105865515fe1d25d43e"}}},{"description":"Monthly information on economic policy uncertainty from Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013), as well as Google search interest trends about condoms.
