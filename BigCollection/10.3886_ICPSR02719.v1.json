Through a telephone survey, respondents were asked a series of   questions about their awareness of, access to, understanding of, and   usage of computers, electronic mail, the Internet, and online   services. Those queried were asked whether their contact with this   technology was limited or extensive and for work or personal use,   whether computers and the Internet create or solve problems, whether   the Internet brings people together or isolates them, and whether   news and information obtained through the Internet is reliable. A   series of questions sought respondents' experiences using the   Internet to obtain the latest financial and sports news, product   information, travel informati\non, and entertainment information, to   purchase products or travel tickets, to make hotel reservations, and   to watch shows, play games, and visit adult entertainment sites.   Respondents were asked about their knowledge of and experiences with   the websites and online services of ESPN, Barnes and Noble, E-bay,   Merrill Lynch, Amazon.com, E-trade, CBS.Marketwatch.com, AOL.com,   Sportsline, Yahoo, CNN-F-N, and C-NET. Those queried were asked a   series of questions about stock market investments and the Internet,   including whether they had bought or traded stocks through the   Internet, the speed of those transactions, and how frequently they   checked their investments through online services. A series of   questions addressed the use of electronic mail (e-mail), including   frequency of use, whether email makes keeping in touch with others   easier, whether the respondent had communicated through this media   with someone they had never met in person and, for those not   currently using the service, whether they felt left out. Further   questions focused on respondents' computer skills, including the age   at which the respondent first encountered computers and the Internet,   their comfort level with this technology, and whether the lack or   presence of computer skills had ever aided them in, or prevented them   from, obtaining a job. Additional topics covered the importance of   the Internet to school-age children, whether the Internet plays a   major role in their daily activities, the presence of advertising on   websites, and concern over the theft of personal information, child   access to inappropriate information on the Internet, and the Y2K bug.   The results of this survey were announced on the CBS website   CBS.Marketwatch.com. Background information on respondents includes   age, race, sex, education, religion, marital status, employment   status, Hispanic origin, political party, political orientation,   voter registration and participation history, age of children in   household, family income, Internet and computer access, and measures  taken to prevent child access to inappropriate Internet sites."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
