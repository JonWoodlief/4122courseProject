In most cases, Frisch, Kelly, or both  traveled to archives to collect the textual materials from which the  data were generated. In most cases, the request data come from the  committee request summaries (briefing books) compiled for the  Democratic Members of the Committee on Ways and Means, the Democratic  Steering and Policy Committee, and the Republican Executive Committee  on Committees. In addition to Committee notebooks, copies of the  letters that individual members wrote in support of their assignment  requests were collected. The format of these letters typically  consists of a lengthy justification of the member's qualifications and  need for his or her first request, with perhaps a paragraph devoted to  a list of additional committees to which assignment would be  acceptable. In a few instances, when no briefing book was available,  preferences were reconstructed from the request letters submitted by  the members to their party committees. In these cases, the most recent  letter was considered the definitive statement of the member's  preferences. Data regarding subcommittee assignments are not included  in these data, nor are temporary committee assignments, nor are  assignments that were not made at the beginning of a Congressional  term. Committee requests for temporary, joint committees, boards,  select committees and the like are also not included. The total number  of committee preference listings is 2,480. Included are the committee  preferences of 1,163 first-term members, as well as committee transfer  requests made by 1,317 incumbents. For Democrats, the data cover the  80th through the 103rd Congress (but not the 85th Congress, which has  not been located), comprising the committee preferences of 1,366  members, 655 first-term Democrats, and 711 incumbent Democrats. For  the Republicans, the data cover the 86th through the 102nd Congress,  reflecting the committee preferences of 1,114 Republican members,  including 452 first-term Republicans and 662 incumbent Republicans.  Republican data prior to the 86th Congress could not be located and  were apparently lost during an effort to consolidate the records of  congressional leaders prior to the 86th Congress. Data for Republicans from the 103rd Congress have not been located."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional committees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"house committees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Republican Party (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Democratic Party (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States House of Representatives"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Senate"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DATAPASS I.
