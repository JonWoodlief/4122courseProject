A policy domain is a   set of organizations, both\ngovernmental and in the private sector,   operating at the federal level and seeking to influence the decisions   of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government in   some substantive arena--in this case, the regulation of labor   practices. The central issue of the research is how the social   structure of relationships among organizations in the national labor   policy domain affect the processes by which policy proposals are   generated, placed on the national political agenda, and subsequently   enacted or blocked. To address this issue, the most active   organizations in the United States labor policy domain were identified   and contacted for interviews. A knowledgeable representative from each   organization, typically a director of governmental affairs, was asked a   battery of questions about his or her organization's involvement in   shaping national policies. The general scope of these questions was (1)   What particular issues in the labor field are of interest to the   organization? (2) In what specific policy events between 1981 and 1987   did the organization participate, and what was the nature of that   involvement? (3) What general patterns of interaction does the   organization have with other participants in the national labor policy   domain? Variables in the collection include collective bargaining   regulations, participation of labor in management and control of   enterprises, employee stock ownership plans, and internal organization   and governance of labor unions and employer associations. Other items   cover working conditions (safety and physical conditions), employment   conditions (hiring, promotion, firing, layoff, retirement, time, and   wages), social policies (pensions, insurance, maternity leave, and job   rights), disadvantaged populations in the labor market (women,   minorities, the handicapped, youth, the elderly, veterans, welfare,   vocational education and retraining), discrimination in employment, and   labor market policies (job creation, immigration, underground economy,  and plant closings)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"domestic policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"federal government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor (work)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"organizations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policy making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"private sector"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XV.A.
