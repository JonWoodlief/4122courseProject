The  target age range for the children was 19 to 35 months. Respondents were  queried on the number of children present in the household between the  ages of 12 months and 3 years, their dates of birth, their sex, whether  there were vaccination records for the children, whether those records  were accessible, whether the respondent was the adult in the household  most knowledgeable about the vaccinations, and whether the respondent  accompanied the children to more than 50 percent of their vaccinations.  For each child in the household, information was gathered on whether  each child had received all of the recommended vaccinations, and the  number of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis shots (DTP or DT), polio  vaccinations, measles vaccinations, meningitis or Haemophilus Influenzae  type B (HIB) shots, varicella (chicken pox) vaccinations, rotavirus  shots, pneumococcal shots, and hepatitis B (Hep B) shots each child had  received. Further information was obtained about additional vaccinations  the child may have received to combat diseases such as tuberculosis,  typhoid, yellow fever, and malaria, the child's health care providers,  the number of doctors that had performed vaccinations, and whether the  measles vaccination was strictly for measles or for the  measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combination. Additional information was  gathered regarding whether the child received benefits from the  nutrition and health program for Woman, Infants, and Children (WIC),  what age the child began receiving WIC benefits, whether the child's  vaccination records were checked at the WIC certification visit, and  whether these benefits had ever been interrupted for six months or more.  Once parental consent was obtained, health care providers were queried  on the vaccination records for each child whose vaccination information  was gathered from parents. Health care providers were queried on the  type and the level of detail of the vaccination records for each child,  the dates and types of vaccinations administered, the date of each  child's first visit to that provider regardless of reason, the date of  the child's most recent visit to that provider regardless of reason, and  the type of care the provider gave to the child. Health care provider  respondents were asked to describe their facility, to give their  position within the facility, the child's date of birth, according to  their records, and whether the child was known by another last name, and  to provide a list of any additional health care providers for that  child. Demographic information provided by the parents or guardians  includes the number of people living in the household, the number of  people over and under 18 in the household, respectively, the number of  children under the age of 12 months, ethnicity of respondent and child,  marital status of the respondent, respondent's relationship to the  child, respondent's educational level or that of the child's mother, the  birthdate of the child's mother, household income, and whether the child was living at the same address as when he or she was born."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care delivery"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"immunization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vaccines"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
