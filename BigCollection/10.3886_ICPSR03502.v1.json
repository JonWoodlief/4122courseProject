Utah's Juvenile  Sentencing Guidelines were an attempt by a sentencing commission to\nstructure juvenile court sentencing flexibly, using advisory,  offense-based guidelines that covered the continuum of sanctions  available for juvenile offenders. Policymakers designed a sanction  intended to create locally-designed, intensive service programs that  would be largely in-home efforts, with short-term out-of-home  placements in a community setting when needed. Taken together, the  Sentencing Guidelines and State Supervision sanction were designed to  bring about a reduction in juvenile recidivism rates and subsequently  to reduce the number of offenders placed out of the home in the  custody of the Division of Youth Corrections by 5 percent. The  objectives of this evaluation were to: (1) assess the ability of a  state to implement juvenile sentencing guidelines and an intermediate  sanction designed to intervene earlier in the lives of juvenile  offenders, (2) assess the effectiveness of this earlier intervention  program on reducing criminal activity and rates of commitment to Youth  Corrections, and (3) identify local approaches to the new program that show promise."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Researchers combined quantitative measures of  sentencing guidelines compliance and recidivism rates with qualitative  interviews of juvenile justice system personnel and youth  offenders.

All offenders  were interviewed alone with the exception of four youths whose  parent(s) requested to be present during the interview. Offender  interviews typically lasted between 15 and 25 minutes.

All probation officers who  specialized in provision of State Supervision services and program  providers were solicited for participation to ensure a complete  description of State Supervision programs. Forty percent of all  full-time intake and probation officers in each judicial district and  assistant regional directors and case managers in each correctional  region were solicited for participation. These participants were  chosen at random from a list provided by the chief probation officer  in each court district and the central administration of the Division  of Youth Corrections, respectively. Additionally, a list of  prosecutors and defense attorneys provided by each chief probation  officer was used to randomly solicit participation from one person in  each category in each judicial district. Finally, interviews were  sought from five offenders on each participating field or State  Supervision probation officer's caseload. These offenders were  randomly chosen from a list provided by the officer. Participants were  recruited using the following protocol: The head of each agency sent a  letter to employees of the agency requesting accommodation of the  evaluation. Informed consent was obtain\ned from all adult participants  and parents or guardians of minors.
