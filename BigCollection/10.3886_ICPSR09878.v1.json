Both race and age are tabulated by sex and Hispanic   origin for several layers of geography. The race data were modified to   make reporting categories comparable to those used by state and local   agencies. The 1990 Census included 9,804,847 persons who checked the   \"other race\" category and were therefore not included in one of the   15 racial categories listed on the Census form. \"Other race\" is   usually not an acceptable reporting category for state and local   agencies. Therefore, the Census Bureau assigned each \"other race\"   person to the specified race reported by another person geographically   close with an identical response to the Hispanic-origin question.   Hispanic origin was taken into account because over 95 percent of the   \"other race\" persons were of Hispanic origin. (Hispanic-origin   persons may be of any race.) The assignment of race to Hispanic-origin   persons did not affect the Hispanic-origin category that they checked   (i.e, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, etc.). Age data were modified   because respondents tended to report age as of the date they completed   the 1990 questionnaire, instead of age as of the April 1, 1990 Census   date. In addition, there may have been a tendency for respondents to   round up their age if they were close to having a birthday. Age data   for individuals in households were modified by adjusting the reported   birth-year data by race and sex for each of the 1990 Census's 449   district offices to correspond with the national level quarterly   distribution of births available from the National Center for Health   Statistics. The data for persons in group quarters were adjusted   similarly, but on a state basis. The age adjustment affects   approximately 100 million people. In this file their adjusted age is  one year different from that reported in the 1990 Census."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"age"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hispanic origins"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household composition"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR I.A.1.d.
