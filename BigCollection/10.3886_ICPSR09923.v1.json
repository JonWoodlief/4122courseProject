Within each sampled county, survey  questionnaires were distributed to the police chief of the largest  city, the sheriff, the jail administrator, the prosecutor, the chief  trial court judge, the trial court administrator (where applicable),  and probation and parole agency heads. Although the general topics  covered in the questionnaires are similar, specific items are not  repeated across the questionnaires, except for those given to the  sheriffs and the police chiefs. The sheriffs surveyed were those with  law enforcement responsibilities, so the questions asked of the police  chiefs and the sheriffs were identical. The questionnaires were  tailored to each group of respondents, and dealt with five general  areas: (1) background characteristics, including staff size, budget  totals, and facility age, (2) criminal justice system problems, (3)  prison crowding, (4) personnel issues such as training needs and  programs, and (5) operations and procedures including management,  management information, and the specific operations in which the  respondents were involved. In some cases, sets of question items were  grouped into question batteries that dealt with specific topic areas  (e.g., staff recruitment, judicial training, and number of personnel).  For example, the Staff Recruitment battery items in the Probation and  Parole Questionnaire asked respondents to use a 4 point scale to  indicate the seriousness of each of the following problems: low  salaries, poor image of corrections work, high entrance requirements,  location of qualified staff, shortage of qualified minority applicants, and hiring freezes."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Institute for Law and Justice conducted the  1986 National Assessment Program (NAP) survey to determine the needs  and problems of local and state criminal justice practitioners.
