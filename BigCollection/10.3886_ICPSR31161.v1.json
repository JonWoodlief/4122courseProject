The sample was designed to be representative of all general purpose state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States, with separate samples drawn for local police departments and sheriffs' offices. Agencies serving special jurisdictions (such as schools, airports, or parks) or with special enforcement responsibilities (such hunting and fishing laws or alcohol laws) were considered out of scope for the survey. Sheriffs' offices without primary law enforcement jurisdiction were also considered out of scope for the survey. In addition, some smaller local police departments were determined to have closed since the 2004 CSLLEA and were dropped from the sample. After all out-of-scope and closed agencies were dropped, the final sample size for the survey was 3,095. The final sample included 950 self-representing (SR) agencies with 100 or more sworn personnel, and 2,145 nonself-representing (NSR) agencies employing fewer than 100 sworn personnel. The SR agencies included 591 local police departments, 310 sheriffs' offices, and 49 state law enforcement agencies. All 950 SR agencies received the 49-item CJ-44L questionnaire. The NSR local police agencies were selected using a stratified random sample with cells based on the number of sworn personnel. The NSR sheriffs' offices were selected using a simple random sample. Overall, the NSR sample included 1,504 local police departments and 641 sheriffs' offices. All 2,145 NSR agencies received the 40-item CJ-44S questionnaire."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self-enumerated questionnaire"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Created variable labels and/or value labels."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), 2007","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41206,"dataFile":{"id":2658761,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS), 2007","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
