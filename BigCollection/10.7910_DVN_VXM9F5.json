It was conducted in two separate phases. The first phase included a longitudinal cohort-sequential \"High School Study,\" a longitudinal \"College Study,\" and a one-wave \"Family Interview Study.\" The second phase, the \"Young Adult Follow-Up Study\", included two samples of participants from phase one who were followed for two additional waves.\r\n<br /><br />  The \"High School Study\" consisted of three randomly sampled cohorts of female and male 7th, 8th, and 9th graders, followed annually from 1969 to 1972, and totaling 589 participants. The \"College Study\" was comprised of a 1951 birth cohort of 276 female and male participants who were followed annually from 1970 to 1973. A 50-page questionnaire was administered to the participants of both the \"High School Study\" and the \"College Study\" during these four waves of data collection. The questionnaire contained a variety of subscales which focused on behavior, personality, and perceived environment.\r\n<br /><br />  The \"High School Study\" participants and the \"College Study\" participants were jointly followed-up in 1979 (Wave V) and 1981 (Wave VI) to form the \"Young Adult Follow-Up Study.\" In Wave VI, there were a total of 384 \"High School Study\" participants and a total of 184 \"College Study\" participants. At each data collection, a questionnaire was sent to participants focusing on life issues of importance and related behaviors in young adulthood.<br /><br />  A study of maternal ideology, the \"Family Interview Study,\" was conducted in 1970 consisting of 200 parents of participants in the \"High School Study.\" Data gathered through a semistructured interview with mothers covered aspects of parental beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and socialization practices. Mothers and fathers independently filled out a questionnaire consisting of personality and attitude measures."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social
