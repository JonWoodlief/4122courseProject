The authors explore how a quantitative decision aid has  been implemented and used in Oklahoma. The researchers studied how the  Wisconsin risks/needs instruments were implemented by the Oklahoma  Probation and Parole Department, how they were actually used, and the  attitudes towards them held by probation and parole officers. The  researchers addressed a number of issues including (1) the usefulness  of the risk/needs assessment instruments, (2) what the instruments are  useful for, (3) why officers use the instruments, (4) whether the  instruments are manipulated by officers, and (5) job satisfaction. In  addition, some demographic and background information was collected on  the respondents, including age, sex, education, years of probation and  parole experience, caseload, and experience with previous risk/needs  assessment instruments. The research should be useful in identifying  the attitudes and concerns of probation and parole professionals who  use quantitative decision aids and in determining the perceived utility of these aids."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The researchers were interested in collecting data  on attitudes towards and actual use of quantitative decision aids  among probation and parole officers in Oklahoma.
