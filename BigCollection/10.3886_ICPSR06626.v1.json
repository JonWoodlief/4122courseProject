Data were collected primarily  through a one-page, two-sided survey instrument given to police  officers. In addition, screening interviews regarding the use of force  during the arrest were conducted with both officers and suspects to  assess the reliability of the officer surveys. During the screening  interviews, officers and suspects were asked brief questions about the  use and extent of force by officers and suspects. In the officer  survey form, six potential areas of force were identified: voice,  motion, restraints, tactics, weapons, and injuries. Three dimensions  of weapons use--possession, threatened use, and actual use--were also  recorded.

This study was concerned with describing the  amount of force used in different arrest situations and determining  the extent to which officer, suspect, offense, and arrest situation  characteristics can predict the amount of force used. Unlike much of  the prior research, which is concerned with defining excessive force,  the central concern of the principal investigators was to measure the  amount of force used by and against police officers in a sample of  arrests. Thus, a series of variables were constructed that are  sensitive to capturing variation in the full range of force that would be common in most arrests."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The researchers collected data primarily using a  two-page survey form completed by Phoenix police officers following  most adult custody arrests made during a two-week period beginning  June 13, 1994. and officer and suspect characteristics. The survey was  developed during the fall of 1993, tested during a one-day feasibility  study in February 1994, and subsequently revised for use. In addition,  the researchers constructed a screening survey of officers and a  sample of suspects booked in the Maricopa County Jail to test the  reliability of the survey responses and to obtain additional details  about the nature of the arrest that could not be obtained in the  officer survey form. The results of these screening interviews are  contained in Part 2, Police Screen Interview Data, and Part 3, Suspect  Screen Interview Data. Both the officer surveys and the  officer/suspect interviews were voluntary and anonymous. No officer or  suspect identifiers w\nere collected, and the only information obtained  about the arrests came from the survey forms. These procedures were  implemented to encourage participation and truthful responses and to  protect the anonymity of research subjects. With the data, the  researchers were able to compare the detailed information in the  officer survey with the measures of force and to develop multivariate statistical models for evaluation."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In the survey forms completed by the police  officers, six potential areas of force were identified: voice, motion,  restraints, tactics, weapons, and injuries.
