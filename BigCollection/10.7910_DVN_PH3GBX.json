We do not, however, rely exclusively on the predominant statistical models---variants of standard regression analysis---to address them. Because these tools alone are ill-suited to the task at hand, we deploy a more appropriate methodology---non-parametric matching---which follows from a formal framework for causal inference.\n<br /><br />\r \r Applying matching methods to sex discrimination suits resolved in the federal circuits between 1995 and 2002 yields two clear results. First, we observe substantial individual effects: The probability of a judge deciding in favor of the party alleging discrimination decreases by about 10 percentage points when the judge is a male. Likewise, we find that when a woman serves on a panel with men, the men are significantly more likely to rule in favor of the rights litigant. Both eff\nects are is so persistent and consistent that they may come as a surprise even to those scholars who have long posited the existence of gendered judging."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Christina L.
