The file combines the individual 5-percent state files for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico as released by the United States Census Bureau into a single analysis file. The file contains information on all households that contain at least one person aged 65 years or more in residence as of the 2000 Census enumeration. The file contains individual records on all persons aged 65 and older living in households as well as individual records for all other members residing in each of these households. Consequently, this file can be used to examine both the characteristics of the elderly in the United States as well as the characteristics of individuals who co-reside with persons aged 65 and older as of the year 2000. All household variables from the household-specific \"Household record\" of the 2000 PUMS are appended to the end of each individual level record. This file is not a special product of the Census Bureau and is not a resample of the PUMS data specific to the elderly population. While it is comparable to the 1990 release CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 1990: [UNITED STATES]: PUBLIC USE MICRODATA SAMPLE: 3-PERCENT ELDERLY SAMPLE (ICPSR 6219), the sampling procedures and weights for the 2000 file reflect the methodology that applies to the 5-percent PUMS release CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 2000 [UNITED STATES]: PUBLIC USE MICRODATA SAMPLE: 5-PERCENT SAMPLE (ICPSR 13568).
