In multiple California communities, five ch\nronic medical   conditions were studied: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,   congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. This   collection includes data from two surveys, one of adults in the   communities (Part 1, Community Health Care Survey Data), and the other   of physicians who provide adult primary care in the same communities   (Part 3, Physician Practice Survey Data). Topics covered included   respondent self-report of access to care in the community (including   health insurance status, whether the respondent had a regular source of   care, and specific and overall difficulties in obtaining care),   respondent propensity to seek care (how important the respondent   thought it was to see a physician for each of five major symptoms),   physician predisposition to hospitalize patients, and physician   responsiveness to patients' social factors (such as whether the patient   was an alcoholic or an IV drug user, uninsured, homeless, lived alone,   or was covered by Medicaid). Demographic variables include sex, race,  education, household income, and marital status."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA IV.
