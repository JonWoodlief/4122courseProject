In this paper we show that evidence used to rule out a second assassin is\r fundamentally flawed. This paper discusses new compositional analyses of bullets\r reportedly to have been derived from the same batch as those used in the assassination.\r The new analyses show that the bullet fragments involved in the assassination are not\r nearly as rare as previously reported. In particular, the new test results are compared to\r key bullet composition testimony presented before the House Selec\nt Committee on\r Assassinations (HCSA). Matches of bullets within the same box of bullets are shown to\r be much more likely than indicated in the House Select Committee on Assassinationsâ€™\r testimony. Additionally, we show that one of the ten test bullets is considered a match to\r one or more assassination fragments. This finding means that the bullet fragments from\r the assassination that match could have come from three or more separate bullets.\r Finally, this paper presents a case for reanalyzi\nng the assassination bullet fragments and\r conducting the necessary supporting scientific studies. These analyses will shed light on\r whether the five bullet fragments constitute three or more separate bullets. If the\r assassination fragments are derived from three or more separate bullets, then a second\r assassin is likely, as the additional bullet would not be attributable to the main suspect,\r Mr. Oswald."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clifford Spiegelman, William A.
