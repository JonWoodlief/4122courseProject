This poll interviewed 1,051 adults nationwide, including 952 registered voters. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the presidency, whether the country was moving in the right direction, and about the condition of the national economy. Registered voters were asked how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, whether they had voted in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus in their state, the likelihood that they would vote in the general election, which presidential candidate they would vote for, and whether they planned to vote in person on election day, by mail or absentee ballot, or at an early voting location before election day. Those who had already voted were asked which presidential candidate they had voted for. Views were also sought on presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain and vice-presidential candidates Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. Other questions addressed the respondent's financial situation compared to four years ago, how long they had lived at their current residence, and whether a person's race affected their chances of getting ahead in today's society. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, military service, religious preference, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Biden,
