Specifically, the study utilized Cohort 9 and Cohort 12 data which were each comprised of 752 individuals and Cohort 15 data which was comprised of 626 individuals. Each of the cohorts was interviewed approximately two years apart. The study analyses were expanded to the neighborhood level through use of data from the PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS: COMMUNITY SURVEY, 1994-1995 (ICPSR 2766). Approximately 8,700 Chicago residents (25 to 50 per neighborhood) were surveyed regarding their perception of their neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>The PHDCN measures used in this study focused on two major aspects of adolescent antisocial behavior (substance use, delinquency) and a number of domains that have been utilized in explaining them. The self-reported substance use and delinquency outcome variables were measured across three waves for Cohorts 9, 12, and 15. Other items included in study analyses include measures of individual risk, family/parental influences, social support, antisocial peers, sociodemographics, and neighborhood influence.</p>\n\n<p>This analysis of existing PHDCN data used multiple cohort and multilevel latent growth models as well as several ancillary approaches to answer questions pertinent to the development of adolescent antisocial behavior. The first question was: (1) How are trajectories of substance use and delinquency across adolescence best described? This involved (a) an assessment of sample-average initial levels (intercept) and trends (slope) and their variance estimates; (b) plotting observed and expected trends across ages 9 to 19; and (c) testing group (cohort) differences in latent growth factors (intercept, slope). The second question was (2) To what extent do key individual and social influence measures available in PHDCN (e.g., self control, family i\nnfluence, peer influence) impact the initial level of substance use/delinquency? This entailed (a) testing the effects of individual, family, and peer covariates on the intercept; (b) assessing relevant interaction effects for individual and family/peers; and (c) examining cohort differences in covariate effects. Third, (3) To what extent do key individual and social influences impact the progression (slope) of substance use/delinquency over time? This shifted the emphasis to the enduring impact of these risk or protective factors. A \"launch\" perspective was used to frame the analysis around the second and third questions. Fourth, the analysis considered (4) Do youth trajectories of substance use and delinquency vary across neighborhoods? The process for answering this question entailed: (a) assessing neighborhood cluster-level variance components for the intercept and slope; (b) assessing neighborhood cluster-level variance components for covariate effects (i.e., neighborhood influences) where relevant and; (c) assessing neighborhood influences on covariate effects (i.e., cross-level interactions) when variation was identified at the previous stage.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Outcome measures include self-reported substance use and delinquency.
