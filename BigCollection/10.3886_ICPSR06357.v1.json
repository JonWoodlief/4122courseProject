In Phase 1 of the study, 52 female and   48 male clients of a neighborhood mediation center were assessed on the   number and kinds of strategies they\nutilized in dealing with conflicts   before they consulted the mediation center, their feelings about the   services rendered, the concerns, fears, and other affective states   experienced in relation to their disputes, their feelings about the   outcomes, to what they attributed success or failure, and how they felt   gender had affected the conflicts. Phase 2 of the study was implemented   as a follow-up to determine the generalizability of the findings of   Phase 1. Respondents from the same geographic area in which the   subjects in Phase 1 were drawn were assessed on three areas of concern   in relation to a hypothetical conflict: feelings of vulnerability,   aspects of mediation that seemed desirable to them, and concerns they  might have if they were to use mediation services."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.H.
