In the intervening  years this Sample Survey provides basic data about the national jail  population. The first Sample Survey was conducted in 1982 and was  followed by a complete census of jails in 1983. Sample Surveys have  been conducted in 1984 and, most recently, in 1985. The Omnibus Crime  Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3732),  authorized the collection of this information.
