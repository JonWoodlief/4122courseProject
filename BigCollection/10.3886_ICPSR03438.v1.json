Telephone and  personal interviews were conducted with people who had experience with  or knowledge of sex trafficking in the United States. This data  collection consists of the verbatim questions and responses from the  following groups of individuals who were interviewed: (1)  international and United States women who had been or were in the sex  industry in the United States, (2) law enforcement officials who had  experience and expertise in sex-industry related cases or immigration,  (3) social service workers who provided services to women in  prostitution or might have come into contact with women from the sex  industry and those providing services to immigrant populations, and  (4) health care workers who provided services to women in prostitution  or who may have come into contact with women in the sex industry. The  research framework was developed to follow the path of trafficked  women from their hometown, through their experiences in the sex  industry, to their present place in life. Information was collected  on trafficked women's backgrounds, roles and activities while in the  sex industry, how they were controlled, and how they coped with their  situations. Respondents were also asked about experiences with  recruiters, traffickers, pimps, and customers. Additional information  was gathered on the respondents' views on policies regarding  trafficking and prostitution, the organization of the sex industry,  and health and legal aspects of the business.

The  goal was to gather information from the most informed experts on the  topic, not to do a broad survey of knowledge and attitudes. The data  files in this collection consist of the verbatim questions and  responses from the following groups of individuals who were  interviewed: (1) international (Parts 1-16) and United States (Parts  17-41) women who had been or were in the sex industry in the United  States, (2) law enforcement officials who had experience and expertise  in sex-industry related cases or immigration (Pa\nrts 42-66), (3) social  service workers who provided services to women in prostitution or  might have come into contact with women from the sex industry and  those providing services to immigrant populations (Parts 67-101), and  (4) health care workers who provided services to women in prostitution  or who may have come into contact with women in the sex industry  (Parts 102-107). A research framework was developed to follow the path  of trafficked women from their hometown, through their experiences in  the sex industry, to their present place in life. Interviewees were  asked about women's backgrounds before being recruited or trafficked  into the sex industry, about the methods used to recruit them, whether  and how they were moved around while in the sex industry, how they  were initiated into the roles and activities they had to carry out,  how they were controlled while in the sex industry, and how they coped  with and resisted the conditions under which they lived. Interviewees  were asked for their recommendations for policies on trafficking and  prostitution. Since the women interviewed most likely had daily  contact with other women in prostitution, they were asked for their  observations and knowledge about other women (possibly trafficked  women) in the sex industry. Women were asked about their experiences  with recruiters, traffickers, and pimps and the men who buy them in  the sex industry. They were asked about their health and well-being  while in the sex industry and after getting out. Interviewees were  also asked about the operation of the sex industry in their city or  region. They were asked about who the traffickers were, how they  operated, and how the sex industry was organized in that area. The  questionnaire used in this study was constructed and organized by  topics related to the path trafficked women might follow and the  operation of the sex industry in which they were  exploited. Questionnaires for each group of interviewees were  constructed according to the topics about which each group would most  likely have knowledge or experience. The questionnaires were composed of open- and closed-ended questions on each topic."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"inap."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prostitution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sex offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sex trafficking"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sexual exploitation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"women"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

(2) The number of data files in this collection does not  match the number of interviews described in the Final Report for this  project because ICPSR did not include duplicate interviews in this  collection. (3) The data files were converted to plain ASCII text from  Microsoft Word documents by ICPSR. Some formatting from the MSWord  files were not retained in the conversion. Data users are strongly  encouraged to use the data files in conjunction with the PDF data  collection instrument provided as part of this data collection to  distinguish question text and interviewer prompts from actual  responses from interviewees. In particular, data users should note  that many of the closed-ended questions required a discrete answer  from the respondents, such as \"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"Don't know.\" Responses  to such questions may be present in the data file in one of three  ways: (1) interviewers typed the respondent's answer after the  question, (2) all possible responses are present for a question and  the respondents' answers are designated by an \"X\" to the left of the  given response, or (3) all possible responses are present but none is  marked, indicating that the question was not answered. (4) ICPSR  blanked certain identifying information, such as names and  locations. This information has been replaced by a generic identifier  in brackets, such as [name].
