The purpose of this project is to answer fundamental questions focusing on the identification of those factors that motivate some members of ethnic minorities to become radicalized, to form activist organizations, and to move from conventional means of politics and protest into violence and terrorism. Focusing initially on the Middle East and North Africa, the MAROB project provides information on the characteristics of those ethnopolitical organizations most likely to employ violence and terrorism in the pursuit of their perceived grievances with local, national, or international authority structures.

Instead, member organizations are coded.                                                                                     Organizations were selected on the basis of their basic longevity. This was operationalized in the following manner: The first year that an organization is mentioned in a source as being active, it is put on a “watchlist” for potential inclusion. Once the organization is mentioned in sources for three consecutive years, it is included in the dataset, coded from the first year of the three consecutive years. If an organization included in the dataset disappears from source material for five consecutive years, it is no longer coded for following years. If after that time, it is again mentioned for three consecutive years, it is again included but as a separate organization."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record abstracts"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"MAROB_ME_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43250,"dataFile":{"id":2298716,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"MAROB_ME_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":343480,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:68889","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9b8577e792d7a9be7686e6fb04e36da6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9b8577e792d7a9be7686e6fb04e36da6"}}},{"description":"","label":"MAROB_ME_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43250,"dataFile":{"id":2298935,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"MAROB_ME_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":891205,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69072","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","originalFileSize":767301,"UNF":"UNF:5:qvN7+gsRsnFRvZpkEupM1A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"bbac531dabbad1fd654e34b65af89d4f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"bbac531dabbad1fd654e34b65af89d4f"}}}]}}}
