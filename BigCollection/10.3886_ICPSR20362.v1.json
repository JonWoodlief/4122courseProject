The SACSI Process Questionnaire covered a broad range of  issues related to the way in which the SACSI process was unfolding  from the perspective of the Core Team and the Working Group. All  members of the Core Team and the Working Group were provided with  questionnaires to complete at the beginning of one of their respective  meetings. Part 1 provides survey responses from 28 members of the  Working Group and/or Core Team who completed the questionnaires. The  questionnaires were essentially equivalent except that Core Team  members were asked to rate a number of issues with regard to the Core  Team, while Working Group members were asked to rate those same issues  with regard to the Working Group.

The Notification Program entailed delivering a  \"stop-the-violence\" message to juvenile offenders, as well as adult  offenders who were known to be involving juveniles in their crimes.  Typically, those being notified were on probation. Under this program  the Winston-Salem Police Department \"called in\" a group of individuals  from the target population and, over the course of a one- to two-hour  session, repeatedly \"notified\" the participants that the community  would not tolerate any more instances of violent behavior on their  part. The message for older offenders was, \"No guns, no violence, and  do not involve kids in criminal activity.\" For juveniles the message  of \"No guns, no violence,\" was the same.</p>\n\n<p>To determine if criminal behavior changed following the  Notification Program, the research team obtained arrest records from  the Winston-Salem Police Department of 138 subjects who had attended a  notification session between September 9, 1999 and September 7, 2000  (Part 2). These records listed all arrests for SACSI-defined crimes  (i.e., homicide, aggravated assault, kidnapping, rape, robbery, and  weapons violation), as well as arrests for \"simple assault\" between  January 1998 and January 2001. The final report stated that any given  individual in the sample was followed for at least one year subsequent  to notification. However, given the revised versions of Table 10,  Table 12, and Table 13 that the principal investigators provided, not  all notified offenders were followed for at least one year.
