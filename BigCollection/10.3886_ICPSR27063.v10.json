The asterisks represent Chinese characters that were illegible and could not be  translated. The number of asterisks equals the number of illegible characters (two asterisks = two illegible characters). All other non-alphanumeric characters and numbers result from errors in transcription or from transformations between input systems. NAME may include invalid or incorrect romanizations as a result of such errors. NAME also contains unknown codes such as \"Illegible\" where the name was completely illegible and no determination could be made as to the number of Chinese characters.

Under some circumstances, they may be coded as -1 when they should be 0. In this release, -1 may be safely recoded to 0. In the future, the code will be modified to handle the exceptional cases that lead to the erroneous counts.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For the Kinship dataset, the variables F_ID_1 through M_ID_4 do not have value labels for the missing value -99 in Stata, due to limitations with string variables in Stata.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The Disability and Position files are intended to be merged with the Analytic dataset using the variables DATASET, POSITION_CODE, and DISABILITY_CODE.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For the Disability and Position files, the variables CONDITION_PINYIN, POSITION_PINYIN, and POSITION_CORE have values that contain characters such as parenthesis, question marks, and box symbols. These reflect cases where the original information was illegible and the coder made their best guess, or where computer programs converted illegible characters to system default characters.

Each of the 29 register series corresponded to a specific rural population concentrated in a small number of neighboring villages. These populations were affiliated with the Eight Banner civil and military administration that the Qing state used to govern northeast China as well as some other parts of the country. 16 of the 29 populations are regular bannermen. In these populations adult males had generous allocations of land from the state, and in return paid an annual fixed tax to the Imperial Household Agency, and provided to the Imperial Household Agency such home products as homespun fabric and preserved meat, and/or such forest products as mushrooms.  In addition, as regular bannermen they were liable for military service as artisans and soldiers which, while in theory an obligation, was actually an important source of personal revenue and therefore a political privilege. 8 of the 29 populations are special duty banner populations. As in the regular banner population, the adult males in the special duty banner populations also enjoyed state allocated land free of rent. These adult males were also assigned to provide special services, including collecting honey, raising bees, fishing, picking cotton, and tanning and dyeing. The remaining populations were a diverse mixture of estate banner and servile populations. The populations covered by the registers, like much of the population of rural Liaoning in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, were mostly descendants of Han Chinese settlers who came from Shandong and other nearby provinces in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in response to an effort by the Chinese state to repopulate the region."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Performed consistency checks."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Analytic Supplement - Disability","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625138,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Analytic Supplement - Disability","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Analytic Supplement - Position","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625139,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Analytic Supplement - Position","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Annual Grain Prices","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625142,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Annual Grain Prices","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Liaoning Analytic File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625136,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Liaoning Analytic File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Liaoning Basic File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625134,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Liaoning Basic File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Liaoning Kinship File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625137,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Liaoning Kinship File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Liaoning Restricted File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625135,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Liaoning Restricted File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Monthly Grain Prices","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625141,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Monthly Grain Prices","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Natural Disasters","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625144,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Natural Disasters","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Position 2 Supplement","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625140,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Position 2 Supplement","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Yingkou Custom Records","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37171,"dataFile":{"id":2625143,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Yingkou Custom Records","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
