(2) This dataset has the same hierarchical   structure as the 5-percent PUMS. There is a separate record type for   each of the two levels in the hierarchy: the housing level is   represented by a housing record comprising 112 housing variables, the   person level by a person record comprising 123 person variables. (These   variable counts do not include the housing serial number, SERIALNO, and   the variable denoting the record type, RECTYPE. These two variables   appear on both the housing and person records). Each occupied housing   unit is represented by a single housing record, followed by one or more   person records, one for each person in the household. Each vacant   housing unit is represented by a solitary housing record, which is not   followed by any person records. Every person residing in group quarters   is represented by a single housing record followed by a person record.   In all, this dataset contains 361,185 records.

The 5-percent PUMS, derived from responses to the   Census long-form questionnaire, is a 5-percent stratified sample of   persons and housing units enumerated in the 1990 Census (housing units   and their occupants, vacant housing units, and persons in group   quarters).
