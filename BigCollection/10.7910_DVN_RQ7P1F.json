However, literature doesn’t provide an answer to the following question: what explains fluctuations in the use of negative messages within political organisations during a given political campaign? The present paper examines this question in the context of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Data consists of all tweets distributed by the official Twitter account of both organisations (@YesScotland and @UK_Together) between June 16, 2014 and September 17, 2014. Results are obtained by a non-parametric local regression (lowess) and by time-series regression analyses. Our analysis demonstrates that having an advance in the polls had a statistically significant influence on the tweet sentiment of at least one organisation during the referendum campaign: Better Together’s messages were more negative when it was ahead in the polls. Meanwhile, Yes Scotland’s messages were more negative after each of the leaders’ debates.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-09-30"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Brie, Evelyne"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-08-30"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Public Opinion Data and Daily Tweet Sentiment Average (June 16, 2014 to September 17, 2014).","label":"PollData-ForRegression.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":128510,"dataFile":{"id":3050328,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RQ7P1F/CJTHSM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RQ7P1F/CJTHSM","filename":"PollData-ForRegression.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":14207,"description":"Public Opinion Data and Daily Tweet Sentiment Average (June 16, 2014 to September 17, 2014).","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15e33d05b54-d1ffd675dc3e","originalFileFormat":"text/csv","originalFormatLabel":"Comma Separated Values","UNF":"UNF:6:yQF8eJmVr+1Xm1WbNPxuSg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b33fdb6ad835ae2f6490d829cb6bc6ad","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b33fdb6ad835ae2f6490d829cb6bc6ad"}}},{"description":"Tweets from Better Together (July  3, 2013 to September 26, 2014).","label":"UkTogetherTweets.csv","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":128510,"dataFile":{"id":3050333,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RQ7P1F/A1SMVL","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RQ7P1F/A1SMVL","filename":"UkTogetherTweets.csv","contentType":"text/csv","filesize":915770,"description":"Tweets from Better Together (July  3, 2013 to September 26, 2014).","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15e33dd0ae0-87f79c58f3c0","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"915d94bc59734a52bbde0358f1cb6b6f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"915d94bc59734a52bbde0358f1cb6b6f"}}},{"description":"Tweets from Yes Scotland (June 15, 2014 to September 18, 2014).","label":"YesScotlandTweets.csv","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":128510,"dataFile":{"id":3050334,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RQ7P1F/SUUTO4","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RQ7P1F/SUUTO4","filename":"YesScotlandTweets.csv","contentType":"text/comma-separated-values","filesize":921007,"description":"Tweets from Yes Scotland (June 15, 2014 to September 18, 2014).","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15e33dd0d22-2ad1150bd309","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"17dda91a693601f9e78710a7db43f17f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"17dda91a693601f9e78710a7db43f17f"}}}]}}}
