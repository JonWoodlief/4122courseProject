Prevention and management of sport injuries necessitate the existence of a comprehensive system for recording and classification of data. The object of this research was study of specialized sport injuries classification system for modeling of national sport injury classification system.\r\nMethods: This descriptive-comparative study conducted in 2012 .The sport injuries classification systems in USA ,Canada, Australia and Iran were studied .Method for data gathering was checklist that completed with valid library and internet sources. Then, data analysis performed with comparative tables.\r\nResults: Results showed that developed countries were acted to existence of national sport injuries classification system. It adapted with international classification system of diseases and international classification of external causes of injuries .Iran lacks national sport injuries classification system.\r\nConclusion: Designing and using of sport injuries national classification system will have important role in prevention and releasing of sport injuries in Iran. Designing of national sport injuries classification system using of developed countries experiences recommends.
