In addition, respondents were queried on   standard Eurobarometer measures, such as whether they attempted to persuade   others close to them to share their views on subjects they held strong opinions  about, whether they discussed political matters, what their country's goals   should be for the next ten or fifteen years, and whether their country had  benefited from being a member of the European Community (EC). With respect to   transportation issues, the survey assessed how residents of urban areas   perceived the increase in car traffic and how they felt about its consequences,   including effects on air quality and the risk of accidents. Ratings were sought  on the effectiveness of various proposals for solving traffic congestion.   Respondents were asked to indicate how well political decision-makers judged the  feelings of the public on transportation issues, and which types of transport   should be preferred in policy decisions: cars versus public transportation,   cars versus cyclists, and cars versus pedestrians. They were asked to indicate   how frequently they used various types of transportation and their reasons for   using and for not using public transportation. Biotechnology was described as   the recent efforts of scientists to change human cells, micro-organisms like  yeast, crops, and farm animals. Respondents were asked whether such science and  techn\nology in general was likely to improve life in the next 20 years. They were  also asked for their views on the morality of applying biotechnology to animals  and the value of specific areas of research like plant and animal breeding and   the development of hardier micro-organisms for food and waste processing. A   series of questions tested respondents' objective knowledge of biotechnology,   asking them to state whether particular domains such as cancer research or the  treatment of hereditary human diseases were linked to biotechnology. In   addition, self-ratings of competency on these questions were obtained, and   respondents indicated and evaluated their sources of information on technology   and development. This survey also introduced a new set of questions on   individuals' personal experience with the Single European Market through the   purchase of goods or services from other member states of the EC. Respondents   were asked to provide objective information on the particular kinds of products  or services bought or sold, and methods of payment used. They evaluated their   satisfaction with such transactions, and assessed the levels of quality and   standards expected from each of the EC member countries with which they had   dealt. Demographic data collected on respondents include gender, age, marital   status, occupation, religion and religiosity, age at completion of education,  left-right political self-placement, political and trade union participation,   household income, number of people in household, number of children under 15 in  household, subjective membership in social class, home ownership, type of   community, size of locality, and region of residence. Actively employed          respondents were asked a series of questions (A.1 to A.34) regarding health and   safety at work.

(2) A   split ballot was use\nd for this data collection. Half of the respondents were   interviewed using the term \"biotechnology\" in Q.35 to Q.47 of the   questionnaire, and half using the term \"genetic engineering\". The variable V319  indicates to which ballot each record corresponds. (3) Actively employed   respondents were asked a series of questions (A.1 to A.34) regarding health and  safety at work.
