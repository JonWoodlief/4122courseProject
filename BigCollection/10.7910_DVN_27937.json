Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods can facilitate analyses of these arthropod and microbial communities, leading to a better understanding of existing diversity and factors influencing community assembly. The pitchers of carnivorous pitcher plants often house surprisingly discrete communities, and provide ideal systems for analysis using a NGS approach. The plants digest insects in order to access essential nutrients while growing in poor soils; however, the pitchers are also home to communities of living organisms, called inquilines. Certain arthropods appear to have coevolved with their pitcher plant hosts, and are not found in other environments. We used Illumina amplicon sequencing of 18S rDNA to characterize the eukaryotes in three species of Nepenthes pitcher plants: N. gracilis, N. rafflesiana, and N. ampullaria, in each of three different parks in Singapore.  The data reveal an unexpected diversity of eukaryotes, significant differences in community diversity among host species, variation in host specificity of inquilines, and the presence of gregarine parasites. Counts of whole inquiline arthropods from the first collection year are roughly correlated with scaled 18S sequence abundances, indicating that amplicon sequencing is an effective means of gauging community structure. We barcoded a subset of the dipteran larvae using COI primers, and the resulting phylogenetic tree is mostly congruent with that found using the 18S locus, with the exception of one of five morphospecies. For many 18S and COI sequences, the best BLASTn matches showed low sequence identity, illustrating the need for better databases of Southeast Asian dipterans. Finally, networks of core arthropods and their host species were used to investigate degree of host specificity across multiple hosts, and this revealed significant specialization of certain arthropod fauna."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/dvn/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-11-26"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data and R code for Bittleston et al 2015 in Austral Ecology","label":"Bittleston_et_al_AE_2015.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":55980,"categories":["Zipped file"],"dataFile":{"id":2544985,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/27937/2WSO1Z","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/27937/2WSO1Z","filename":"Bittleston_et_al_AE_2015.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":724760,"description":"Data and R code for Bittleston et al 2015 in Austral Ecology","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:299186","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9e629b8ced3dcefe6056dd25ef748d87","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9e629b8ced3dcefe6056dd25ef748d87"}}}]}}}
