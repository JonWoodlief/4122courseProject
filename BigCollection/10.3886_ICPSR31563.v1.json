Respondents were asked which major issue they would address if they were president, whether they agreed or disagreed with United States Supreme Court rule that allowed corporations to spend as much money as they wish on political campaigns, how they were doing financially compared to the past six months, whether they could name the other country that makes up the island of Hispaniola other than Haiti, and whether they thought that network television had generally gotten better or worse in recent years. Respondents were queried on what they missed most about being a child, what was their biggest Internet-related worry, whether they or someone in the household had made any contributions or donations to assist the victims of the earthquake in Haiti, whether they have contributed or donated to any other charities in the past year, whether they donate to charities because they feel they should do it or because they want to help those in need, whether they would like to donate more to charities, whether they mostly donate to charities and organizations in the United States or around the world, and whether they think that people have a moral responsibility to give what they can to help those in need. Respondents were also asked whether they had any siblings, how close they were to their siblings, how close they were with their siblings when they were growing up, whether they were equally close with every siblings or had some siblings that they were closer with, whether they had ever completely stopped talking with a sibling and how long it lasted, whether they ever felt competitive with their siblings and how often, whether their parents treated all the children equally or had favorites, and how often they see their siblings in person. Information was collected on which president the respondent admired most, whether they thought that the founding fathers would be pleased with the way America turned out if they came back to the present day, whether they had taken or planned on taking a winter vacation trip, whether they would marry their current spouse if they had to do it all over again, whether they believed in love at first sight, and what they thought was the most important ingredient for a successful romantic relationship. Finally, respondents were asked whether they believed that there is intelligent life on other planets, whether they believed there is non-intelligent life, such as microbes and bacteria, that exist somewhere in the universe, and whether they thought that we will have conclusive scientific proof of life elsewhere in the universe within the next twenty years.
