The goals of the EPESE project were to describe  and identify predictors of mortality, hospitalization, and placement  in long-term care facilities and to investigate risk factors for  chronic diseases and loss of functioning. The original survey,  ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES OF THE ELDERLY,  1981-1993: [EAST BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, IOWA AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES,  IOWA, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT, AND NORTH CENTRAL NORTH CAROLINA] (ICPSR  9915), elicited information from persons 65 years of age and  older. Six follow-ups were conducted, and information from death  certificates for deaths occurring in the first six years of follow-up  for all four sites was also collected. The data included in this  release of the EPESE make up the seventh follow-up and the fourth  in-person interview for the North Carolina site. This North Carolina  cohort, established in a 1986-1987 baseline survey, was a sample of  persons 65 or older residing in households in Durham, Warren,  Franklin, Granville, and Vance counties in the Central Piedmont area  of North Carolina. The North Carolina site was the only EPESE site in  the southeastern United States. This site was unique in that the  baseline cohort was over 50-percent Black, and the geographic area  selected was diverse, allowing both racial and urban/rural comparisons  to be made regarding the distribution of certain risk factors and  disease. The data cover demographic characteristics (age, sex, race,  income, education, marital status, number of children, employment, and  religion), height, weight, social and physical functioning, chronic  conditions, related health problems, health habits, self-reported use of dental, hospital, and nursing home services, and depression."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"aging"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"chronic illnesses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"epidemiology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hospitalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"long term care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mortality rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"older adults"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk factors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
