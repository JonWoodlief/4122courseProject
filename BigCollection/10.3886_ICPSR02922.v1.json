Respondents were asked which of the following Clinton  proposals they would like to see happen in the coming year: raise the  minimum wage, pass additional gun control laws, pass a patient's bill  of rights, provide prescription drug coverage for Medicare patients,  and cut taxes. Respondents were also asked for their opinions of  Clinton and his handling of the presidency, as well as their opinions  of Vice President Al Gore, and whether Clinton and Congress would work  together in the coming year. An additional question elicited  respondents' views regarding Clinton's claim that the government's  $3.6 trillion federal debt could be paid off by the year  2013.
