It was  designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of  both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the  project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,  adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the  project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these  social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data  about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and  resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which  was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over  6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and  their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing  circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,  that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial  behaviors.

The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into  343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of  racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.  The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were  composed of geographically contiguous census tracts and geog\nraphic  boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered  in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately  8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample  of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21  strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with  the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to  eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic  status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected  at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing  of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant  women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6,  9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through in-person screening  of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The  screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within six months of  the birthday that qualified them for the sample were selected for  inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347  participants were identified through the screening. Of the eligible  study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.</p>\n\n<p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the  child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to  spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research  assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child  interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face  interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the  personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews  were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete  protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was  hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,  Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,  participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other  incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly  drawing prizes were also included.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For  example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking  traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,  delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and  self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also  interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,  parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental  health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Master File</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Master File combines data from all cohorts into one file.
