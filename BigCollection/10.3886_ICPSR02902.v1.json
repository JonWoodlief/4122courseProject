Respondents were asked for their opinions of President Bill Clinton  and his handling of the presidency, as well as their views on the  upcoming November 7, 2000, presidential election and the current  presidential primary/caucus season. Respondents were asked how much  attention they had paid to the 2000 presidential race and whether they  intended to vote in the election. Given a choice among Vice President  Al Gore, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, Texas governor George  W. Bush, and Arizona senator John McCain, those queried were asked for  whom they would vote. Their views were also sought on the most  important issues of this presidential election and which candidate was  best suited to handle issues such as education, the economy, taxes,  Social Security/Medicare, campaign finance reform, international  affairs, and health care. Respondents were asked if the following  statements applied to Bradley, Bush, Gore, or McCain: typical  politician, understands the average American, strong leader,  experienced enough to be president, would bring needed change to  Washington, DC, knowledgeable of world affairs, could be trusted in a  crisis, has a clear idea of where to lead the nation, and says what he  thinks regardless of what is popular. Respondents were asked for whom  they would vote in a Democratic primary or caucus, given a choice  between Gore and Bradley, and for whom they would vote in a Republican  primary or caucus, given a choice among Bush, publisher Steve Forbes,  McCain, radio talk show host Alan Keyes, Family Research Council  president Gary Bauer, and Utah senator Orrin Hatch. Additional topics  focused on whether the amount of money that people could contribute to  political parties should be limited, whether the people of New  Hampshire had too much influence in determining who wins the  Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, whether Bradley's  irregular heartbeat for which he took medication was considered  serious by the American people, and which candidate would best handle  campaign finance reform, taxes, and balancing the federal  budget. Background information on respondents includes age, gender,  education, political party, political orientation, Hispanic descent,  voter registration and participation history, military service, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bradley,
