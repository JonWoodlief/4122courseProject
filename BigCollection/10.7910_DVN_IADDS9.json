In addition, scholars do not agree on the relative effects of international factors and domestic factors on intervention decisions by the U.S. Previous research on the motivations of U.S. interventions has occurred within at least two distinctive “streams” of literature: (1) studies of state interventions; and (2) studies of the use of military force by the U.S. Hypotheses regarding U.S. interventions in intrastate disputes are derived from the previous literature, and the hypotheses are tested using recently-compiled data on intrastate disputes and U.S. interventions in intrastate disputes occurring between 1945 and 2002. The results suggest a combination of international factors, including geographic proximity and ideological linkage, significantly influence the decisions of the U.S. to intervene in intrastate disputes. The results also suggest international factors are generally more important than domestic factors, and the effects of both domestic factors and international factors on U.S. intervention decisions may differ depending on the specific type of intervention and the time period."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-09-27"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Mullenbach.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68401,"dataFile":{"id":1542033,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Mullenbach.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":57085,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:53987","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a75fa4818f33947366ea2649e6337eb1","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a75fa4818f33947366ea2649e6337eb1"}}}]}}}
