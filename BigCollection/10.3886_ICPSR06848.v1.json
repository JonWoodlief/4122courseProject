Rural physicians provided information on the  characteristics of their current pra\nctice setting, such as type of  practice arrangement (solo practice, owner/part owner of group  practice, employed by another physician or group of physicians,  employed by a hospital, community or migrant health center, HMO, or  the federal government, or some other arrangement), number of  physician and nonphysician personnel in the practice, and number of  patient visits. Respondents supplied the number of hours spent  providing patient care and traveling to provide care during the most  recent complete work week, percentage of time spent providing primary  care services, and the usual fee for an office visit for the  evaluation and management of an established patient that required a  detailed examination, medical decision-making of moderate complexity,  and 25 minutes of time face-to-face with the patient (CPT code  99214). Additional topics covered whether the practice had a contract  with a preferred provider organization (PPO), a capitated managed care  plan such as a health maintenance organization (HMO), or an  independent practice association (IPA), and the percentage of the  practice's revenue that came from Medicaid, PPOs for privately insured  patients, IPAs or HMOs for privately insured patients, and  Medicare. The physicians were also asked about plans to expand or  reduce their practice, the amount of debt from medical education they  carried when they first went to work for the rural practice, and  whether working at a rural practice fulfilled a service obligation in  exchange for some or all of the debt from their medical  education. Respondents' opinions were sought on their practice, the  community in which it was located, and on health care reform. Other  information gathered by the survey included location of the practice,  the year the respondent first went to work for the practice, and the  respondent's primary specialty, board certification(s), hospital  admitting privileges, marital status, income, race, and Hispanic origin."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care delivery"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care facilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physician availability"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physician practice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physicians"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rural areas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA I.
