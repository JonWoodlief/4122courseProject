Detailed information was collected from all respondents in  the following subject areas: basic demographic information (age,  gender, race/ethnicity), employment (full/part-time, average hours per  week, type of employer, years employed, functions), education  (degrees, majors, years awarded), training and continuing education  (sources, delivery formats and methods, support from employer for  obtaining, barriers to obtaining, topical priorities), career paths  (impetus for first archival job, careers prior to entering archival  work, plans to leave archival work including retirement), professional  association affiliation (membership in archival and other  associations, support from employer for participation, impetus for  joining), leadership/professional involvement (conference
