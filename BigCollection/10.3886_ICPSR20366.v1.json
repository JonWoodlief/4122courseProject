Participation by the courts in the research does speak to their \"open\" nature and willingness to cast light on \"inner workings\" seldom captured in most studies of judicial decision making (e.g., plea bargaining sentencing), performance, or timeliness. Consequently, the conceptual framework and the array of cultures among the twelve courts might be limited in generality to other \"open\" courts in the rest of the country. That limitation is hardly acute given the current paucity of information on what makes up culture. Future research can determine whether a random sample within the subpopulation of \"open\" courts produces results consistent or divergent with this initial study.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers selected 12 felony criminal trial courts from the states of California, Florida and Minnesota. In California, the research sites were the Superior Courts for Contra Costa, Napa and Ventura Counties. Florida's sites were the Circuit Courts for Duval and Pinellas Counties.
