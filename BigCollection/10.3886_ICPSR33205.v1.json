Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way Barack Obama was handling the presidency and issues such as the economy and foreign policy. They were asked whether they were pleased or disappointed with the outcome of the November congressional elections, which problem they wanted the new Congress to concentrate on, whether they thought Congress would accomplish more in the next two year period than they typically did, and whether they were optimistic that the new Congress would do a better job in the next two years to improve the nation's economy. They were also queried on their feelings about the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, whether Barack Obama would try to work with the Republicans in Congress in order to get things done, whether the Republicans in Congress would try to work with Obama in order to get things done, and whether they thought the main goal of the Republicans in Congress was to pass policies of their own or to block Obama's policies. They were asked whether they thought Obama had a clear plan for creating jobs, whether Republicans in Congress had a clear plan for creating jobs, whether Congress should try to repeal the health care law that was passed in March, whether there should be an increase in federal income taxes for households earning more than $250,000 a year, whether they thought the stock market is fair to all investors, how much the condition of the stock market affected the economy, and whether they had invested any money in the stock market. Opinions were sought on the ability of the United States government to protect its citizens from future terrorist attacks, whether another terrorist attack in the United States was likely in the next few months, whether it would be justified for people of certain racial or ethnic groups to be subject to additional security checks at airport checkpoints, and whether full body X-ray machines should be used at airports. Additional questions addressed respondents' experience with bullying, whether anyone in their household owned a firearm of any kind, whether their family would object to an interracial relationship, and what respondents were most thankful for during the holiday season. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, education level, household income, marital status, religious preference, employment status, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, voting behavior, and whether respondent is a born again Christian."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"airport security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"bullying"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Democratic Party (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income tax"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Obama Administration (2009- )"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Obama, Barack"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Republican Party (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"stock markets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Tea Party movement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.
