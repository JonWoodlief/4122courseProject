This study was based on official records of the use of force and of  arrests maintained by the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD).  The overall objectives of this project were to understand what  constituted a force incident and how the use of different types of  force varied over time and circumstances, including different  characteristics of officers, suspects, and arrest situations. This  study used research methods commonly applied in health research but  rarely used in the study of policing. These methods combined official  records of the use of force with information about a base rate of  police activity, which in this case was adult custody arrests, to  calculate rates of force for different arrest characteristics. It was  hoped that the rate of force, which was defined as the number of force  incidents per 100 adult custody arrests, would provide a rigorous  empirical basis for understanding police behavior, assessing  departmental policies and practices, and testing theories about police behavior."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1 contains data on 2,660 reports filed by  police officers on 2,206 incidents between January 1, 1993, and  December 31, 1999, that involved the use of force. These data were  collected from Use of Force forms filled out by Montgomery County  Police Department officers. Sin\nce April of 1992 MCPD officers have  been required to complete these reports any time a police officer used  force under the following circumstances: (1) there was an injury to an  individual, (2) an individual claimed there was an injury as a result  of the amount of force used, (3) force was applied by use of a  protective instrument, (4) a firearm was discharged, and (5) a  departmental canine inflicted an injury on a subject or defendant in  conjunction with a search, arrest attempt, or apprehension. In  September of 1992 the MCPD expanded the use of force reporting  requirement to include (1) any time a police officer used any form of  force and (2) whenever a police officer was a victim of any type of  force or assault. The MCPD official Use of Force Report form and the  departmental use of force policy were revised several times between  1993 and 1999 and the definition of what types of incidents should be  reported has not always been the same. However, throughout the 1993 to  1999 period, the MCPD Use of Force Report consistently provided  information about the characteristics of the force used, weapon type,  injuries and medical treatment, characteristics of the officer and  citizen involved, and the time, date, and place of the incident. Part  2 contains data on the 30,209 adult custody arrests that took place in  Montgomery County from 1993 to 1999. These data were obtained from  Montgomery County Police Department records. The data in Part 3 were  derived from the data in Parts 1 and 2. Part 3 contains aggregate data  on arrests and the rate of force. The Part 3 data do not include  incidents in which force was used against juveniles nor do they  include use of force incidents that involved canines. In addition, the data in Part 3 only include one report per use of force incident."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables in Part 1 include month, year, day of the  week and time of use of force incident, race, sex, and age of  defendant, type of offense leading to incident, unit or area to which  the officer was assigned, officer sex, race, age, and years of  service, type of force used by officer and defendant, and injuries  sustained by officer and defendant.

Variables  in Part 3 provide aggregate data on the use of force by arrest  characteristics. Nine arrest characteristics are provided by nine  dichotomous variables, and there is one case for every combination of  these nine characteristics. These nine characteristics are officer and  suspect age, sex, and race, whether the offense leading to the  incident was violent, what police district the incident occurred in,  and whether it occurred on a weekend.
