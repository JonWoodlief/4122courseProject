Major areas of   inquiry were the conceptualization, measurement, and identification of   the determinants and consequences of party organizational strength at   state and county levels. Responses were gathered from mailed   questionnaires and personal interviews with various state party   officials. Part 1 contains data collected from former Republican and   Democratic state party c\nhairs (1960-1978) in the 27 sample states of   the data collection. In addition, questionnaires were sent to current   state party chairs (1978-1980) in nonsample states. Topics covered   include: the factors and motives leading the respondent to seek and   accept the chairmanship, budgetary data for typical election and   non-election years, an assessment of the state party organization's   relationship with county party organizations, and the frequency of the   state party's dealings with the National Committee on party matters   such as fund-raising, gaining assistance for state candidates, and   federal appointments and patronage. Part 2 contains results from   personal interviews with both the current state party chairs   (1978-1980) and the executive director for each party in the 27 sample   states. As in Part 1, respondents were questioned on a variety of   issues such as their party's relationship with the National Committee,   an assessment of the most important aspects of their job as chairman,   and the state party's role in recruiting and screening candidates for   state and national positions. Additionally, the executive director for   each party was asked a series of questions concerning the operation and   strength of the party. Items in the series included a description of   the party headquarters, services provided by the party such as public  relations or issue research, and sources of funding."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"electoral systems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"party leaders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"party membership"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"states (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.D.
