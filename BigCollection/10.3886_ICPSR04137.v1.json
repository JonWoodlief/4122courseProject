Part 1 consists of data acquired from interviews of leaders with foreign policy power, specialization, and expertise. These include Congressional members or their senior staff, university administrators and academics who teach in the area of international relations, journalists and editorial staff who handle international news, administration officials and other senior staff in various agencies and offices dealing with foreign policy, religious leaders, senior business executives from FORTUNE 1,000 corporations, labor presidents of the largest labor unions, presidents of major private foreign policy organizations, and presidents of major special interest groups relevant to foreign policy. For Part 2, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations (CCFR) conducted its opinion survey of the American general public through the Internet. In particular, this study covers the global United States position, international norms and the use of force, multilateralism and international institutions, international norms and economic relations, and policy attitudes and perceptions of United States leaders and the public. Regarding the global United States position, respondents were asked to give their opinions on threats to the vital interests that most Americ\nans consider critical, the fundamental foreign policy goals that they want to pursue, how much they are willing to spend on foreign policy-related items, whether they favor the United States having military bases overseas in general and their support for stationing troops in various specified countries, their views on the Middle East, how active the United States should be in world affairs, their willingness to take action against terrorism, and their support for diplomatic and other nonmilitary actions to solve conflicts. On the topic of international norms and the use of force, respondents gave their opinions on adhering to traditional norms and empowering the United Nations, preventive action against a state seeking weapons of mass destruction, using force against a state supporting terrorists, the use of nuclear weapons, the use of torture, using force against a state conduction genocide, using force to restore a democratic government, and defending a country that has been attacked. Concerning multilateralism and international institutions, respondents were asked their level of support for collective decision-making through international institutions and for empowering the United Nations, their attitudes toward other major international organizations, their support for international agreements, their desire to seek consensus among nations, and their opinions on the idea of spreading democracy. On the subject of international norms and economic relations, respondents were asked about pursuing free trade with certain conditions, globalization and trade in principle, their support for the trading system and institutions, their concerns about inequities, and their opinions on mitigating the effects of trade, achieving equity in trade, trade as a strategic tool, responsibility for development aid, regional trade agreements, and migration. For the sake of comparison, Parts 1 and 2 include many of the same questions asked of both groups. Background information on respondents includes religion, age, income, education, gender, marital status, and employment status. Part 3 is a special telephone survey of the general public designed to be directly comparable to the telephone survey of 2002."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Arab Israeli

If the House  or Senate member was not available, the interview was conducted with a  senior staffer responsible for foreign affairs. The FEDERAL YELLOW  BOOK was used to interview assistant secretaries and other senior  level administrative staff. The FORTUNE 1000 list was used to select  names of vice presidents in charge of international affairs in top  corporations. NEWS MEDIA YELLOW BOOK was used to select names of  television and radio news directors, network newscasters, and  newspaper editors and columnists. The CAPITAL SOURCE was used to  select names of presidents of the largest labor unions. United States  NEWS AND WORLD REPORT 2003 list of the top 50 doctoral research  institutions in the United States was\nused to select names of  university presidents and faculty who teach in the field of foreign  affairs at universities. Names of religious leaders representing  faiths proportionate to the number of Americans who worship each faith  were selected from the YEARBOOK OF AMERICAN AND CANADIAN CHURCHES  2004. The CAPITAL SOURCE was used to select names of presidents of  large special interest groups relevant to foreign policy as well as to  select names of presidents of major private foreign policy  organizations. For Part 2, the Internet surveys were conducted by  Knowledge Networks. They utilized list-assisted Random Digit Dialing  (RDD) sampling techniques on the sample frame consisting of the entire  United States telephone population. Telephone numbers were selected  with equal probability for each number. The sample generation system  excluded confirmed disconnected and nonresidential telephone  numbers. Next, the sample was screened to exclude numbers that were  not in the WebTV Internet Service Provider network. Telephone numbers  for which a valid postal address was recovered were sent an advance  mailing informing them that they had been selected to participate in  the Knowledge Networks Panel. To conduct the survey, a sample was  drawn at random from active panel members using an implicitly  stratified systematic sample design. Information regarding the sampling process for Part 3 was not made available."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"General Public Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":34085,"dataFile":{"id":2603327,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"General Public Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Leaders Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":34085,"dataFile":{"id":2603326,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Leaders Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Small Telephone Survey of General Public","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":34085,"dataFile":{"id":2603328,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Small Telephone Survey of General Public","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
