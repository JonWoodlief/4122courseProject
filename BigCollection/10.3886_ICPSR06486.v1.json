The assessment consisted of three parts: (1)  a survey of innovative local programs designed to combat neighborhood  decay and crime conducted with the Police Executive Research Forum,  (2) a review of the literature to identify research findings on  preventing decay and crime and promising areas of future research, and  (3) the analysis of the predictive validity of alternative indicators  of community decay. Out of the third segment came the data prepared  for this data collection. Existing theories reflect considerable  disagreement over the temporal sequence between decay and crime.

The classification of a tract as a \"very high crime\" tract was based  on its crime rate compared to crime rates in other tracts in the same  city. The models use crime as the dependent variable, i.e., the  outcome of social and economic distress at prior time-points and  breakdowns in public order and violations that undermine the physical  maintenance and quality of life in the neighborhood, controlling for  earlier crime rates. The eight predictors of high crime risk used in  this study comprise four general groups. The first group is the prior  crime rate for the offense. The second group includes indicators of  breakdown in public order and the presence of illegal activity harmful  to neighborhood environment, including the drug arrest rate, the  delinquency rate, and the rate of confirmed or suspected arson  incidents. The third group reflects factors related to the maintenance  of social control by a stable population with sufficient resources and  a common interest in protecting the area. This includes an index of  family poverty, the presence of public housing, and home  ownership. The fourth group is comprised of the percentage of lots  zoned for commercial use, representing access to situations that  increase opportunities for certain crimes. Dichotomous variables were  created to compare the highest-rate tracts to all others and used as  dependent variables in the prediction equations. Because the accuracy  of prediction would vary depending on the number of tracts in the  \"very high crime\" group, alternative definitions grouped the worst  10 to 30 tracts in multiple tests of each model. To control for  differences in population and to facilitate cross-tract comparisons,  counts of crime incidents and other events were converted to rates per  1,000 residents. In Washington, DC, tract population for interim years  was estimated by using the change in city population from 1980 to 1990  to revise the 1980 tract population (average per year proportion  change in population times the number of years since 1980). Also, the  Washington, DC, data were aggregated by 1970 tract boundaries because  some agencies did not shift their geographic coding to 1980 Census  tract boundaries for several years and so did not reflect instances  where a single tract was divided into two tracts as the population  expanded. Tracts with less than 100 residents were considered  nonresidential or institutional and were deleted from the analysis. In  Washington, DC, 12 tracts were deleted and in Cleveland, 10 tracts were deleted."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Washington, DC, variables include rates for arson  and drug sales or possession, percentage of lots zoned for commercial  use, percentage of housing occupied by owners, scale of family  poverty, presence of public housing units for 1980, 1983, and 1988,  and rates for aggravated assaults, auto thefts, burglaries, homicides,  rapes, and robberies for 1980, 1983, 1988, and 1990.
