The study was a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a randomized control trial conducted within Facebook. (See \"Other References\" in \"Metadata\" for parent study information.)\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<b>Basic description of 4 anonymized data files of study participants.</b>\r\n<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> fbr_friends: Anonymized Facebook friends networks, basic ego demographics, basic ego social media activity </li>\r\n    <li> fbr_family: Anonymized Facebook family networks, basic ego demographics, basic ego social media activity </li>\r\n    <li> fbr_photos: Anonymized Facebook photo networks, basic ego demographics, basic ego social media activity </li>\r\n    <li> fbr_groups: Anonymized Facebook group networks, basic ego demographics, basic ego social media activity </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEach network comprises the ego, the ego's first degree connections, and the (second degree) connections between the ego's friends.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMissing data and users who did not have friend, family, photo, or group networks were cleaned from the data beforehand.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Each data file contains the following columns of data, taken with participant knowledge and consent </b> \r\n<br>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> participant_id: Nonidentifying ids assigned to different study participants. </li>\r\n    <li> is_smoker: Binary value (0,1) that takes on the value 1 if participant was a smoker and 0 otherwise. </li>\r\n    <li> gender: One of three categories: male, female, or blank, which signified Other (different from missing data). </li>\r\n    <li> country: One of four categories: Canada (ca), US (us),  Mexico (mx), or Other (xx). </li>\r\n    <li> likes_count: Numeric data indicating number of Facebook likes the participant had made up to the date the data was collected. </li>\r\n    <li> wall_count: Numeric data indicating number of Facebook wall posts the participant had made up to the date the data was collected. </li>\r\n    <li> t_count_page_views: Numeric data indicating number of pages participant had visited in the UbiQUITous app up to the date the data was collected. </li>\r\n   <li> yearsOld: Numeric data indicating age in years of the participant;

a network-level metric; calculated after removing ego and isolates. </li>\r\n    <li> mean_closeness: Average of how closely associated members are to one another; a network-level metric; calculated after removing ego and isolates. </li>\r\n    <li> isolates2: Number of individuals with no connections other than to the ego; a network-level metric. </li>\r\n    <li> diameter3: Maximum degree of separation between any two individuals in the network; a network-level metric; calculated after removing ego and isolates. </li>\r\n    <li> clusters3: Number of subnetworks; a network-level metric; calculated after removing ego and isolates. </li>\r\n    <li> communities3: Number of groups, sorted to increase dense connections within the group and decrease sparse connections outside it (i.e., to maximize modularity);
