For  this survey, mental health professionals were sampled from eight  professional organizations and were asked questions about their  clients during 1991. Respondents were instructed to count only those  clients whose primary reason for being treated was because they were  previously crime victims, regardless of whether the criminal  victimization was the presenting issue at the time the client was  first treated. Interviews were structured to first elicit information  about the number of victims served for each type of crime. Respondents  were then asked for details about the type and length of treatment for  the crime type most frequently encountered by the respondent.

Although much has been written in the clinical literature on the  effects of criminal victimization on the mental health of victims,  little empirical analysis has been conducted to assess the magnitude  of this problem. Although victims could be surveyed directly, victims  are often reluctant to answer questions of this nature and are not  well informed about issues such as length of treatment and the  underlying cause of mental illness. Therefore, this project was  targeted at mental health professionals instead of directly surveying  victims. The main focus of the survey was to determine the number of  crime victims receiving mental health counseling, by type of crime,  and the annual cost of treatment for each type of crime  victim. Multiplying these two figures would yield an estimate of the annual financial cost of mental health care for crime victims."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Telephone interviews were conducted by two  graduate students, both of whom had psychology and counseling  backgrounds. Respondents were given a brief overview of the survey  and asked if their practice in 1991 included the treatment of crime  victims. If the respondent did treat crime victims, the interviewee  was given the option of responding immediately or setting up a  convenient time for a future telephone interview. Respondents were  instructed that they were only to count clients whose primary reason  for being treated was because they were previously crime victims,  regardless of whether the criminal victimization was the presenting  issue at the time the client was first treated. Interviews lasted  between 15 and 40 minutes, with most requiring at least 20  minutes.

For 19 respondents,  time ran out for the interview and questions were skipped that  pertained to those crime victims least encountered by that  respondent.
