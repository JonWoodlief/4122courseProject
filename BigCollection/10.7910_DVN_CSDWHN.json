To date, however, there has been little systematic empirical study of the influence of these factors on Chinese FDI. In this study, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature. Utilizing a cross-sectional time-series data set for 66 countries for the period of 2003â€“2010, we investigate the effects of various economic and political variables on Chinese FDI in Latin America and Africa. We find that Chinese FDI is influenced by trade flows and natural resources in host economies, including oil resources and ores and metals, while also being directed to markets with lower per capita income. In addition, the study adds to the prior literature by demonstrating empirically that Chinese FDI flows are negatively associated with recipients who maintain diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The analysis also suggests that, with the exception of natural resources (oil), there is little overlap in the determinants of Chinese and US FDI."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Replication, FPA"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-23"}]}},"files":[{"label":"CFDI.2003-2010.FPA-13-Aug-0100.R2.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79410,"dataFile":{"id":2777913,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CSDWHN/PRHLY4","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CSDWHN/PRHLY4","filename":"CFDI.2003-2010.FPA-13-Aug-0100.R2.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":138555,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:152710591e4-c55691e7dd8d","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","originalFileSize":105610,"UNF":"UNF:6:n2xtfhMkvvPZmieIiHDieQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"be16455b26c482ecf91e400d02bee538","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"be16455b26c482ecf91e400d02bee538"}}},{"label":"Codebook.FPA-13-Aug-0100.R2.Revised_.doc","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79410,"dataFile":{"id":2777912,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CSDWHN/LLFS2B","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CSDWHN/LLFS2B","filename":"Codebook.FPA-13-Aug-0100.R2.Revised_.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":41984,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:152710591ea-b35f8e123515","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"37db615e8694a88cec2be6a84504653b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"37db615e8694a88cec2be6a84504653b"}}}]}}}
