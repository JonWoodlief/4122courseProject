Drawing on the social disorganizatio\nn and concentrated disadvantage literature, this study used growth-curve modeling and semi-parametric group-based trajectory modeling to: (1) assess neighborhood variation in homicide trends; (2) identify the particular types of homicide trajectory that Chicago neighborhoods follow; (3) assess whether structural characteristics of neighborhoods influence homicide trends and trajectories; and (4) determine the extent to which the influence of structural characteristics is mediated by neighborhood levels of collective efficacy.

To generate the homicide rate (per 100,000), homicide incident counts were obtained from HOMICIDES IN CHICAGO, 1965-1995 (ICPSR 6399). This dataset includes tract identifiers that allow for merging with other tract characteristics. The population sizes used in the denominator of the homicide rate were obtained from the decennial United States Census files for each decade from 1980-2000, and cubic spline interpolation was used to generate intercensal estimates. The homicide rate was calculated per 100,000 population. Due to a high degree of skewness in the homicide rate, the study analyses used the natural log of the homicide rate. One objective was to examine the relationships between homicide trends and various characteristics of neighborhood structure identified as relevant by the social disorganization perspective. These variables were drawn from the CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 1980 [UNITED STATES]: SUMMARY TAPE FILE 3A (ICPSR 8071), CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 1990 [UNITED STATES]: SUMMARY TAPE FILE 3A (ICPSR 9782), and CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 2000 [UNITED STATES]: SUMMARY FILE 3, NATIONAL (ICPSR 13396). In order to avoid the problems associated with high levels of multicollinearity among the regressors, several standardized mean indexes were created to represent key concepts identified in previous empirical and theoretical work. All predictors were incorporated as both static levels at the beginning of the time period, and as change scores for the period 1980 to 2000.</p>\n<p>As an initial attempt at determining whether the effect of these structural characteristics on neighborhood crime trends are mediated by emergent properties of neighborhoods such as social cohesion, collective efficacy, and disorder, this study also incorporated data from the PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS: COMMUNITY SURVEY, 1994-1995 (ICPSR 2766). This survey contained responses from interviews conducted with 8,782 Chicago residents comprising a representative sample for each of the 343 neighborhood clusters of Chicago. The resulting dataset includes measures such as willingness to engage in informal social control, social cohesion and trust, and social and physical disorder. The community survey was conducted in 1994-1995, so the timing was not ideal for incorporation into a study of homicide trends from 1980-2000. Therefore, this portion of the study analyses was restricted to the years 1990-2000.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables used in the study analyses include census tract, natural log of the homicide rate, neighborhood characteristics, several standardized mean indexes, and community-level measures.
