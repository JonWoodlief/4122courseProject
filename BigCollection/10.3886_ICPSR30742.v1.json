The study consists of two parts which analyze the party level for women's ascendancy to political leadership. Part 1 focuses on an aggregate of 25 non-randomly selected countries, Part 2 focuses on Lebanon. The study records the level of religiosity of political parties, where it refers to religious components in the party's political platforms or the extent to which religion penetrates a party's political agendas. Both datasets examine party variation in religiosity, party structure, respondents' station within a parties' decision-making inner structures, and other party-level characteristics that may impact women's leadership in various political parties. Additional variables include identifiers for Muslim, Arab, and European states, level of secularism, election design, party design, and age of party."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of the study was to explore the impact of political party structure on gender inequality, particularly in parliamentary representation, in the political realm as a whole. The goal of this study was to compile a dataset that looks beyond the national domestic level into the individual party-level explanatory factors for women’s political leadership, broadly defined to include their station within parties’ decision-making inner structures. The primary investigator used this data to test the theory that political institutions, mainly political parties, are the main vehicles for women’s ascendancy to political leadership. The dataset allows researchers to look at the impact of party-level characteristics and the influences they exert on women’s chances in assuming leadership positions within political parties’ inner structure.
