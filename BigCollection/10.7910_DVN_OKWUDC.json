An area probability sample was drawn, with the county as the stratification unit. The Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan conducted interviews with 2,264 subjects.<br /><br />  The questionnaires focused on various areas of one's life where problems may develop, such as marriage and family, work, and general social relationships. Participants were asked about general satisfaction and satisfaction with their marital and work roles. Questions about health; attitudes about self, work, and family; coping styles and methods; and background items were also included. Finally, the interviews contained six Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) picture projective cues. The 1976 replication includes 70% of the questions asked in 1957.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (typed TAT protocols from a random subsample).
