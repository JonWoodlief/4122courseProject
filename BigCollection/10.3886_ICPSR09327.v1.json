To assess the impact of the traumatic event, a wide variety  of clinical and psychiatric measures of psychological disorder were  employed. The data are stored in two files. Included in the first file  are variables concerning the respondent's personal characteristics  such as age, sex, ethnic origin, marital status, educational level,  relationship to deceased officer, and employment. Also included are  experiences and emotional reactions to the death of the officer and  clinical symptoms of psychological distress. The file also offers  information on the deceased officer's demographic characteristics such  as age at time of death, sex, ethnic origin, educational level, number  of times married, and number of years in law enforcement, as well as  the date and time of the incident. The second file contains variables  on the respondent's relationship with friends and relatives before and  after the traumatic event, behavioral changes of survivors' children  following the death, financial impacts on survivors, and satisfaction with treatment and responses received from police departments."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes toward death"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"grief"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police deaths"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"psychological wellbeing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
