To date, the majority of studies find no evidence of absolute\r\nconvergence, but many find evidence of conditional convergence, i.e. convergence\r\nhaving controlled for differences in technological and behavioural parameters. The\r\nlack of evidence of absolute convergence has led to claims that global income\r\ninequality is deteriorating. This is believed to be untrue. Most convergence studies\r\nare aimed at proving or disproving the neoclassical growth model and hence take the\r\n‘country’ as the unit of measurement. However, if inferences are being made about\r\nworld income distribution the focus should be on ‘people’ rather than ‘countries’ to\r\nprevent China and Luxembourg, for example, receiving equal weighting in the\r\nanalysis. The beta-convergence method and two different measures of per capita income\r\nare used and it is shown that there is indeed evidence of income divergence between\r\ncountries. However, crucially, convincing evidence is found of income convergence if\r\nthe regressions are weighted by population. Thus, it is found that poor peoples’\r\nincomes are growing faster than rich peoples’ incomes, suggesting that global income\r\ninequality is in fact improving."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-02"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Do-file","label":"Article for Applied Economics Letters (convergence).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79107,"dataFile":{"id":2769652,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RGJRST/VDRJA1","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RGJRST/VDRJA1","filename":"Article for Applied Economics Letters (convergence).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":532,"description":"Do-file","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15204df60dc-fd123f4a68bd","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fcd42f8346377793c01e3cc4eb14af91","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fcd42f8346377793c01e3cc4eb14af91"}}},{"description":"Data","label":"Article for Applied Economics Letters (convergence).tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79107,"dataFile":{"id":2769651,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RGJRST/BACVVT","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RGJRST/BACVVT","filename":"Article for Applied Economics Letters (convergence).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":22585,"description":"Data","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15204df6327-f6c75f0b1cf8","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","originalFileSize":23069,"UNF":"UNF:6:Owm05CUnTqqFxC6T9QKzow==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a63f3a5bff6b98f57e5c95d59653a17c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a63f3a5bff6b98f57e5c95d59653a17c"}}}]}}}
