The data address the following topics: (1) types of drugs used  by arrestees (based on self-reports and urinalysis), (2) self-reported  dependency on drugs, (3) self-reported need for alcohol/drug  treatment, (4) the relationship between drug use and certain types of  offenses, and (5) the relationship between self-reported indicators of  drug use and indicators of drug use based on urinalysis. Participation  in the project is voluntary, and all information collected from the  arrestees is anonymous and confidential. The data include the  arrestee's age, race, gender, educational attainment, marital status,  and the charge at the time of booking. The recently modified DUF  interview instrument (used for part of the 1995 data and all of the  1996 and 1997 data) also collected information about the arrestee's  use of 15 drugs, including recent and past use (e.g., 3-day and 30-day  drug use) of each of these drugs, age at first use, and whether the  arrestee had ever been dependent on drugs. In the original DUF  interview instrument (used for the 1987 to 1994 data and part of the  1995 data), the information collected was the same as above except  that the use of 22 drugs was queried, and the age at which the  arrestee first became dependent on the drug was included. Arrestees  also were questioned in the original instrument about their history of  intravenous drug use, whether the consideration of AIDS influenced  whether they shared needles, history of drug and alcohol treatment,  their past and current drug treatment needs, and how many persons they  had sex with during the past 12 months. Finally, arrestees were asked  to provide a urine specimen, which was screened for the pr\nesence of  ten drugs, including marijuana, opiates, cocaine, PCP, methadone,  benzodiazepines (Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene (Darvon),  barbiturates, and amphetamines (positive test results for amphetamines  were confirmed by gas chromatography). The Gun Addendum Data (Parts  27, 35, and 37) contain variables on topics such as arrestees'  encounters with guns, whether they agreed or disagreed with statements  about guns, gun possession, how they obtained handgun(s), whether they  were armed with a gun at their arrest or during crimes, and if they  had ever used a gun against another person.

Research addressing the  prevalence of drug use typically does not include the population of  offenders and therefore may underestimate levels of drug use in the  United States. The DUF program makes an important contribution to  research on the prevalence of drug use by sampling persons who are not  sampled by other surveys of drug use. Moreover, the DUF data provide  important information that may be used by law enforcement and drug  treatment officials to allocate resources, design prevention  strategies, and gauge the impact of local efforts to reduce drug  use. The following is a sample of the questions addressed by the data:  What types of drugs do arrestees use? Among arrestees reporting drug  use, how many report that they are dependent on drugs? To what extent  do arrestees report a need for alcohol/drug treatment? Is the  likelihood of drug use greater for persons arrested for certain types  of offenses? Finally, what is the relationship between self-reported drug use and indicators of drug use based on urinalysis?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The DUF program is a nonexperimental survey of  drug use among arrestees. In addition to supplying information on  self-reported drug use, at the conclusion of the interview arrestees  are asked to provide a urine specimen which is screened for the  presence of ten illicit drugs. Between 1987 and 1997 the DUF program  has collected information about drug use among arrestees in 24 sites  across the United States, although the number of data collection sites  varies slightly from year to year (see the description of the sample  below). Samples of arrestees for the DUF program are drawn from  booking facilities within each of the following sites and thus are  limited to the types of arrestees booked at these facilities. In 11  sites (Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Kansas  City, Omaha, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Washington, DC), the  catchment area represents the central city (Kansas City ceased being a  DUF site after 1992). In ten additional sites (Dallas, Ft. Lauderdale,  Indianapolis, Miami, New Orleans, Manhattan [New York City], Phoenix,  Portland, San Antonio, and San Jose), the catchment area is the  county, parish, or borough. The city of Denver is Denver County and  its entirety, and the city of St. Louis is also a county. The  catchment area for Los Angeles includes part of the city and part of  the county, and in Birmingham and San Diego the catchment area  includes the entire central city and part of the county. Each quarter,  trained local staff at these sites obtain voluntary and anonymous  urine specimens from detained arrestees who have been in a booking  facility for not more than 48 hours. The number of persons interviewed  and the demographic composition of those interviewed varies somewhat  across the 24 sites that have participated in the DUF program. On  average, each site attempts to\nobtain a sample of 225 adult males per  quarter. Data are collected from about 100 adult females each quarter  at 21 of the 24 sites. Each quarter, 12 sites collect data from  juvenile males and 8 collect data from juvenile females. Sites in  which juveniles are interviewed attempt to obtain samples of 100 boys  and 100 girls, although in many sites these quotas are not met due to  the small number of juvenile arrestees from which to draw samples. The  following procedures govern data collection in the DUF program. Male  arrestees are selected by charge according to the following order of  priority: (1) nondrug felony charges, (2) nondrug misdemeanor charges,  (3) drug felony charges, and (4) drug misdemeanor charges. Males  arrested for the following minor offenses are not sampled: vagrancy,  loitering, or traffic violations (including driving while  intoxicated). An exception to these general procedures is Omaha, where  all arrestees are surveyed. In order to obtain a sufficient sample of  adult female arrestees and juvenile arrestees, all adult female  arrestees and all juvenile male and female arrestees are surveyed  regardless of the nature of the crime for which they have been  arrested. Individuals arrested on new charges who also have  outstanding warrants are selected only on the basis of the new  charge's position in the priority list, and the outstanding warrants  are not considered. In addition to these selection criteria, sites are  requested to survey no more than 20 percent of adult males arrested  for drug offenses. To remain within the limit, the proportion of drug offenders interviewed is calculated each evening of data collection."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data include the age, race, sex, educational  attainment, marital status, employment status, and living  circumstances of a sample of persons arrested and booked in the United  States. The recently modified DUF interview instrument (used for part  of the 1995 data and all of the 1996 and 1997 data), also included  detailed questions about each arrestee's self-reported use of 15  drugs. The original DUF interview instrument (used for the 1987 to  1994 data and part of the 1995 data) elicited information about the  use of 22 drugs and the age at which the arrestee first became  dependent on the drug. For each drug type, arrestees were asked  whether they had ever used the drug, the age at which they first used  the drug, whether they had used the drug within the past three days,  how many days they had used the drug with the past month, whether they  had ever needed or felt dependent on the drug, and whether they were  dependent on the drug at the time of the interview. Data from the new  interview instrument also include information about whether arrestees  had ever injected drugs and whether they were influenced by drugs when  the police said they committed the crimes for which they were  arrested. The data also include information about whether the arrestee  had been to an emergency room for drug-related incidents and whether  he or she had prior arrests in the last 12 months. Data from the DUF  original interview instrument also include information about  arrestees' preferred method for using cocaine, how much money  arrestees spend on drugs in an average week, how many persons they had  sex with during the past 12 months, whether they ever injected drugs,  whether they injected drugs within the past six months, whether they  ever shared needles, whether they shared needles within the past six  months, and whether the consideration of AIDS influenced whether they  shared needles. Data from both versions of the DUF interview provide  information about each arrestee's history of drug/alcohol treatment,  including whether they ever received drug/alcohol treatment and  whether they needed drug/alcohol treatment. In addition to the survey,  a urine specimen provided by the arrestee was screened (by the drug  testing system EMIT) for the fo\nllowing ten drug types: marijuana,  opiates, cocaine, PCP, methadone, benzodiazepines (Valium),  methaqualone, propoxyphene (Darvon), barbiturates, and  amphetamines. All positive results for amphetamines were confirmed by  gas chromatography to eliminate positives that may be caused by  over-the-counter drugs. Finally, the following variables included in  the data were collected for use by local law enforcement officials at  each site: precinct (precinct of arrest) and law (penal law code  associated with the crime for which the subject was arrested).
