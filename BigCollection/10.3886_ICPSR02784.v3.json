Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the conflict in Kosovo. Additional questions dealing with the Kosovo intervention focused on how closely respondents\nhad followed news of the conflict, whether they favored or opposed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air strikes and the potential use of NATO ground troops, and whether the United States should do more for fleeing Kosovar refugees. On another topic, views were solicited on the threat of violence in public schools. Respondents were queried as to how safe they thought schools were, and whether more or less security was needed. Opinions were sought on the potential use of various security measures, such as stationing police officers in schools, the use of metal detectors, and random searching of student lockers. Opinions were also solicited on how serious a problem weapons in public schools were, how difficult it is to predict potentially violent students, and the role the federal government should take in ensuring safety in local schools. Particular attention was given to the April 20, 1999, school shootings in Littleton, Colorado. Respondents were asked how closely they had followed the news of that event, why they thought this incident happened, the role the Internet plays in school violence, and the likelihood for incidents like the one in Littleton to occur again. On a related topic, respondents were asked about their views toward banning assault weapons and handguns, their own households' ownership of guns, and their opinions of the National Rifle Association. Background information on respondents includes age, race, education, sex, marital status, political party, political orientation, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
