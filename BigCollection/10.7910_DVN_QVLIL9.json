Left-of-center governments tend to suffer from greater credibility problems in financial markets than right-wing governments, because they are typically believed to pursue expansionary policies and have less respect for debt obligations. Applying the conventional wisdom held as “Only Nixon can go to China,” I argue that adopting IMF programs can benefit leftist governments more than other types of governments. The logic of the Nixon paradox implies that market-oriented reforms have greater credibility when implemented by a left-of-center party, whose ideologies do not accord well with the IMF's neoliberal policies, than when implemented by a right-wing party. This is because market participants interpret the action by a leftist government as driven more by a willingness to commit to market-oriented reform than by ideological affinity. Using sovereign credit rating data for almost 90 emerging market countries from 1980 to 2004, I find robust evidence consistent with the “Nixon-Goes-to-China” hypothesis. The findings suggest that adopting IMF programs improves the perceived creditworthiness of leftist governments, whereas no such benefit is found among non-leftist governments."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ISQ 2014, Volume 58, Issue 2"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cho, Hye Jee, 2014, \"Impact of IMF Programs on Perceived Creditworthiness of Emerging Market Countries: Is There a “Nixon-Goes-to-China” Effect?\" International Studies Quarterly 58(2), 308–321:"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.1111/isqu.12063"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://doi.org/10.1111/isqu.12063"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-06-11"}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[]}},"files":[{"label":"cho_isq.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":131266,"categories":["Code"],"dataFile":{"id":3087805,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/QVLIL9/7LCBEU","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QVLIL9/7LCBEU","filename":"cho_isq.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":1650,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:160333408c2-c000a9438ee2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a4a72731b19f34d3cb9e9eb6aa3841fc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a4a72731b19f34d3cb9e9eb6aa3841fc"}}},{"label":"cho_isq.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131266,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":3087804,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/QVLIL9/YHVQOF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QVLIL9/YHVQOF","filename":"cho_isq.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":297408,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16033341026-eaa18a2b63cd","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata-13","originalFormatLabel":"Stata 13 Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:cdvpfV3S4K34sh5g58AzXQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"afe177d19ea3539b6a8125f85bbbfb48","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"afe177d19ea3539b6a8125f85bbbfb48"}}},{"label":"supporting information.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":131266,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":3087806,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/QVLIL9/53EJTM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QVLIL9/53EJTM","filename":"supporting information.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":163438,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:160333417e1-51dff7ce0924","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"11f5929533a50fa88ec8146831d98f86","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"11f5929533a50fa88ec8146831d98f86"}}}]}}}
