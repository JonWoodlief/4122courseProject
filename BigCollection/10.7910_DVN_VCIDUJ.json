Identify beliefs to reinforce and beliefs to change related to safer injecting and sexual behaviors b. Build one or more character archetypes c. Identify current strategies used by IDUs to overcome obstacles to safe injecting d. Describe the openings when, where, and by whom IDUs can be communicated with e. Describe IDUsÂ past experiences with the safe injecting and alternative behaviors. Describe the level of knowledge and sophistication with which IDUs approach decisions about safe injecting g. Understand current prevention perceptions related to HIV prevention and associations. Six IDU participants were recruited in each of the 4 geographic areas where the study was conducted. Due to the sensitive nature of recruiting and accessing IDUs, local staff and peer educators who are working with the target group on a daily basis assisted in recruiting respondents. Persons identified as po-tential respondents were first assessed to ensure that they meet with the inclusion criteria for the study. A total 24 IDUs were recruited for this study. Two interviewers with previous experience collecting qualita-tive data were recruited and trained to participate in the study. The study received approval from PSI Re-search Ethics Board. Experienced interviewers from IPSOS Thailand Limited used a discussion guide prepared by PSI/Thailand Research team to conduct the interviews. The interview was separated into 2 sessions. In the first session, each respondent completed part one of discussion guide, asked to tell a story about drug use behavior, needle and syringe exchange and\nVCT testing service. The second session con-ducted with completion of part two of discussion guide. He/She was asked about sexual behavior, STI testing and anticipated probes were used to collect as much detail about each of the relationships as possible."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Qualitative"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In-depth interview"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV/AIDS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IDU"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV risk behaviors"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"BCC"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Global Fund"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Thailand (2009): FoQus Research Study Conducted with Injecting Drug Users in Bangkok, Trang, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI/Thailand"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://psi.org/resources/research"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"PSI"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.psi.org/sites/default/themes/psi/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-01-26"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Thailand"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"IDU FoQus Report EN V5 FINAL-1.pdf","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51466,"categories":["report, dashboards"],"dataFile":{"id":2339625,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"IDU FoQus Report EN V5 FINAL-1.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":853816,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:79693","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"feccba47b7613fc83f56e565a489e132","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"feccba47b7613fc83f56e565a489e132"}}},{"description":"","label":"Thailand 2009 - Safer Injecting and Sexual Behaviors amoung IDUs in Thailand - Study Design.doc","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51466,"categories":["study design"],"dataFile":{"id":2339624,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Thailand 2009 - Safer Injecting and Sexual Behaviors amoung IDUs in Thailand - Study Design.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":781824,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:79694","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"82cd5bd8319e7bfc89b4136675c5c720","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"82cd5bd8319e7bfc89b4136675c5c720"}}}]}}}
