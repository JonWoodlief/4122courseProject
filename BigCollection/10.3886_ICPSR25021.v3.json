Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on globalization and on the European Union (EU), including how well-informed they were about the EU, what sources of information about the EU they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EU member (or would benefit from being a future member), and the extent of their personal interest in EU matters. Other questions queried respondents about their country's public administration, the transparency of both their own government institutions and those of the EU, and how important they thought transparency was in t\nheir functioning. Respondents were asked which countries, specifically Turkey, Croatia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, they would favor joining the EU. National and European identity is a major focus of the survey. Questions focused on to what extent respondents felt they were a citizen of their region, of their country, of Europe, and of the world, whether they were content with their identity, and their feelings on the importance of being European. The second major focus of the survey was European elections. Respondents were queried about their interest in the elections, whether or not they would vote, the main criteria in making these decisions, and what themes the electoral campaign should focus on.  In addition, respondents were asked to name the party they voted for in the European Parliament (EP) elections in June 2004, May 2007, November 2007, and the latest parliamentary elections in their respective countries. For the third major focus, European values and value priorities, respondents were asked to identify their personal values, whether they thought EU member states shared common values, and how close or distant these shared values were. In addition, respondents were asked to select the most important values they associated with the idea of happiness. For the final major focus of the survey, climate change, respondents were queried about their knowledge of and views on climate change, including whether they thought climate change was a serious problem, whether enough is being done to fight it, and the reasons why individuals may or may not take action in fighting climate change. Respondents were also asked to identify the personal actions they have taken regarding climate change and to evaluate the objectives proposed by the EU to limit the impact of climate change.

Further addresses (every Nth address) were selected by standard \"random route\" procedures, from the initial address. In each household, the respondent was drawn, at random (following the \"closest birthday rule\"). All interviews were conducted face-to-face in people's homes and in the appropriate national language.
