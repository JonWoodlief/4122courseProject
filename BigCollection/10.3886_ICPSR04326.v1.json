Respondents were queried on such topics as Social Security  benefits, parenthood, young people joining the military, capital  punishment, same-sex marriage, stem cell research, and whether  abortion should be legal in all cases. Respondents were asked how  President George W. Bush was handling his presidency, the economy, the  situation in Iraq, and the United States campaign against terrorism.

Questions asked included their feelings about the selection of  Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as pope, whether they approved or  disapproved of the selection, if they thought he should maintain the  traditional policies of the Church, and what should be his highest  priority (e.g., responding to the concerns of women in the Church,  encouraging human rights, or addressing the issue of sexual abuse by  priests). Other questions included whether the Roman Catholic Church  was in touch with the views of Catholics in America, whether the  respondent would want their son to become a priest, and whether they  would support the Catholic Church denying communion to Catholic  politicians who are in favor of legal abortion.</p>\n\n<p>Demographic variables include race, gender, age, level of  education, income,
