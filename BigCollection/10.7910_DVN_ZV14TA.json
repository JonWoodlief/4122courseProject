Hybrid rice has the potential to grow in dry-seeded conditions and can perform well even if seeds can be planted at low seedling rates. A field study was conducted in the wet season of 2011 and dry season of 2012 to evaluate the effect of plant-to plant spacing (10 or 20 cm), the number of rice seeds planted per spacing (2 or 3), and weed control methods (42 days weedy, weed-free, and oxadiazon followed by penoxsulam + cyhalofop) on the growth and yield of rice under a dry-seeded rice system. The crop was planted at 20-cm row spacing. Herbicide-treated plots had fewer rice plants than the 42 days weedy and weed-free plots when rain occurred before crop emergence. However, the herbicide treatment provided 81-93% better weed control than the 42 days weedy treatment, which resulted in 54-125% yield advantages over no weeding for 42 days. Grain yield in the herbicide-treated plots was only 75-88% of the grain yield in the weed free plots, suggesting further scope to improve rice yield in dry-seeded systems. Grain yield was similar across plant-to-plant spacing and the number of seeds planted per spacing. Our study suggests that hybrids can be grown at low seeding rates at 20-cm plant-to-plant spacing, provided there is no herbicide phytotoxicity on crop emergence and rice plant density is uniform. These results may help manufacturers in designing sowing drills with precise seed-metering systems for dry-seeded rice systems in Asia."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Earth and Environmental Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Dry seeding"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"weed control"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"herbicide"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hybrid"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Asia"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: Pest management  Type: Sustainable rice production theme  Notes: Weed Science;"},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Field Crops Research"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Opeña, Jhoana"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-09-11"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Philippines"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["IRRI ES Block UX"]}]}},"files":[{"label":"HANDSEEDING 2011WS- 2012 DS.xls","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":76347,"categories":["Documentation, Raw data, Processed data and Statistical analysis "],"dataFile":{"id":2445339,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"HANDSEEDING 2011WS- 2012 DS.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":179712,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:120332","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7e8f2ff8207d2151ffe0ef99b43ce0d8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7e8f2ff8207d2151ffe0ef99b43ce0d8"}}}]}}}
