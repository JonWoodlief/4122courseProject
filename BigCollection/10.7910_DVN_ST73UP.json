The financial press has concluded that “the argument for central bank independence...appears overwhelming,” and many nations have made their central banks more independent during the 1990s. Even the new monetary union now being established in Europe is organized around a central bank designed to be highly independent of political control (Goodhart 1995; Fratianni and von Hagen 1992; Gros and Thygesen 1992).\n<br /><br />\r \r The argument for central bank independence rests on three pillars. First, a body of\r economic theory has been developed to explain why the independence of the central bank enhances economic performance (Persson and Tabellini 1994; Cukierman 1992). Second, several national cases are cited to support this view, of which the most prominent is the Federal Republic of Germany whose Bundesbank also provides the model for the new European Central Bank (Canzoneri, Grilli, and Masson 1993\n; Fratianni, von Hagen, and Waller 1992). Third, an influential set of empirical studies seems to confirm that, by making the central bank more independent, a nation can secure lower rates of inflation without any adverse economic effects (Alesina and Summers 1993; Grilli, Masciandaro, and Tabellini 1991).\n<br /><br />\r The object of this chapter is to question the current consensus in favor of central bank\r independence. We proceed by examining each of the pillars on which the case for it rests, beginning with the theoretical rationale, following with a reconsideration of the German case, and concluding with the reanalysis of cross-national data. We close by discussing the implications for economic performance under European Monetary Union."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Robert J.
