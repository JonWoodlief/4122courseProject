CD4 tests were performed on venous blood among the sub-sample of participants who visited the laboratory.\r\n\r\n* The HIV screening and confirmatory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays used were the Vironostika HIV 1/2 Ag/Ab MicroELISA System (BioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and the Roche Cobas E411 Combi Ag, respectively. \r\n* The viral load platform was BioMérieux NucliSens with a lower limit of detection of 100 copies by DBS.\r\n* Testing for exposure to either emtricitabine (FTC) or lamivudine (3TC) was performed at the Pharmacokinetic Laboratory at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. A semiquantitative LC/MS/MS assay with a lower limit of detection of 0.02 mg/mL was validated for the determination of 3TC and FTC from DBS. The method consisted of a protein precipitation, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with MS/MS detection using gradient elution.
