Section A:  Evaluation of the socio-economic and demographic status of the households; Section B: Evaluation of the household food insecurity; Section C: Evaluation of contribution of forest foods to the food diversity of the households through a 24 h recall; Section D: Evaluation the food frequency consumption of the various groups of food; Section E: Evaluation of knowledge, attitudes and practical of the forest inhabitants.  In each village, 20-22 households took part.\r\nAfter this first phase of interview, three quarterly follow-ups were carried out in each interviewed households each 3 months with the questionnaire of the section C.        \r\nNutrient Analysis\r\nAfter the first phase of the interviews, a list of forest food consumed was selected for nutrient analysis. At the second phase, the selected fruits were collected. The mature fresh fruits and nuts per species, were sampled from different points and collected in a perforated plastic container, labeled and kept in an ice box container and transported to the laboratory at Yaoundé I University in Cameroon for analyses. At the laboratory, the samples were washed thoroughly with deionized water and conserved in a refrigerator at 4°C. For each fruit species, two fruits out of the three per village were randomly selected for edible pulp extraction. The pulp from the fruits and nuts were mashed in a blender. Extracted edible pulps per species were divided into two sub samples. For the ﬁrst sub sample, the extracted fresh pulp was immediately sealed in clean polyethylene bags and conserved at −20°C and later used for vitamin, bioactive compound and anti-nutrient analysis, while the other sub sample was analyzed for moisture content. The dried samples were conserved for proximate analysis. \r\n "}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":" NON-WOOD FOREST PRODUCTS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FORESTS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FOODS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FOOD COMPOSITION"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HUMAN NUTRITION"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LOGGING"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LICENSES"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LOCAL COMMUNITIES"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Fungo, R.; Muyonga, J.; Kaaya, A.; Okia, C.; Tieguhong, J.C.; Baidu-Forson, J.J.
