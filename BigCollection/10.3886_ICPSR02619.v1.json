For the study, adults aged 17 years  and over living in Great Britain (excluding Scotland north of the  Caledonian Canal) were surveyed over four waves. Wave A, fielded  during spring/summer 1996, consisted of personal interviews with 3,662  respondents. Subsequent waves were conducted through telephone  interviews. Wave B, fielded April 1-16, 1997, consisted of interviews  with 1,800 respondents, while Wave C, fielded April 17-30, 1997,  consisted of interviews with 1,809 respondents. Wave D, conducted  during May 1997 after the 1997 election, interviewed 2,047  respondents.
