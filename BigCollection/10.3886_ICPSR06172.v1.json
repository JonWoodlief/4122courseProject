The  original Repeat Complaint Address Policing (RECAP) experiment was a  field study of the strategy of problem-oriented policing, which used  control and treatment groups consisting of specific addresses in the  city of Minneapolis. The impact of problem-oriented policing was  measured by comparing the number of 911 calls received for each  address during a baseline period to the number received during a  period when experimental treatments were in effect. Several features  of the original data distort the one-to-one correspondence between a  911 call and an event, such as the occurrence of multiple versions of  the same call in the databases. The current study identifies and  attempts to correct these occurrences by applying multiple levels of  data cleaning procedures to the original data to establish a better one-to-one call-to-event correspondence."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study reexamines REPEAT COMPLAINT ADDRESS  POLICING: TWO FIELD EXPERIMENTS IN MINNEAPOLIS, 1985-1987 (ICPSR  9788), conducted by the Minneapolis Police Department and Lawrence W.

It used individual geographic addresses in  the city of Minneapolis as the unit of analysis and compiled a  database from archived 911 computer tapes created by the Minneapolis  Emergency Communications Center (MECC). Addresses were then ranked  according to the frequency with which they appeared in the database.  Five hundred addresses were chosen for the experiment and were  randomly assigned to control and experimental groups, each consisting  of 125 commercial and 125 residential addresses. The current study  identifies three types of distortion in the original databases: True  Mirrors, Contemporaneous Calls, and Migrating Calls. True Mirrors are  multiple versions of a single call that are created by the  idiosyncrasies of the MECC computer system. Contemporaneous Calls are  multiple calls to MECC regarding a single event. Migrating Calls are  calls that are associated with one address, but then are reassigned to  another address, while the original address remains in the  database. The data in this study are recreations of the original RECAP  databases, which were then modified. (The actual databases of the  original study were not available, and consequently it was necessary  to reconstruct them.) The sixteen data files are organized such that  each file corresponds to either an \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", or \"D\" level  of data cle\naning. Each file contains either commercial or residential  addresses from either the baseline or experimental years. The \"A\"  level data is a close approximation of the databases used in the  original RECAP study. The \"B\" level data is a subset of the \"A\"  level data created by deleting True Mirrors. The \"C\" level data are  a subset of the \"B\" level data without concurrent calls regarding a  single event. The \"D\" level data contain only dispatched calls to an address."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The sixteen data files use the same  variables.
