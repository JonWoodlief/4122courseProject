Sp\necific aims were: (1) To establish national baseline estimates for various indicators of smoking cessation activity among this age group for comparison with future surveys on the same topic; (2) To describe their natural history of quitting in a nationally representative sample; and (3) To develop statistical models predicting: making a quit attempt, maintaining abstinence, and selecting various quitting strategies. Respondents were interviewed at baseline, six-month follow-up, twelve-month follow-up, and 24-month follow-up. Topics covered by the questionnaires include smoking and use of other tobacco products; attitudes towards smoking and nicotine replacement therapy; patterns of quitting and discontinuance; methods of quitting and reasons for not quitting; lifestyle (alcohol use, physical activity level, weight loss, risk orientation, school performance, movie viewing); psychosocial issues (perceived stress, depressive symptoms, Attention-Deficit Disorder/Attention-Deficit Hyperactive Disorder); smoking environment including parents'/guardians' smoking behaviors, quit attempts, and attitudes about the respondent's smoking; and tobacco marketing (use of or interest in promotional items and awareness of advertisements).
