The data files can be linked using the Commission ID  (CID). In the Records Data (Part 1), the CID is unique. In the Offense  Data (Part 2), one CID can have multiple offenses. (2) The unit of  analysis is determined by the user but could include: (a) Judicial  proceeding: a proceeding in which all offenses for which the offender  was convicted were pending before the court for sentencing at the same  time. (b) Transaction: a crime or crimes committed by an  offender at a single time or in temporally continuous actions that were  part of the same episode, event, or incident, or which were conspiracy  and the offense that was conspired to. There can be multiple  transactions within one judicial proceeding. (c) Offense: there can be  multiple offenses within one transaction. (3) These data represent the  public version of the 1996 sentencing data for which three  confidential variables (offender's name, Social Security number,  judge's name) were removed from the dataset before submission to ICPSR  and three additional variables (docket number, offense tracking  number, and state identification number) were blanked by  ICPSR. Information on obtaining the full dataset is provided in the  codebook. (4) The codebook and data collection instruments are  provided by ICPSR as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
