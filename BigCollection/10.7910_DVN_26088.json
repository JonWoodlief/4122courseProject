Given these challenges, availability of highly productive seed sources would be important to enable farmers to produce leaf fodder in sufficient quantities. 14 accessions of Acacia angustissima were evaluated for leaf, wood and total biomass production at two subtropical sites with uni-modal rainfall in Zimbabwe, with the objective of identifying high leaf biomass yielding accessions. There were up to fourfold difference in biomass yield between the accessions. Leaf dry matter yield ranged from 1.65 to 8.81 Mg ha-1 and 3.7 to 12.4 Mg ha-1 for wood biomass at the higher altitude site (1530 m a.s.l.) but were much lower at 1272 m a.s.l. where they ranged between 0.37 and 4.88 Mg ha-1 for leaf and 0.4 and 7.2 Mg ha-1 for wood. The most productive accessions for leaf biomass were 16231 and 18579 at the higher altitude site, while 18586 and 18501 had the highest yields at the lower altitude. Although no one accession was consistently high yieldin\ng across the two sites, the least productive accessions were consistently poor at both sites. The advantage of using selected superior accessions over the unselect bulk seed was up to 85%. These findings underscore the need to promote the use of only high yielding accessions rather than unselect bulk seed. This study identified new, more productive accessions of A. angustissima that potentially widens the genetic base of the germplasm assembled in Zimbabwe."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Leaf biomass"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Accession"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Acacia angustissima"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"African Journal of Biotechnology Vol. 11(91), pp. 15763-15770, 13 November, 2012 Available online at http://www.academicjournals.org/AJB DOI: 10.5897/AJB11.972 ISSN 1684 to 5315Â©2012 Academic Journals"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.5897"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://academicjournals.org/article/article1380797971_Nyoka%20et%20al.pdf"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/worldagroforestry.org.agrof/files/agroforests_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2003"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/worldagroforestry.org.agrof/files/agroforests_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-05-22"},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["soils data"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Zimbabwe"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Acacia angustissima provenance trial data - 2003 at Henderson & Domdoshava.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":60888,"categories":["1. data file"],"dataFile":{"id":2467548,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/26088/CISGKP","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/26088/CISGKP","filename":"Acacia angustissima provenance trial data - 2003 at Henderson & Domdoshava.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":80896,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:196301","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ebae2b41d234791b257da403c5513734","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ebae2b41d234791b257da403c5513734"}}},{"description":"","label":"Disclaimer.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":60888,"categories":["0. disclaimer"],"dataFile":{"id":2467547,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/26088/3TMLI4","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/26088/3TMLI4","filename":"Disclaimer.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":218935,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:196299","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f876174a62c66ad334a0109b2a23c529","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f876174a62c66ad334a0109b2a23c529"}}}]}}}
