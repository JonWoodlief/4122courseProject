The first wave of data was collected in 1980 (ICPSR 7896) and the third wave was collected in 1984 (ICPSR 8443). Student identification numbers included in each record permit data from these surveys to be merged with other High School and Beyond files. The base-year (1980) study incorporated student data from both cohorts into one file. Due to the more complex design of the First Follow-Up and a resulting increase in the volume of available data, separate files have been created for the two cohorts. The sophomore cohort portion of this collection replicates nearly all of the types of data gathered in the base-year study (ICPSR 7896), including students' behavior and experiences in the secondary school setting, outside employment, educational and occupational aspirations and expectations, personal and family background, and personal attitudes and beliefs. Also, the same cognitive test was administered in the base-year and follow-up surveys. The senior cohort portion, in contrast, emphasizes postsecondary education and work experiences. Education data include the amount and type of school completed, school financing, aspirations, and non-school training. Information is also provided on labor force participation and aspirations, military service, and financial status. The senior cohort did not take the cognitive test for the follow-up survey. Both cohorts provide demographic data such as age, race, sex, and ethnic background. The Transcripts Survey provides information on individual students such as the type of high school program, the student's grade point average, attendance, class rank and size, and participation in special education programs, plus course-oriented data such as the year a course was taken, the type of course, credit earned, and grades received. The Offerings and Enrollments Survey file contains data on each school in the sample and include variables such as size and type of institution, type of schedule used, ethnic composition of the faculty and student body, busing, types of programs and specific courses offered, school facilities, number of handicapped students, and school staffing. In addition, information is provided on academic and disciplinary policies, and perceived problems in the school. The Local Labor Marke\nt Indicators file contains economic and labor market data for the geographical area of each school in the sample, given both by county and by Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. The School Questionnaire file incorporates data elements from both the Base-Year School Questionnaire and the First Follow-up School Questionnaire, along with other information from sampling files, into a single record for each school. Topics include institutional characteristics such as total enrollment, average daily attendance rates, dropout rates, remedial programs, provisions for handicapped and disadvantaged students, participation in federal programs, teacher retention and absenteeism, per-pupil expenditures, school rules and policies, and ownership and funding of nonpublic schools."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic

Within each   school, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were randomly chosen. For the   First Follow-Up, the National Opinion Research Center attempted to   survey all 1980 sophomores and a subsample of 1980 seniors who   participated in the base-year survey. Supplementary questionnaires were   utilized for those 1980 sophomores who were not currently attending any   school, had transferred to other schools, or had graduated early. The   Transcripts Survey includes every secondary-school course taken by a   sub-sample of the sophomore cohort. The Course Offerings and   Enrollments Survey contains data from schools that were selected as   first-stage sample units (clusters) for the sampling of students in the   base-year survey, and in which sophomore High School and Beyond   students were actively enrolled during the 1981-1982 academic year. For   the Local Labor Market Indicators file, economic variables were derived   from data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of   Economic Analysis. For the School Questionnaire file, follow-up data   were requested from all base-year schools that were still in existence   as independent institutions and that had members of the 1980 sophomore   cohort currently enrolled. Follow-up data were not collected from   schools that had closed, merged with other schools, or had no 10th or   12th grade students during the base year, nor from schools to which   students transferred as individuals. However, in 17 instances students   from a base-year school were transferred en masse to a new school, and   school questionnaires were sought from these new schools. These 17   schools do not have weights as their selection probabilities are  unknown."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Course Offerings and Enrollments CSSC
