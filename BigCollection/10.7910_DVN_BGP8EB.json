<a href=\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28United_States%29\">medicare\n</a> is the u.s. government program that provides health insurance to 50 million elderly and disabled americans. the basic stand alone medicare claims public use files (bsapufs) contain either person- or event-level data on <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/Inpatient_Claims.html\">inpatient stays</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/BSA_DME_Line_Items_PUF.htm\nl\">durable medical equipment purchases</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/BSA_PDE_PUF.html\">prescription drug fills</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/Hospice_Bene.html\">hospice users</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/Carrier_Line_Items.html\">doctor visits</a>, <a href=\"http://ww\nw.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/HHA_PUF.html\">home health provision\n</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/Outpatient_Proc.html\">outpatient hospital procedures</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/SNF_Bene_PUF.html\">skilled nursing facility short-term residents</a>, as well as aggregated statistics for <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/Chronic_Conditions_P\nUF.html\">medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/IPBS_PUF.html\">medicare beneficiaries living in nursing homes</a>. oh sorry, there's one catch: they only provide sas scripts to analyze everything. cue the villian music. that bored old game of monopoly ends today.<br /> <br /> the initial release of the 2008 bsapufs was accompanied by <a href=\"http://academyhealth.org/Training/Re\nsourceDetail.cfm?itemnumber=7097\">some major fanfare in the world of health policy\n</a>, a big win for government transparency. unfortunately, the final files that cleared the confidentiality hurdles are heavily de-identified and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_%28software%29\">obfuscated</a>. prime examples:<br /> <ul>   <li>none of the files can be linked to any other file. not across years, not across expenditure categories</li>   <li>costs are rounded to the nearest fifth or tenth dollar at lower values, nearest thousandth at higher values</li>   <li>ages\nare categorized into five year bands</li> </ul> so these files are baldly inferior to the unsquelched, linkable data only available through <a href=\"http://www.resdac.org/cms-data/request/research-identifiable-files\">an expensive formal application process</a>. any researcher with a budget flush enough to afford a sas license (the only statistical software mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/Downloads/2008_BSA_Carrie\nr_Line_Items_PUF_DUG.zip\">the cms official documentation</a>) can probably also cough up the money to buy the identifiable data through <a href=\"http://resdac.org/\">resdac</a> (resdac, btw, rocks).<br /> <br /> soapbox:<br /> <br /> cms released free public data sets that could only be analyzed with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=how+much+does+sas+cost\">a software package costing thousands of dollars</a>. so even though the actual data sets were free, researchers still needed deep pock\nets to buy <a href=\"http://sas.com/\">sas</a>. meanwhile, the un<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_%28software%29\">squelched</a> and therefore superior data sets are also available for many thousands of dollars. researchers with funding would (reasonably) just buy the better data. researchers without any financial resources - the target audience of free, public data - were left out in the cold. no wonder these bsapufs haven't been used much.<br /> <br /> that ends now. using r, <a\nhref=\"http://monetdb.org/\">monetdb</a>, and the personal computer you already own (mine cost $700 in 2009), researchers can, for the first time, seriously analyze these medicare public use files without spending another dime. woah. plus hey guess what all you researcher fat-cats with your federal grant streams and your proprietary software licenses: r + monetdb runs one heckuva lot faster than sas. woah^2. dump your sas license water wings and learn how to swim. the scripts below require monetdb\n. <a href=\"https://github.com/ajdamico/usgsd/blob/master/MonetDB/monetdb%20installation%20instructions.R\">click here for step-by-step instructions of how to install it on windows</a> and <a href=\"http://www.asdfree.com/2013/03/column-store-r-or-how-i-learned-to-stop.html\">click here for speed tests</a>. vroom.<br /> <br /> since the bsapufs comprise 5% of the medicare population, ya generally need to multiply any counts or sums by twenty. although the individuals represented in these claims are\nrandomly sampled, this data should not be treated like a <a href=\"http://www.jstatsoft.org/v09/a08/paper\">complex survey sample</a>, meaning that the creation of a <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/survey/html/svydesign.html\">survey object</a> is unnecessary. most bsapufs generalize to either the total or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee-for-service\">fee-for-service</a> medicare population, but each file is different so give the documentation a hard stare before that eureka\nmoment. this new github repository contains three scripts:<br /> <br /> <b>2008 -
