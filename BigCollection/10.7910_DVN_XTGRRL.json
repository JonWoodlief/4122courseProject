This involved conducting research study   to identify the effects of the IAR4D approach and its different components in designing and implementing research targeted at the interface of processes driving productivity gains, efficient use of resources, the care of the environment, policies and markets that would increase demonstrably the delivery of the benefits to end users and have an impact and do so in a scientific, statistically-based manner.  IAR4D is an action research approach for investigating and facilitating the organization of groups of stakeholders (including researchers) to innovate more effectively in response to changing complex agricultural and natural resources management contexts, in order to achieve developmental outcomes. At the core of this organization is the establishment of innovation platforms . The objective of this was to characterize the various villages in order to be able to compare them with each other and conduct Baseline at village level on those aspects that we think might change under influence of the IAR4D activities in order to be able to compare the situation before and after the project. This was conducted in three countries, Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IAR4D"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Innovation platform"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Baseline survey"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Baraka, Paul"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-06-04"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Disclaimer.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":70300,"categories":["0.
