Inclusion criteria were: 1) men >45 years, and 2) nocturia ≥2 confirmed by a three-day voiding diary. Subjects were divided into non-bothering and bothering groups based on International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Nocturia (ICIQ-N) question 2b. Changes in voiding symptoms, frequency of nocturia, and bothersomeness were evaluated with international prostate symptom score (IPSS), ICIQ-N, and three-day voiding diary at 4 and 12 weeks after treatment.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nA total of 48 patients in the non-bothering nocturia group and 50 patients in the bothering nocturia group who completed the 12-week treatment were analyzed. The total IPSS was decreased by 5.8 in the non-bothering group and 5.2 in the bothering group. There was no significant difference in decrease of IPSS between the two groups. Both groups showed significant reduction in discomfort of nocturia. The ICIQ-N 2b score decreased from 3.9 to 2.7 (p=0.01) in the non-bothering group and from 6.9 to 4.6 (p=0.02) in the bothering group. The number of nocturia episodes was significantly decreased in both groups.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nRegardless of discomfort associated with nocturia, both groups showed significant improvement in nocturia-related discomfort and voiding symptoms. These results suggest that patients with nocturia who were unaware of its discomfort benefited from treatment."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-05-17"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Park, Hyun Jun"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-03"}]}},"files":[{"label":"야간뇨 raw data.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":140903,"dataFile":{"id":3213278,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/LRULQC/P1SK3R","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LRULQC/P1SK3R","filename":"야간뇨 raw data.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":299419,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1659eeccad1-7d700f8e39bf","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"25b727ff945e1298c113352e1514dfee","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"25b727ff945e1298c113352e1514dfee"}}}]}}}
