Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the  project examined how Medicare beneficiaries responded to the  implementation of the Medicare+Choice provisions of the Balanced  Budget Act of 1997. Among their multiple objectives, the  Medicare+Choice provisions sought to expand substantially the types of  coverage choices available to Medicare beneficiarie\ns and to encourage  beneficiaries to think more actively about these choices. The  Medicare+Choice Survey interviewed a sample of Medicare beneficiaries  about their basic knowledge of Medicare, current Medicare coverage  options, sources of supplemental insurance coverage, satisfaction with  current coverage, reasons for the most recent change in Medicare  coverage or lack of change since September 15, 1999, sources of  information used to make their coverage choices, and salience of the  choice and its most relevant considerations. Additional information  collected by the survey included the respondent's health and functional  status, age, sex, marital status, race, Hispanic origin, education,  reading ability, household income and the number of people supported by that income, and language spoken at home."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicare"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
