The present study assessed the prevalence and associated risk factors of under-five children diarrheal disease Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Soddo town, Southern Ethiopia. Nine hundred seventy (970) mothers/ care takers of index under-five children living in the households selected by systematic random sampling from Kebeles in the town constituted the study population. Data were collected using structured and pre-tested questionnaire, entered into a computer, edited and cleaned by using Epi info version 3.5.4 and analyzed using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Binary logistic regression model was used to calculate the Odds ratios and 95% confidence interval for the different risk factors and the level of significance was set at P < 0.05.\r\nOut of 970 sampled mother/caretaker-child pairs, 954 participated in the study and giving a response rate of 98.4%. The mean ages of the respondents and the index children were 27.62 (+5.03SD) years and 26.41(+15.89 SD) months, respectively. Prevalence of diarrheal disease over a period of two weeks preceding the study was about 11%. In the Bivariate analysis, a number of risk factors including monthly income less than five hundred birr and age of the child (P<0.05) appeared to be significantly associated with under-five childhood diarrheal disease and number of siblings under 5 years in a household, monthly income less than 500Birr and the age 12-23 months of the child were the only significant variables on multivariate analyses (P< 0.05). As diarrheal disease was major problem among under-five children in Soddo town. Appropriate intervention programs targeting Child birth spacing and improving the monthly income of households should be designed."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-11"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Ethiopia"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"3"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2/2015"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"research article"}]}},"files":[{"description":"May-August 2015 Issue (Vol 3, No 2/2015)","label":"The Prevalence of Diarrheal Disease in under Five Children and associated Risk Factors in Wolitta Soddo Town, Southern, Ethiopia.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88801,"dataFile":{"id":2917452,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/A798XX/ZDRQXT","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/A798XX/ZDRQXT","filename":"The Prevalence of Diarrheal Disease in under Five Children and associated Risk Factors in Wolitta Soddo Town, Southern, Ethiopia.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":875620,"description":"May-August 2015 Issue (Vol 3, No 2/2015)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15854a41bb1-0198dc6811ba","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"762cc044b489a96ce4e96cf865e598e3","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"762cc044b489a96ce4e96cf865e598e3"}}}]}}}
