However, the costs of these two methods have not been compared. Here, cost-minimization analysis of the 2 methods was performed, based on all charges for the overall procedures in an out-patient clinic in Castilla y León, Spain. In conclusion, the medical treatment of first-trimester abortion with misoprostol is a cost-efficient alternative to surgical treatment. Given its demonstrable safety, effectiveness and tolerance, it is a reasonable therapeutic option and should be prioritized in evacuation curettage in patients who meet the treatment criteria."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medical versus surgical treatment of first trimester spontaneous abortion: a cost-minimization analysis.
