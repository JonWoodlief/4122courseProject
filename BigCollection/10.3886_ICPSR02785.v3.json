Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, foreign policy, and the economy, as well as their views on United States and NATO involvement in the Kosovo war between the Albanians and the S\nerbs. Respondents were asked how long they estimated the air strikes on Kosovo would continue, if they would favor or oppose sending United States ground troops to Kosovo, and if the United States and NATO should negotiate a compromise with President Slobodan Milosevic to end the fighting in Yugoslavia. Regarding the high school shootings in Littleton, Colorado, respondents were queried as to whether Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold's parents should be held accountable for their children's actions, and if parents in general should be held accountable for their children's crimes. Parents of teens were asked if they thought their teenager's high school was safe. Views were also sought on whether teens need more supervision today, if parents should monitor teens' activities on the Internet, if parents should know with who and where teens spend their time, and if teens have a right to their own privacy. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, political party, political orientation, voter participation history, marital status, age of children in household, family income, and computer access."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
