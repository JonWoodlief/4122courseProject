Questions included the respondent's   opinion on what the most important problem facing the United States   was and approval ratings for President Clinton's handling of the   presidency, the economy, foreign affairs, crime, and health care.   Approval ratings were also tallied for the United States Congress and   the Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Respondents were asked how   much Congress had accomplished in the past year compared to years   before and who was responsible (i.e., President Clinton or the   parties in Congress). Respondents were asked if they believed certain   political figures, including President Clinton, Senate Majority   Leader Bob Dole, and the respondent's representative in Congress,   were doing what was best for the country, their district, or their   own political lives. Those polled were asked what they believed their   representative in Congress should or should not be doing, and which   political party was better at handling issues such as the economy and   helping the middle class. Queries included the general functioning of   the federal government and what, if any, changes were needed.   Respondent opinions on the crime bill were gathered, as well as   approval ratings on Congress's handling of the health care system.   Other questions concerning health care included whether the   respondent supported proposed changes to the health care system and   whether the respondent believed that significant improvements would   be made to the health care system. Respondents were also queried on   what changes they would like to see in Congress -- for example,   whether they would vote for their incumbent representative or the   challenger. Respondents were asked if they believed that America's   vital interests were at stake in the situation in Cuba and/or in   Haiti and whether the United States should end its economic embargo   against Cuba if certain conditions were met. Questions also solicited   respondent views on whether they would support a military invasion of   Haiti and if they believed that the United States would go to war   with Haiti. Respondents' knowledge of bills passed in Congress within   the past year was also assessed. Demographic information gathered   includes political affiliation, voter registration status, voting   record, political philosophy, level of education, religious   preference, urban or rural residence, marital status, labor union   status, working status, ethnicity, age, sex, yearly income, and  willingness for call-back."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Dole, Bob"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign affairs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military intervention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public approval"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
