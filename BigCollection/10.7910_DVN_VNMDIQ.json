In addition, special attention was given to parental roles as well as to extended family networks. <br /> <br />  The sample consisted of 100 Mexican American and 150 African American (AA) parents; 22 African-American males and 129 females, 7 Mexican- American (MA) males and 94 Mexican-American females. The data were collected between 1975 and 1976. The age range of parents varied from 15 years to 75 years of age. A majority of parents obtained 10th-12th grade level educations. <br /> <br /> The data were collected utilizing standardized instruments and questionnaires which were administered twice, one year apart in the homes of participants or in the community centers by two researchers. Interviewers were strictly matched to the race and ethnicity of the family. Measures for the parents included perceived and objective social economic status, perception of children; needs/disabilities, coping strategies, religiosity, spirituality, self-esteem, locus of control, supportive networks, perceived stress and response to stress, depression, child behaviors, family environment, child rearing practices, and family empowerment.
