Causes, effects and context of political participation are difficult to quantitatively assess since direct participation is rare across the population. By using metadata from 234,000 events organised between 2005 and 2018, I measure the associations between a number of ecological variables at different level of geographic aggregation. I research the interaction between local electoral and participatory support for the M5S and among local support, political opinions and economic conditions. I find a clear correlation between participation and electoral support both in the 2013 and in the 2018 general elections and matching methods supports a causal inference. I also find that unemployment is associated with support for the M5S only in the Northern (and wealthier) regions, while in the South distrust towards political institutions is a much better predictor."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bailo, Francesco"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-01-14"}]}},"files":[]}}}
