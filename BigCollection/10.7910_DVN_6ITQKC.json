Users will need to recode missing responses (None, Don'\r\nt Know, Do Not Collect) that were allowed by the system in order to analyze numeric responses.   Due to the complexity of the survey, the files have been distributed in six separate data files A through F. Each file corresponds to a given section of the survey instrument.  Combined Section A corresponds to section A of the survey instrument – Voter Registration  Combined Section B corresponds to section B of the survey instrument – UOCAVA  Combined Section C corresponds to section C of the survey instrument – Domestic Absentee Ballots  Combined Section D corresponds to section D of the survey instrument – Election Administration  Combined Section E corresponds to section E of the survey instrument – Provisional Ballots  Combined Section F corresponds to section F of the survey instrument – Election Day Activities   The top row variable labels correspond to the question numbers in the survey instrument.
