This paper attempts to do both, using a general theoretical framework and detailed data at both the individual and national levels. In a first step, we focus on how risk exposure and income are related to preferences for redistribution. To test our hypotheses, we extract detailed risk-exposure measures from labour-force surveys and marry them to cross-national opinion survey data. Results from analysis of these data attest to the great importance of risks within the labour market in shaping popular preferences for redistributive efforts by governments. In a second step, we turn our attention to the supply side of government redistribution. Institutions, we argue, mediate governments' reactions to redistributional demands following economic shocks. Using time-series cross-country data, we demonstrate how national training systems, and electoral institutions, as well as partisanship, shape government responses.\n<br /><br />  <a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/SkillSpecificity.htm#Explanation\">Explanation of the skill specificity measure</a>   <br /> <a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/SkillSpecificity.htm#Note\">A note on the relationship between skills and class</a>"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/CusackIversenRehm2005.pdf\">Cusack, Thomas; Torben Iversen; and Rehm, Philipp. 2006. \"Risks at Work: The Demand and Supply Sides of Government Redistribution.\" Oxford Review of Economic Policy, vol. 22, no. 3</a>"}},{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/CusackIversenRehm2005.pdf\">Cusack, Thomas; Torben Iversen; and Rehm, Philipp. 2006. \"Risks at Work: The Demand and Supply Sides of Government Redistribution.\" Oxford Review of Economic Policy, vol. 22, no. 3</a>"}},{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/SocialPreferences.pdf\">An Asset Theory of Social Policy Preferences</a>"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IQSS Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/images/iqss-logo-background.png"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-08-10"}]}},"files":[{"description":"The following files contain the Stata commands for translating ISCO-68 into ISCO-88, several national codes into ISCO-88, and lower-level ISCO-88 codes into higher-level codes","label":"Conversion of French codes into isco88.doc","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42805,"categories":["3.
