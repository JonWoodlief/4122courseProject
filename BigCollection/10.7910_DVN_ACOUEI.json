The variables, where not self-explanatory, are described below:\r\nIdentification variables\r\nCase number: Sorting variable\r\nFarmer ID: coded identifier of owner of the land when the block was planted. ICRAF holds the name of each of these individuals.\r\nZone: locality where planted, as follows:\r\nNR: Nueva Requena\r\nCURI: Curiman√°\r\nSA: San Alejandro\r\nCFB: Carretera Federico Basadre\r\nTOUR: Tournavista\r\nPlot: Number of the plot, nested within each species (i.e. number are non-unique)\r\nBolaina: indicator variable for species. 1=Guazuma crinita, 0=not Guazuma crinita\r\nCapirona: indicator variable for species. 1=Calycophyllum spruceanum, 0=not Calycophyllum spruceanum\r\nPijuayo: indicator variable for species. 1= Bactris gasipaes, 0=not Bactris gasipaes\r\n\r\nGrowth variables\r\nAnnualized diameter increment: Basal diameter of all trees in each block were measured at ages between 12-14 months (Guazuma crinita), 15-17 months (Calycophyllum spruceanum), and 18 months (Bactris gasipaes). Mean monthly increments were calculated and then, for ease of presentation and comparison, converted these to annual increments (i.e., multiplying by 12); increments were used in order to minimize confounding of block (i.e. site) effects with measurement ages.\r\nAnnualized height increment: Height of all trees in each block were measured at ages between 12-14 months (Guazuma crinita), 15-17 months (Calycophyllum spruceanum), and 18 months (Bactris gasipaes). Mean monthly increments were calculated and then, for ease of presentation and comparison, converted these to annual increments (i.e., multiplying by 12); increments were used in order to minimize confounding of block (i.e. site) effects with measurement ages.\r\n\r\nSite variables\r\nSoil samples were collected at 0-15cm during the establishment of each plot.\r\npH: soil pH in 1:1 soil:water suspension\r\nP: available P (modified Olsen method)\r\nK: Available K\r\nCa: Exchangeable Ca2+\r\nMg2+: Exchangeable Mg2+ (ammonium acetate, quantification by atomic absorbtion); CEC: cation exchange capacity (ammonium acetate saturation method, pH7.0)\r\nAl Sat: Al3+ saturation (Yuan method, extraction with KCl, N)\r\nOrganic matter: % (oxidation with potassium dichromate)\r\nProportions of sand, silt, and clay: hydrometer method).\r\nFALLOW: indicator variable for previous land use (1=bush fallow, 0=not bush fallow)\r\nAGRICULTURE: indicator variable for previous land use (1= agriculture, i.e. cultivation of maize or rice, 0=not agriculture)\r\nPASTURE: indicator variable for previous land use (1= pastureland, 0=not pastureland)\r\nLand use was categorized based on direct observations and conversations with the landowners at time of establishment.
