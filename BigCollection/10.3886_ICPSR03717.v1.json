Workplace violence was  defined as any behavior by an individual that was intended to harm  workers of an organization, including all instances of physical and  verbal aggression and violence. The principal investigator coded all  cases of non-fatal workplace violence reported to the Lincoln Police  Department during the study period with regard to 17 factors,  including the type of workplace violence, the intimacy level of the  perpetrator (boyfriend/husband, ex-boyfriend/husband), whether a  weapon was mentioned, whether threats had been made, and the intensity  level of violence. The goals of this project were (1) to present  epidemiological information concerning non-fatal workplace violence,  (2) to address the different types of workplace violence and  differences across those types, and (3) to analyze risk factors associated with higher and lower intensity violence."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This project investigated non-fatal workplace  violence in a metropolitan Midwestern city with a population of  approximately 200,000. Workplace violence was defined as any behavior  by an individual that was intended to harm workers of an organization,  including all instances of physical and verbal aggression and  violence. The principal investigator studied one police department's  criminal records of workplace violence incidents over an 18-month  period to create a proactive and reactive cluster model for assessing  risk factors associated with varying levels of violence intensity. The  goals of this project were (1) to present epidemiological information  concerning non-fatal workplace violence, (2) to address the different  types of workplace violence and differences across those types, and  (3) to analyze risk factors associated with higher and lower intensity violence."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"With the cooperation of the chief of police, the  principal investigator identified workplace violence incidents in the  Lincoln Police Department computer database. All combinations of  police contacts (i.e., rape, physical assault) and location codes  (businesses) that satisfied workplace violence definition parameters  were targeted. An initial computer search tagged approximately 1,000  cases. Closer scrutiny of the criminal incident summaries on the  computer printout enabled researchers to rule out ineligible cases  that did not meet the parameters of the workplace violence  definition. This portion of the project produced approximately 400  eligible incident reports. The next step involved the manual retrieval  of actual criminal incident records. This final stage of  identification resulted in a net total of 254 incidents filed with the  Lincoln Police Department over the investigated 18-month period that  qualified as workplace violence incidents. Four researchers coded the  cases on 17 factors, including the type of workplace violence, the  intimacy level of the perpetrator (boyfriend/husband,  ex-boyfriend/husband), whether a weapon was mentioned, whether threats  had been made, and the intensity level of violence. Two teams randomly  coded 20 percent of the 254 non-fatal workplace violence  incidents. Teams A and B were sep\narated and instructed to individually  code their half of the 20 percent of randomly chosen cases, exchange  the cases once done, and discuss discrepancies that may have  occurred. Reliability for the initial step was held at a threshold of  .90 and no coding fell below .91 using a Kappa coefficient. Subsequent  to the first round of coding, cases were exchanged between Teams A and  B and the initial process was repeated. For the purpose of this  project, California's Occupational Safety and Health Association  (Cal/OSHA) categorization of workplace violence types was used. In the  first type of workplace violence (Type I) the perpetrator had no  legitimate relationship to the workplace and usually entered the  workplace to commit a robbery or other criminal act. In the second  category (Type II), the aggressor was either the recipient or the  object of a service provided by the affected workplace or the  victim. Finally, in the third category (Type III) the perpetrator had  an employment-related involvement with the workplace, such as an  assault by a current or former employee, supervisor or manager,  current/former spouse or lover, relative or friend, or some other person who had a dispute involving an employee of the workplace."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include location of the incident, type of  violence, level of injury, threats, motives, property damage, use of  weapon, time of year of incident, relationship between victim and  offender, presence of witnesses, whether the offender had a prior  criminal record, scale of violence intensity, and workplace violence  typology.
