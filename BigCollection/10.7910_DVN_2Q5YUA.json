Ramos (J . Plasma Phys. vol. 81, 2015 p. 905810325; vol. 82, 2016 p. 905820607). In this approach, the electric field is eliminated from a closed, hybrid fluid-kinetic system that ensures automatically the fulfillment of the charge neutrality condition. Considering the time dependence of a spatial-Fourier-mode linear perturbation with wavevector parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field, this can be cast as a second-order self-adjoint problem with a continuum spectrum of real and positive squared frequencies. Therefore, a conventional resolution of the identity with a continuum basis of singular normal modes is guaranteed, which simplifies significantly a Van Kampen-like treatment of the Landau damping. The explicit form of such singular normal modes is obtained, along with their orthogonality relations. These are used to derive the damped time evolution of the fluid moments of solutions of initial-value problems, for the most general kinds of initial conditions. The non-zero parallel electric field is not used explicitly in this analysis, but it is calculated from any given solution after the later has been obtained."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Landau damping"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"magneto hydrodynamics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MHD"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"plasmas"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quasineutral plasma"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/17ja/17ja035/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-17-35</a><br /><br />This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Grant No. DEFG02-91ER54109"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"17ja035_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":145735,"dataFile":{"id":3246800,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/2Q5YUA/VM0A4X","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/2Q5YUA/VM0A4X","filename":"17ja035_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":167578,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:166accf3a9c-7b4b8b89f082","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"dc3976ce64313577492a5143b14c0462","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"dc3976ce64313577492a5143b14c0462"}}}]}}}
