Ten couples were first-time parents and ten were having a second child. One-half of each group were local working-class couples and one-half were university-based middle class couples.\r\n <br /><br />\r\n   When available, the couple was interviewed jointly and then husband and wife were interviewed individually. Special emphasis was placed on those aspects of the transition to parenthood that the couple identified as contributing to learning about parenting or to their sense of growth in their roles as spouses. Topics covered in the semistructured open-ended interviews in late pregnancy included history of the marital relationship, allocation of household work, social networks, pregnancy experience, expectations for parenthood, and future plans. The postpartum couple interviews covered labor and delivery, reactions to the baby, arrangements for household\r\nmanagement and infant care, feelings about being a parent, and future plans. The individual interviews explored some of these same issues in more detail.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n   The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (typed transcripts of all interviews).
