Two cities, New York City and  Philadelphia, were selected for intensive investigation of  victimization of immigrants. In each of these cities, three immigrant  communities in a neighborhood were chosen for participation. In New  York's Jackson Heights area, Colombians, Dominicans, and Indians were  the ethnic groups studied. In Philadelphia's Logan section,  Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Koreans were surveyed. In all, 87 Jackson  Heights victims were interviewed and 26 Philadelphia victims were  interviewed. The victim survey questions addressed can be broadly  divided into two categories: issues pertaining to crime reporting and  involvement with the court system by immigrant victims.   Variables include type of crime, respondent's role in the  incident, relationship to the perpetrator, whether the incident was  reported to police, and who reported the incident. Respondents were  also asked whether they were asked to go to court, whether they  understood what the people in court said to them, whether they  understood what was happening in their case, and, if victimized again, whether they would report the incident to the police."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this study was to examine  interrelated issues surrounding the use of the criminal justice system  by immigrant victims and to identify ways to improve the criminal  justice response to immigrants' needs and problems. Questions  addressed by this study can be broadly divided into two categories:  issues pertaining to reporting crimes and involvement with the court  system by immigrant victims. Some crime reporting questions are: To  what extent do immigrant populations underreport crimes to the police?  Is underreporting more characteristic of some immigrant groups than  others? What are the principal reasons for underreporting? Which types  of crimes are most and least likely to be reported to authorities?  What is the experience with the police of immigrants who do report  crimes? What kinds of institutional barriers exist to reporting crimes  to the police, and what could be done to remove the barriers?  Questions concerning court system involvement include: Are immigrant  victims who do report crimes willing to cooperate with court officials  in prosecuting? If they are reluctant, what are their reservations?  What institutional barriers exist to cooperating with court officials in prosecuting and adjudicating cases?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study takes an exploratory look at a set of  interrelated issues surrounding use of the criminal justice system by  immigrant victims. A variety of convergent methods were used to  address the issues examined. Respondents to a national survey of  police chiefs, prosecutor agencies, and court administrators from the  50 largest United States cities were asked their opinions about the  extent to which victims who were recent immigrants have equal access  to the criminal justice system and about impediments to fuller  participation. Upon c\nompletion of the national survey, New York City  and Philadelphia were selected for intensive investigation.  Neighborhoods with a strong multi-ethnic character were examined. In  New York's Jackson Heights area, Colombians, Dominicans, and Indians  were studied. In Philadelphia's Logan section, Vietnamese, Cambodians,  and Koreans were surveyed. Interviews in Jackson Heights were  conducted over the telephone by multilingual Victim Services staff. In  all, 87 Jackson Heights victims were interviewed. Of the 26  Philadelphia victims interviewed, 12 were interviewed in person in  their homes, and 14 were interviewed by telephone. The interviews in  Philadelphia were conducted by local Asian ethnic contractors. Those  individuals who reported crimes to the police were asked about their  experiences with the police and/or the court. For persons who failed  to report a crime, reasons for their reluctance in reporting were elicited."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include type of crime,  respondent's role in the incident, relationship to the perpetrator,  whether the incident was reported to police, and who reported the  incident.
