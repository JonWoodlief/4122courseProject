Using epigenomic methods, we characterized enhancer elements specifically modified in differentiating intestinal epithelial cells and found enrichment of transcription factor-binding motifs corresponding to CDX2, a critical regulator of the intestine. Directed investigation revealed surprising lability in CDX2 occupancy of the genome, with redistribution from hundreds of sites occupied only in proliferating cells to thousands of new sites in differentiated cells. Knockout mice confirmed distinct Cdx2 requirements in dividing and mature adult intestinal cells, including responsibility for the active enhancer configuration associated with maturity. Dynamic CDX2 occupancy corresponds with condition-specific gene expression and, importantly, to differential co-occupancy with other tissue-restricted transcription factors: HNF4A in mature cells and GATA6 in progenitors. These results reveal dynamic, contextspecific functions and mechanisms of a prominent transcriptional regulator within a cell lineage."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-10-18"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Dev Cell_Verzi.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54343,"dataFile":{"id":1581691,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Dev Cell_Verzi.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":8981259,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:61865","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"04aaf9dc48738d77a007efd082cbc255","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"04aaf9dc48738d77a007efd082cbc255"}}}]}}}
