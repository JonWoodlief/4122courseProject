It  queried a subsample of teachers who were in the profession during the  school year 1993-1994 and has two components: teachers who left the  teaching profession between the school years 1993-1994 and 1994-1995  (leavers) and teachers who remained in the profession  (stayers). Information in this collection is given separately for  public school teachers (Part 1) and private school teachers (Part  2).
