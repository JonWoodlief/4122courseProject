Surveys of Consumer Finances were   conducted annually from 1946 through 1971 and again in 1977. The 1986   survey was designed primarily to update essential information such as   household balance sheet and employment data for family units in the   sample. Limited information was solicited on the disposition of assets,   purchase and sale of homes, and major expenditures for health,   durables, charity, and education. Data were also collected to compute   savings for the sample households over the period 1983-1986. In   addition, the 1986 survey added new lines of inquiry to explore the   broad role of the family in economic behavior. Substantial new   information was collected on gifts made or received by the household.   Data were also gathered on the sharing of living quarters over the   previous three years. Information on income and on marital and  employment history for those three years was recorded as well."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial assets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial balances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"savings"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.A.

Additional weights were constructed and   included in the recoded data file. New variables were also constructed   directly from original variables and, in addition, were created by   matching information from other sources such as the United States   Census.

Those   known to ICPSR are contained in the Federal Reserve Board recoded data   section entitled \"Calculated Relative Real Wage Growth Variables\"   (C1822 to C1830 and C1922 to C1930). The Federal Reserve Board affirms   that the data values are correct but that no additional documentation   is available. The first four variables in the recoded data are   undocumented ID variables.
