Due to the usual bias toward residence-based taxation in DTTs, net capital importers can\r\nface a considerable loss of tax revenues when entering these treaties. Nevertheless, there is an ever denser and\r\ngrowing global network of such treaties. This article argues that net capital–importing countries are caught in a\r\nprisoners’ dilemma: Collectively, they would be better off refusing to sign DTTs, but each one has an incentive to\r\nsign DTTs to gain a competitive advantage. Countries will look toward and be influenced by the policy choices of\r\nother focal countries and will follow their DTT activity. We find evidence for such spatial dependence in our analysis\r\nof DTT diffusion in a global sample over the period 1969–2005. Dyads are more likely to sign a DTT the more\r\nDTTs have previously been concluded by the regional peers of the dyad members as well as by other countries\r\nwho compete with at least one of the dyad members in terms of export product structure."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-02-19"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for ISQ directed (DTT).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":124233,"dataFile":{"id":3001744,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/FUGTDT/H0IOYZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FUGTDT/H0IOYZ","filename":"Article for ISQ directed (DTT).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":210153735,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a56087230-c54d9797c6fb","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:tO31PXmzBzkviz+Bh5ulAw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fcee65ff01084d241f9ad55b11768ef4","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fcee65ff01084d241f9ad55b11768ef4"}}},{"label":"Article for ISQ (DTT).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124233,"dataFile":{"id":3001745,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/FUGTDT/0RWIHC","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FUGTDT/0RWIHC","filename":"Article for ISQ (DTT).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":17438,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a56073e6f-899623468512","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"58bab0c4c3d4151a1b686ef7560b9caf","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"58bab0c4c3d4151a1b686ef7560b9caf"}}},{"label":"Article for ISQ undirected (DTT).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":124233,"dataFile":{"id":3001743,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/FUGTDT/HVRW1R","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FUGTDT/HVRW1R","filename":"Article for ISQ undirected (DTT).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":113948558,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a560930cd-b86aea4263ac","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:Drs2tHQu9tYB79XMVpyK8Q==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e5610b607579a246d4b03c278a8e016e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e5610b607579a246d4b03c278a8e016e"}}}]}}}
