This system is called the  NEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to  provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes  of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital  EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national  sample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a  stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and  its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The  sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and  small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per  hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond  routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related  products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and  poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and  distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor  unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)  identify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for  follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and  (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion  effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in  a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique  and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,  annually, the final edited data are released as public use data files  for use by other public health professionals and researchers. These  public use data files provide NEISS AIP data on nonfatal injuries  collected from July through December 2000 (ICPSR 3582), from January  through December 2001 (ICPSR 3817), from January through December 2002  (ICPSR 4085), and from January through December 2003 (ICPSR  4352). Variables in the datasets include body part affected by injury,  diagnosis, case disposition, fire involvement, immediate cause of  injury, injury as determined by the CDC, intent of injury, intent with  sexual/other assault, locales where injured, precipitating cause of  injury, perpetrator to victim relationship in assault, reason for  assault, whether injury was sports-related or traffic-related, whether  it was a violent injury, and date of injury. Demographic information specifies race, sex, and age of patient."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"accidents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nonfatal injuries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"poisoning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"product safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
