The principal objectives of the survey were to  collect current consumer expenditure data to provide a continuous flow  of data on the buying habits of American consumers for use in a wide  variety of social and economic research and analysis, and to provide  data for future revisions to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The 1980  diary survey data were derived from the reports of over 5,500 sample  consumer units. Consumer units were asked to list all of their  expenses during the period they were in the survey. The diary data  were collected with a household characteristics questionnaire and a  separate questionnaire to record daily expenses. The diary survey was  intended to obtain reliable expenditure data on small, frequently-  purchased items that are normally difficult to recall. These items  include expenditures for food and beverages, gas and electricity,  gasoline, housekeeping supplies, nonprescription drugs and medical supplies, and personal care products and services."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumption"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"debt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household budgets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"purchasing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR XII.

Geographic classification was by Standard  Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) status and Census region.  However, the 1981 sample did not include rural areas outside the SMSA  samples. Since the rural sample was not collected in 1981, the Bureau  of Labor Statistics was able to provide region data for consumer units  living outside SMSAs in 1981. In 1980, the region was collapsed  because the outside rural west sample was too small to meet  confidentiality requirements. (2) Unlike previous surveys, which were  conducted every 10 to 12 years, the 1980-1981 surveys were the  beginning of an ongoing survey that provided data on a continual  basis. (3) Two sets of population weights are provided. (4) The  codebooks are provided by the principal investigator as Portable  Document\nFormat (PDF) files.
