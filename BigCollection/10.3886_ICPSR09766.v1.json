Demographic information on   respondents includes sex, race, age, state of residence, and   political party alignment. Parts 1 and 2 (October 8 and 9 Polls),   conducted the day the vote was delayed and the day after, examined   whether respondents had heard or read about the charge of sexual   harassment brought against Clarence Thomas, whether they approved of   the Senate's delaying the confirmation vote in order to look into the   charge, and whether the Senate should confirm Thomas's nomination to   the Supreme Court. Respondents were also asked whether the charge of   sexual harassment had changed their opinion on whether to support   Thomas, whether the charge, if true, would be reason enough for the   Senate to reject his nomination, and whether the charge against   Thomas was true according to their best guess. Additional questions   probed respondents' opinions on the way the Senate had handled the   Thomas nomination, whether the respondent was more likely to believe   the man or the woman if a woman said she was sexually harassed on the   job by a man, and if the respondent had ever been sexually harassed   at work. Part 3 (October 12 Poll), in addition to repeating questions   from Parts 1 and 2, examined how closely the respondent had been   following the news about charges of sexual harassment brought against   Clarence Thomas, whether Hill or Thomas was the more believable   witness, whether Thomas was qualified to be a Supreme Court justice,   whether Bush could have selected a more qualified candidate, and if   the respondent had ever been sexually harassed outside the job. Part   4 (October 13 Poll) replicated previous questions and probed new   areas, such as whether Clarence Thomas had been treated fairly or   unfairly as a Supreme Court nominee, whether Anita Hill had been   treated fairly or unfairly, and whether the person who leaked Anita   Hill's Senate Judiciary Committee statement to the news media should   face criminal charges. Additional questions included whether   respondents approved/disapproved of various people and groups who had   been involved in the Senate hearings on Thomas, whether respondents   had discussed the issue of sexual harassment with other people as a   result of the charge against Thomas, whether the attention given to   the issue of sexual harassment would make men be more careful in the   way they relate to women in the workplace, whether sexual harassment   of women in the workplace is a problem in this country, and whether   the Senate investigation of the sexual harassment accusation would   end up being a good or a bad thing for the country. Part 5 (October   14 Poll) repeated previous questions and added a new query addressing   the issue of whether the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the   sexual harassment charge against Clarence Thomas should have been  held in private, in public, or not at all."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"confirmation hearings"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hill, Anita"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sexual harassment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court justices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court nominations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Thomas, Clarence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Supreme Court"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
