Questions related to the women's movement queried respondents on whether they would vote for a woman presidential candidate and if the country was ready to elect a woman, how they felt about the Equal Rights A\nmendment, differences in employment opportunities, salaries and home responsibilities between the genders, and general attitudes regarding feminism and the women's rights movement. Views were also sought on the upcoming federal elections, including the Democratic and Republican primaries/caucuses. Respondents were asked for their opinions of Texas governor George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, developer Donald Trump, and Reform Party founder Ross Perot. They were also asked about the importance of a candidate's prior military service, the amount of attention they paid to the campaign, and the likelihood that they would vote in the primary and general elections. Questions also addressed which candidates respondents would like to see as the party nominees, which nominees they would most likely vote for in head-to-head matchups among Gore, Bradley, McCain, and Bush, which party they would vote for in the presidential and congressional elections, and which party they voted for in the 1996 presidential and U.S. House elections. Respondents were also asked to provide their opinions of President Clinton's job performance and the most important problem for the government to address. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, ethnicity, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, marital status, employment status, family income, and age of children in the household."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
