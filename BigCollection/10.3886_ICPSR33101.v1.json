The program has the goal of building protection and impeding risk trajectories for aggression, violence, and school failure. The program utilizes multiple family groups (four to six families) combined with reading tutoring for the child. The SAFE Effectiveness Trial (SAFE-E) involved community providers delivering the family group intervention and upper grade students delivering the tutoring program. The trial took place between 2006 and 2010, and involved two age cohorts of children. Collaborating with two community mental health agencies and six elementary schools serving high-poverty, high-crime neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois, families were randomly assigned to intervention groups of four to six families during their child's first grade year. Children also received tutoring from tutors selected from the upper grades of the child's school. Assessments were collected prior to, during and after the intervention to assess developmental influences, fidelity, process, and implementation characteristics that might affect impact. The purpose of these assessments was to examine the relation of implementation qualities to variation in intervention effects. Quality of implementation was expected to affect short and long-term impact of the intervention, focusing on three primary areas: (1) fidelity of implementation of the program, (2) provider characteristics, such as tutors' reading levels, and attitudes and orientation of the family intervention providers, and (3) quality of support for implementation. The data are from fidelity and process measures developed for this study and measures completed by parents, teachers, and children over four waves of measurement spanning two years, beginning in the fall of each child's first grade year."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of SAFEChildren when implemented with community providers of the family intervention and tutors recruited from the student bodies of the participating schools (the SAFE Effectiveness Trial).

The primary target sample for this study was the children (and their parents/caregivers) enrolled in first grade at six elementary schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. In addition, teachers were enrolled to provide sources of data about the children; tutors and mental health service providers were also included as participants in the study. Individual children and their families were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. In addition to the 1st grade participants, 278 7th and 8th graders who had been nominated by teachers were recruited to be trained and to participate as tutors for the 1st grade children in the treatment condition. Because of the principal investigators' prior involvement with Chicago area inner-city, several schools were interested in participating prior to the beginning of the project. The two community mental health agencies that were recruited were agencies that served the communities in which the schools were located.</p>\n\n<p>A two-stage procedure was used for recruitment and consent of families. The participating schools provided the researchers with the names, addresses, and phone numbers of all children attending kindergarten. Initial information was sent to all families. Following these letters, program staff contacted each family by phone or home visit. The research program was explained to families and informed consent was obtained. Eighth-grade tutors were nominated by their teachers. A consent procedure similar to that of the first-grade participants was followed to secure parent consent and child assent for participation. The tutors received 40 hours of training prior to beginning the intervention and received 30 minutes of supervision each week during the course of the intervention. Providers were recruited and hired by their respective agencies, and trained by university personnel.</p>\n\n<p>The study consisted of two components, a process and fidelity measurement looking at the parents, therapists and tutors who participated in the SAFEChildren program (Datasets 4-14), and an effectiveness evaluation that compared a control group of children and parents to a treatment group participating in the SAFEChildren program. Demographic and administrative data were collected for both the control and treatment groups (Dataset 1) as well as data about any twins participating in the study (Dataset 3). Each child was assigned a unique identifier for the Effectiveness Evaluation and a different identifier for the Process and Fidelity Characteristics (Dataset 2). All interviews were conducted using laptop computers and were checked for accuracy and completeness.</p>\n\n<p>The Process and Fidelity Characteristics portion of the study (Datasets 4-13) used a sample which consisted of the participants who were (1) randomly assigned to receive intervention, and (2) in attendance at the specific sessions wherein the measures were administered. Dataset 4 provides data on attendance at each session. This included the parents or caregivers of children in the treatment group (Datasets 5, 7, 9, and 12), the therapists (Datasets 6, 8, 10, and 13), and youth tutors (Datasets 11 and 14) participating in the study. Process assessments were completed at four week intervals during the interventions. Data were collected from families and group leaders for three constructs: Fidelity of Provision of Services (e.g., group activities); Group Intervention Processes (e.g., attitudes about the group leader, family involvement); and Provider Characteristics, (e.g., education, attitudes about prevention). At four sessions, tutoring supervisors completed ratings of the tutors and process measures were administered to the tutors. Tutoring supervisors rated tutors on \"Quality of Relationship and Quality of Tutoring\". The process measures completed by tutors comprised scales for \"Tutees Relationship with the Tutor\" and \"About the Program\".</p>\n\n<p>For the effectiveness evaluation, family interviews were scheduled around convenient times for the family. The interviewer completed the child interview (Datasets 15, 18, 21, and 24) prior to interviewing the caregiver(s) or parent(s) (Datasets 16, 19, 22, and 25). If two caregivers were present and agreeable, both were interviewed. At random, 5 percent of families were contacted and re-interviewed (briefly) to assure reliability and validity. Each child's teacher was asked to fill out question\nnaires on the child's behavior, social competence, and self-regulation at each wave (Datasets 17, 20, 23, and 26).

The first was an effectiveness evaluation comparing a control group of children and parents to a treatment group that participated in the SAFEChildren program. The second was a process and fidelity measurement which looked only at the experiences of the treatment group. The Sample Data, ID Link Data, and Twin ID Data (Datasets 1-3) provide data on participants, and link the two components of the study. Although the sample in the process and fidelity measurement was the same as the treatment group in the effectiveness evaluation, the IDs assigned to the children were different in the two study components. The ID Link Data (Dataset 2) provides a key to link the identification variable from the effectiveness evaluation (AID) with the identification variable from the process and fideli\nty measurement (CHILDID).

The final report references 384 children participating, including 191 students/families randomized to the treatment condition. However, one family withdrew consent after the intervention (consistent with the procedure detailed in the consent form), and their data were removed from the database, leaving data on a total of 383 children, including 190 in the treatment condition. Additionally, the report indicates that there were five participating schools.
