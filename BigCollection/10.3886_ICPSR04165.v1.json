HCC2 reinterviewed respondents to the first National  Survey of Alcohol, Drug, and Mental Health Problems (HCC1) and a  cross-section of adult respondents from the second Community Tracking  Study (CTS) Household Survey (CTS2). Previously, HCC1 reinterviewed a  cross-section of adult respondents from the first CTS Household Survey  (CTS1). HCC1 is available as the NATIONAL SURVEY OF ALCOHOL, DRUG, AND  MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS [HEALTHCARE FOR COMMUNITIES], 1997-1998 (ICPSR  3025), CTS1 as the COMMUNITY TRACKING STUDY HOUSEHOLD SURVEY,  1996-1997, AND FOLLOWBACK SURVEY, 1997-1998 (ICPSR 2524), and CTS2 as  the COMMUNITY TRACKING STUDY HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, 1998-1999, AND  FOLLOWBACK SURVEY, 1998-2000 (ICPSR 3199). Central to the design of  the CTS Household Surveys, from which all HCC1 and HCC2 respondents  originated, is its community focus. Sixty sites (51 metropolitan and 9  nonmetropolitan areas) were randomly selected to form the core of the  CTS surveys and to be representative of the nation as a whole. The CTS  Household Surveys were administered to households in the 60 CTS sites  (known as the site sample) and to a supplemental national sample of  households. Both HCC1 and HCC2 focused on the care and treatment for  alcohol, drug, and mental health conditions. Like HCC1, the HCC2  questionnaire collected information on (1) demographics, (2) health  and daily activities, (3) mental health, (4) alcohol and illicit drug  use, (5) use of medications, (6) general health insurance and  insurance coverage for mental health, substance abuse, and  prescription medications, (7) access, utilization, and quality of  behavioral health care, (8) labor market status, income, and wealth,  and (9) life difficulties. Three sets of a data files are supplied  with this collection: a set containing the interviews completed with  the follow-up sample of persons who responded to HCC1, a set  containing the interviews completed with the cross-sectional sample of  subjects who responded to CTS2, and a set named the \"complete sample\"  which contains all of the completed interviews. Five imputed versions  of the data are included with each set for analysis with multiple imputation techniques."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug treatment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental disorders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self medication"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"treatment programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.

Among the  follow-up respondents, 2,410 were also interviewed in the 60 CTS sites  by CTS2. The cross-sectional respondents comprised these 2,410  individuals plus another 5,499 adult respondents who were randomly  selected from among the CTS2 site sample respondents. In HCC1,  information reported by CTS1 respondents was used to oversample among  low-income respondents, individuals who had used specialty mental  health services in the preceding year, and individuals who had  reported high psychological distress. The selection of the latter  5,499 cross-sectional respondents oversampled the same groups as well  as individuals who reported that they had seen a doctor or other  healthcare professional for alcohol-related problems in the past two  years. As in HCC1, individuals from low intensity sites were oversampled relative to high intensity sites."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Complete Sample, Fifth Imputed Data
