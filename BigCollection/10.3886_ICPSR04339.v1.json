The study was  conducted using three waves of interviews as well as administrative  data. The baseline interview was given to and administrative data were  collected on 306 juveniles.

The JBTC model was expected to be an improvement upon  existing treatment and rehabilitation interventions for drug-involved  juvenile offenders because juvenile offenders tend to have co-occurring  psychological and behavioral problems that require multi-faceted  approaches. In particular, JBTC built upon what had been learned about  the implementation and effects of programs that attempted to integrate  substance abuse treatment with other programmatic interventions  (mental health, family, etc.) and monitoring activities (urine  analysis, court monitoring, etc.). The purpose of this study was to  evaluate the effects of the JBTC program on interim and longer-term  outcomes such as adherence to program requirements, results of urine testing, school performance, and rearrest for new offenses."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The impact of the Juvenile Breaking the Cycle  program (JBTC) was assessed by evaluating the outcomes of a sample of  306 juveniles who were risk assessed by the Lane County, Oregon  Department of Youth Services (DYS) between April 15, 2000, and November  15, 2001. Of the 306 juveniles recruited into the study, 149, or 49  percent, were enrolled in JBTC, and 157, or 51 percent, were not  enrolled in the JBTC program. Juveniles were identified as substance  involved (alcohol and/or other drug, or AOD) following an encounter  with police that led to either an arrest or a citation. Following the  police encounter, a juvenile was either turned over to DYS or cited  and released. Those sent to DYS were processed by intake personnel,  who administered a risk assessment. If the assessment identified the  juvenile as having AOD problems and as high risk, the juvenile was  assigned to JBTC. Juveniles were considered to be high risk if their  total\nrisk scores were above ten. However, in some cases intake staff  would override a risk score below ten and classify a juvenile as high  risk. Typically, this occurred to ensure a juvenile would receive  treatment when the juvenile had a high score on the drug component but  scored relatively low on the other components. Three waves of  interviews were conducted, and administrative data were collected on a  baseline sample of 306 juveniles. Parental consent was obtained prior  to interviews, and the juveniles were also asked to consent to the  interview. The baseline interview, with 306 respondents, occurred  within about 1 month of the juvenile receiving risk assessment at  DYS. The second interview, with 208 respondents, was conducted  approximately 6 months after the baseline interview. The third  interview, with 183 respondents, was conducted approximately 6 months  after the second interview, or 12 months after the baseline  interview. The baseline interview took about 30 minutes, and the  follow-up interviews took between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete.  Respondents were given gift certificates for local shopping malls as  compensation for their participation. Administrative data, including  demographic characteristics, risk assessment scores, and additional  data on criminal history were obtained from DYS. Data describing  substance abuse treatment and mental health counseling episodes were  collected from the Oregon Client Process Monitoring System (CPMS).  These data were used to verify the respondents' history of substance  abuse treatment and mental health counseling. Data from the Oregon  Youth Authority's Juvenile Justice Information System (JJIS) were used  to determine the extent to which those participating in the study were  involved in the juvenile justice system and to verify the respondents'  history of contact with the juvenile justice system. All measures of  delinquency reported in this study exclude the instant offense, which  is the arrest that led to the juvenile being eligible to participate in the study."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"These data contain demographic variables on the  respondent including age, gender, race, where they live (in a house,  apartment, shelter, etc.), with whom they live, and the primary source  of their caregiver's income. Further information on the respondent  includes JBTC program assignment, substance abuse risk score, total  risk score, and DYS risk assessment status. Respondents were asked  about their history of alcohol and/or other drug use including  lifetime use, age at first use, frequency of use in the past 6  months, and frequency of use in the past 30 days of the following:  tobacco products, alcohol, marijuana, crack cocaine, powder cocaine,  amphetamines, inhalants, hallucinogens, heroin,  barbiturates/tranquilizers, and designer drugs (ecstasy, etc.), and if  they had ever received any alcohol and/or drug treatment or education.  Respondents were also asked if they had ever been diagnosed with  attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADD/ADHD), bi-polar disorder, anger management issues, post traumatic  stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, and if they had ever  received any in-patient or out-patient mental health treatment. To  assess their prior contact with the juvenile justice system,  respondents were asked about their prior arrests, age at first arrest,  and prior time on probation, in detention, on parole, or in a  diversion program. Respondents were asked about family history of  severe drug or alcohol problems, criminal background, contact with  family members, and relationship with family members. Respondents were  also asked about their school status (enrollment, grades, days missed,  etc.), involvement in gang activity, involvement in sexual activity,  whether they carried a weapon (gun, knife, stick, etc.), and whether  they had ever been threatened with or threatened someone with a  weapon.
