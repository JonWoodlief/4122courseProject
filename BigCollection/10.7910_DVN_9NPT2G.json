Within the\r\ncontext of ongoing debates about the motives for overseas study, the reproduction of class advantage,\r\nand countries’ competitive advantage for internationally mobile students, this paper seeks to\r\nimprove understanding of these variations. We situate international student mobilities within a\r\ntheoretical framework which connects recent work in geography, emphasising the differentiation\r\nadvantage derived from foreign study, with insights more commonly applied to labour migration\r\nwhich emphasise costs and benefits. Our findings, based on a statistical analysis of a large sample\r\nof country pairs, call into question the central importance commonly ascribed to countries’\r\nuniversity quality in shaping the mobilities of international students. Far more influential is income\r\nin destination countries, together with relational ties created by colonial linkages, common language\r\nand pre-existing migrant stocks. Unique to the literature, we not only demonstrate important\r\ndifferences in the determinants of international student mobilities between developed and developing\r\ncountries, but also between different sub-groupings of developing countries. Indeed, an\r\nimportant insight from our study is that it may be useful to move beyond binary classifications, and\r\nto deploy more refined country categorisations in seeking to understand contemporary corporeal\r\nmobilities."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-29"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for Geographical Journal (student migration).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":80629,"dataFile":{"id":2798991,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/9NPT2G/BU8Y4S","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9NPT2G/BU8Y4S","filename":"Article for Geographical Journal (student migration).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":20635,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153c39fd4d9-052770a86607","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ad4aec2d529abf057d8b12103f2eaafb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ad4aec2d529abf057d8b12103f2eaafb"}}},{"label":"Article for Geographical Journal (student migration).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":80629,"dataFile":{"id":2798990,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/9NPT2G/XXLNNB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9NPT2G/XXLNNB","filename":"Article for Geographical Journal (student migration).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":67697320,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153c3a62e27-bb617150c090","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:BJLnZoPvSf9UTchAQAt5kQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e1e45c608c66d620e9d0dcb2f2c1a413","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e1e45c608c66d620e9d0dcb2f2c1a413"}}}]}}}
