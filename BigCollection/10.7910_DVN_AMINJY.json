Such challenges have opened up a period of radical change for the EU, among them, the Brexit referendum that will radically change EU’s geography. \r\n\tThis turmoil is mirrored by the last European Parliament (EP) election results; extreme right and left wing parties succeeded in the electoral competition at the expense of their mainstream counterpart. These forces are generally labelled as ‘Eurosceptic’, even though the literature still lacks a clear-cut definition of Euroscepticism.  \r\n\tStarting from this observation, this paper reviews the conceptual evolution of Euroscepticism, stressing its pros and cons and proposes a reconceptualisation of it in terms of EU-opposition such that the objects of criticism are clearly identified as the EU-policies, the EU-elite, the EU-regime and the EU-community. \r\n\tThe paper applies ‘EU-opposition’ to examine empirically the activity of two ‘Eurosceptic’ parties in the EP: the Italian Five Stars Movement (FSM) and the British United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), using the speeches they deliver in the arena of the EP as the main source of data. \r\n\tFrom the analysis, it can be seen that UKIP and FSM are an odd couple working in the same party-group in the EP, and the concept of EU-opposition is able to better disentangle UKIP and FSM’s criticism of the EU."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-09-26"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Datasets for the replication of the figures included in the above-mentioned paper are submitted.
