The survey first  asked the respondents to name their place of residence (in terms of  state, county, and town), how long they had lived at their residence,  and how much longer they planned to reside there. Then a sequence of  questions asked respondents for their thoughts about the community,  such as how they felt about it, whether they felt they belonged,  whether they were fairly treated or excluded from the community, and  how safe they felt walking around their community at night. They were  also asked about the attitudes of individuals and the relationships  between community members. The survey further asked about community  involvement, group membership, and social participation, access to  outside sources for problem-solving, and how well the members  cooperated with one another (in groups and in neighborhoods) when they  disagreed. The questionnaire also asked respondents to assess how well  people of different ethnic groups interacted with the community as a  whole and within groups, organizations, and activities. It asked for  respondents' assessment of government services for the community,  their trust in government as well as members and leaders of local  groups (business, ethnic, and religious), and the coo\nperation of the  community in emergencies. Respondents were asked to evaluate their  ability to make a positive impact in their community and the ability  of people and groups to provide assistance to the poverty-stricken and  to reduce the number of those in poverty. Moreover, the survey asked  respondents about the presence of leadership programs in their  community and the effects, if any, they had on its members. Switching  the focus, respondents were asked to evaluate their personal or  financial status, their ability to acquire a loan, credit, or other  financial services, and if they ever had difficulty paying for living  costs (food, housing, electricity, heating, telephone, or health  care). They were also asked to estimate how many people in the  community could not afford the basic living costs. Questions were  asked of respondents about their interest in staying informed about  public affairs, how often they accessed information in newspapers, how  often they voted in elections, the frequency in which young people  left town in search of better opportunities, and about the possibility  of implementing and developing small/local businesses within the  community. Finally, the survey collected general demographic  information including marital status, age, gender, race, education,  religion and religious affiliation, employment status, location of  residence (state, county, and town), whether they own or rent their  home, household composition, current assets and income, and their access to telephones and the Internet."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"access to
