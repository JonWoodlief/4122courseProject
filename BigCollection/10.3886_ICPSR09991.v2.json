The study used secondary data derived from the Treatment Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS). TOPS is a longitudinal survey with data on over 11,000 drug users admitted to 41 different treatment programs in 10 different cities across the United States for the years 1979-1981. For each wave of data collection, all clients who made contact with selected TOPS treatment programs completed intake interviews. A subsample of these clients were then interviewed during treatment at one- and three-month intervals after admission to treatment. Finally, follow-up interviews were conducted with these clients one and two years following treatment or three to five years following treatment. Complete data from two waves, 1979 and 1980, and partial data from the third wave, 1981, are available in this collection. Part 1, Analysis Data, contains selected intake, in-treatment, and follow-up data available for all respondents in the 1979 and 1980 TOPS cohorts who completed one-year follow-up interviews. Variables pertain to demographic characteristics of clients, drug treatment programs in which they were enrolled, activities and behaviors of clients during in-treatments, particularly those related to drug involvement, criminal involvement, employment, and income, and activities and behaviors during the 3- and 12-month follow-ups. Part 2, Cost Analysis Data, contains cost analysis data on all respondents in the 1979 and 1980 cohorts. Variables describe the criminal activities of drug treatment clients up to one year before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment and also estimate the cost of crime as a result of the respondent's activities (victim cost, criminal justice system cost, and crime career/productivity cost). Part 3, Supplementary Cost Analysis Data, 1981, contains supplementary follow-up data for all respondents in the 1981 cohort. Information is included on the criminal activities of drug treatment clients three to five years after treatment and the estimated resulting cost of these activities. Part 4, Full Sample of Initial Intake Interview Data, consists of intake interview data for all the samples in the TOPS study. The file contains interview reference variables, demographic and background characteristics of clients, and drug treatment center admission variables, as well as items on clients' living arrangements, alcohol and drug use, drug treatment history, illegal activities, employment, and income and expenditures."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime reduction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug related crimes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug treatment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"treatment outcomes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"treatment programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

Intake  interviews for Treatment Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS) clients  employed a census rather than a sample, except for one detoxification  program. Some Treatment Alternatives to Street Crimes Programs (TASC)  clients not referred to TOPS also completed intake interviews. Of  those who completed the intake interview, subsequent in-treatment  interviews were scheduled and conducted until a client refused, missed  two consecutive appointments, died or was rendered incapable of  participation, or left the program. Stratified sampling was used to  select sample cohorts for the follow-up interviews among TOPS  clients. All TASC clients who were assigned to one of the outpatient  drug-free and residential modalities and who completed an intake  interview were selected to be interviewed for the follow-up study. The  primary sample selection strata were treatment modalities for all  three cohorts. Secondary strata for the 1979 cohort were treatment  programs by time-in-program categories, while for the 1980 and 1981 cohort samples the secondary strata were the treatment programs."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Analysis Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41821,"dataFile":{"id":2662671,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Analysis Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Cost Analysis Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41821,"dataFile":{"id":2662672,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Cost Analysis Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Full Sample of Initial Intake Interview Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41821,"dataFile":{"id":2662674,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Full Sample of Initial Intake Interview Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Supplementary Cost Analysis Data, 1981","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41821,"dataFile":{"id":2662673,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Supplementary Cost Analysis Data, 1981","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
