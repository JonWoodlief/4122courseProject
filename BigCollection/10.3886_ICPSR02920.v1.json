The focus of this data collection was on the political  atmosphere in the United States prior to President Bill Clinton's  January 27, 2001, State of the Union address. Respondents were asked  to give their opinions of President Clinton and his handling of the  presidency, as well as their views of Vice President Al Gore and the  United States Congress. Respondents were also asked to specify which  of the following issues was most important for the government to  address: the budget deficit, education, health care, Medicare, Social  Security, or taxes. A series of questions addressed the upcoming  November 7, 2000, presidential election, including whether the  respondent's vote should be considered a vote in support of or against  Clinton's policies, what leadership style the next president should  employ, and whether the respondent would vote for the Democratic or  Republican candidate, if the election were held that day. An  additional question sought res\npondents' views on whether Elian  Gonzalez, the Cuban boy who was found off the Florida coast after  escaping Cuba, should remain in the United States with relatives or  return to live with his father in Cuba. Background information on  respondents includes age, gender, political party, political  orientation, voter registration and participation history, race, Hispanic origin, and marital status."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
