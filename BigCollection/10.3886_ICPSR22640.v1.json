Data were collected between August 2006 and April 2007 using a convenience sample (n=100). Three individuals from the SWO Community College were hired as survey interviewers. Each was required to obtain human subjects training and to be certified prior to conducting any recruiting or interviews. The interviewers used an IRB-approved form that explained the purpose of the interview, the respondents' rights as human subjects, compensation (a gift card) for their time, and the confidential nature of the survey. Interviewers were instructed not to begin the interview until all questions the participants may have were answered. All interviews were conducted in English and took an average of 30 to 40 minutes to complete.
