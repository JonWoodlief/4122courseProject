Wave I of the NYS occurred in 1977, when a national  probability sample of youths and one parent or legal guardian were  interviewed about events occurring in 1976 and about background and  demographic information. Follow-up surveys of youths occurred annually  from 1978 to 1981 (Waves II to V). Additional follow-up surveys of  youths occurred in 1984 (Wave VI) and 1987 (Wave VII). Separate  datasets for Waves I to VII were merged to create a single  longitudinal dataset, using SAS system software. Observations across  waves were linked by creating a common identifier based on household  and youth ID numbers. The NYS includes baseline information on youth  and family background and demographic characteristics, as well as  longitudinal data on the behaviors and attitudes of youths, and  youths' perceptions of parent, neighborhood, and peer group factors.  The longitudinal dataset contained one observation per study  participant and included measures of age at each wave, along with  measures of fixed demographics and background characteristics. The  dataset included measures of fixed risk factors (i.e., low SES and  parent beliefs legitimizing aggression), and it also included  wave-specific measures of violent offending and time-varying risk  factors. The researchers examined three time-varying risk factors  measured at Waves I to VII. Youths' beliefs legitimizing aggression  (BLA) were measured by averaging responses to two items pertaining to  the extent to which a respondent agreed that it is necessary (1) to  beat up someone to gain peers' respect and (2) to play dirty in order  to win. Bonding with delinquent peers (BDP) was calculated as the  product of a peer involvement score and a delinquent peers deviation  score, based on the work of Elliott and colleagues (1985). The  researchers measured involvement in conventional activities (ICA) as  the average of the standardized Family, School, and Community  Involvement Scales described by Elliott and colleagues (1985), in  Waves I to III, combined with a standardized aggregate measure of  employment in Waves IV to VII. These variables were coded so that higher scores consistently reflected higher levels of risk."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Self-reported violent offending was the dependent  variable of intere\nst.
