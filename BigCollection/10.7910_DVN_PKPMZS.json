West Asia (ancient Near East) is the oldest. In a previous study (Cioffi-Revilla and Lai 1995) using an earlier version of the data set presented in this paper with models of political uncertainty (Cioffi-Revilla 1998), we reported the first empirical findings on the origins and evolution of war and politics in ancient China (Legendary, Xia [Hsia], Shang, and Western Zhou [Chou] periods), ca. 2700 B.C. to 722 B.C. In this paper we make public for the first time the complete data set, expanded by several additional variables, explaining our sources and measurement procedures (N = 104 cases, version 2.0). These long-range data on the incidence of war ( ~ 103 years) should permit investigators to test numerous contending hypotheses, models and theories about warfare, including its distributions, different types of violent conflict (international wars, ethnic conflicts, civil wars, great power wars, protracted conflicts), time series, periodicity, system dynamics, and structural relationships (e.g., war-polarity theories). While some of these topics derive from and will hopefully extend extant research based on shorter-range data sets (e.g., modern Correlates of War Project range ~ 102 years), others will be new and focused on long-range dynamics. This new long-range data set should also promote a new stage in comparative analyses of the universal and particular properties of warfare and international systems, both cross-polity and longitudinally."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SSP"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Government"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Claudio Cioffi-Revilla and David Lai, “Chinese Warfare and Politics in the Ancient East Asian International System, ca. 2700 B.C. to 722 B.C.” International\r\n Interactions 26 (4) Jan. 2001: 1-32.  <a href=\"http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/crevilla/FileDownload/CB_cwp.pdf+?fileId=1814\" target= \"_new\">article available here</a>."}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Claudio Cioffi-Revilla"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://socialcomplexity.gmu.edu/director.php"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2001"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Murray Research Archive"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/logos/10/mra_logo.jpg"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[]},"customMRA":{"displayName":"MRA Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"mraCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Politics and Government","Replications, Extensions and Followups"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Documentation for this study","label":"CB_cwp.pdf ","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":133791,"categories":["1.
