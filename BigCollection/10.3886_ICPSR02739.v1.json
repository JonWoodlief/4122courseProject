Respondents  were recruited from four offices of the Michigan Employment Security  Commission (MESC) in southeastern Michigan. A group of 31,560  unemployed persons were approached for the study. Of these, about  23,000 failed to meet basic initial criteria because they were new  entrants to the labor market, already re-employed, or just  accompanying others in line. Respondents were kept in the pool if they  were not on strike and not expecting to be recalled for work in the  next few months or planning to retire in the next two years. The  resulting group of 7,956 were then assessed for symptoms of depression  and willingness to participate in a job-seeking skills seminar. These  final exclusion criteria resulted in a pool of 3,402. A screening  questionnaire (Part 1) was administered to that pool, which allowed  the researchers to classify respondents as being at high risk for  depression and anxiety or at low risk. All of the high-risk  respondents and a random sample of the low-risk participants were  invited to participate in the study and in the MESC's Job  Opportunities and Basic Skills II (JOBSII) intervention program, which  consisted of a set of job-search skills seminars. JOBS II was  patterned after JOBS I, which was offered by the MESC in the late  1980s. A pretest questionnaire (Part 2) was mailed to respondents  between February and July 1991, two weeks prior to the invitation to  participate in the JOBS intervention seminar. The questionnaire  addressed the situation surrounding the respondents' loss of  employment, quality of work life in previous job, level of economic  hardship, attitudes toward obtaining a new job, social support  network, self-esteem, feelings of anxiety and/or depression, health  problems, and substance abuse history and related problems. At the  same time, a mail questionnaire was sent to each respondent's  significant other (Part 6). Items in this questionnaire focused on the  length of their relationship with the respondent, the level of support  given to the respondent, the significant other's observations  regarding the daily activities of the respondent during this period of  job loss, the significant other's feelings of anxiety and/or  depression, and the significant other's level of economic hardship. A  second and third mail questionnaire were sent six weeks (Part 3) and  six months (Part 4) after the respondents' participation in a JOBS  intervention program job-seeking skills seminar. For those respondents  who had gained employment, questions were asked regarding current  employment status, sense of job permanence, employee benefits, and  feelings toward current job. Those respondents still seeking  employment were queried about their intention to continue their job  search, job-seeking behaviors, confidence in their ability to obtain a  job, and the presence or lack of a social support ne\ntwork. For those  respondents still unemployed six months after the intervention  seminar, additional questions covered receipt of unemployment benefits  and how necessary those benefits were. Similarly, significant others  were queried both six weeks (Part 7) and six months (Part 8) after the  respondents' participation in the job intervention. Topics focused on  their relationship with the respondent, the observed daily activities  of the respondent, the emotional support given to the respondent, the  respondent's job-seeking behavior, the respondent's and significant  other's feelings of anxiety and/or depression, and the level of shared  responsibility regarding the payment of bills and other economic  hardships. Finally, respondents were questioned through a mail survey  two years (Part 5) after their participation in the intervention  seminar about their employment status, quality of work life, financial  strain endured, social support system, relationship satisfaction,  self-esteem, feelings of anxiety and/or depression, health, and sense  of control. Significant others were also queried after two years (Part  9) regarding their relationship with the respondent, the significant  other's familiarity with the respondent's feelings of anxiety and/or  depression, their social support network, and the significant other's  feelings of anxiety and/or depression. Background information on  respondents includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent, education,  marital status, age of children in household, number of financial  dependents, and household income. Background information on  significant others includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent,  education, and employment status. Following the conclusion of the JOBS  intervention program, respondents were asked to complete a mail  questionnaire (Part 10) evaluating the effectiveness of the program  agenda and assessing the relevance of the seminar to their job search,  the effectiveness of the seminar trainers, inoculation against  setbacks, impact on their self-esteem, effect on their interviewing skills, and resume preparedness."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"anxiety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"depression (psychology)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"displaced workers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job loss"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job skills"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job stress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self esteem"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social support"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVI.A.
