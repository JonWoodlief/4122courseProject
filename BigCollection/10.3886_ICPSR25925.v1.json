Additionally, some households also received public education intervention, consisting of a leafleting and poster campaign and presentations at community and tenant association meetings.

Additionally, 403 households that reported incidents of elder abuse within the study's designated public housing projects were assigned to receive a home visit or to be part of the control group.

While the 1987 Domestic Violence Study and the Elder Abuse Study selected all incidents reported to the police, regardless of the nature of the criminal justice intervention, the PSA2 Study relied only on cases that involved an arrest.
