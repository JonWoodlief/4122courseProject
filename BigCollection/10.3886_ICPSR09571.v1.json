The first survey collected statistics on a small range of offenses and   on the criminal justice process for the years 1970-1975. The second   survey collected data on a wide range of offenses, offenders, and   criminal justice process data for the years 1975-1980. Several factors   make these two collections difficult to use in combination. Some 25   percent of those countries responding to the first survey did not   respond to the second and, similarly, some 30 percent of those   responding to the second survey did not respond to the first. In   addition, many questions asked in the second survey were not asked in   the first survey. This data collection represents the efforts of the   investigators to combine, revise, and recheck the data of the first two   surveys. The data are divided into two parts. Part 1 comprises all data   on offenses and on some criminal justice personnel. Crime data are   entered for 1970 through 1980. In most cases 1975 is entered twice,   since both surveys collected data for this year. Part 2 includes data   on offenders, prosecutions, convictions, and prisons. Data are entered  for 1970 through 1980, for every even year."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"convictions (law)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"correctional facilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime patterns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime reporting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international crime statistics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"persecution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trends"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United Nations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

These ten additional countries are Bulgaria, Cayman   Is\nlands, Gibraltar, Honduras, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Nigeria, Saudi   Arabia, Sudan, and Vanuatu. Similarly, the documentation for Part 2   indicates a total of 91 cases (countries), but there are actually 96.   The five additional countries are Bulgaria, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar,   Honduras, and Vanuatu. The original documentation further indicates 30   records per case. Two countries in Part 1, however, fall short of 30   records per case: Algeria and Mauritius. Algeria is missing one record   and Mauritius is missing 2 records. For both parts, where substantial   discrepancies occurred between the validation data collected through   the questionnaire, the questionnaire data were entered, unless they   appeared to deviate substantially from the overall pattern of the data.   This occurred in only a few instances. The following crime categories   could not be made comparable between the first and second surveys:   rape, drugs, judges, and totals. The term \"rape\" was not used in the   first survey. Instead, the phrase \"sex offenses\" was used. In the   first survey, the phrase \"substance abuse\" was used, and the   responses broken down into \"drugs\" and \"alcohol.\" The data recorded   for the first survey are for \"substance abuse\" with alcohol excluded.   The nearest equivalent to substance abuse in the second survey was the   category \"drug crimes.\" However, the first survey also requested data   on \"illegal traffic in drugs.\" This was not requested in the second   survey, although the variables are included in this data set, and some   data were entered into them from the validation questionnaires. The   first survey did not define \"judges.\" Consequently, no distinction   was made between professional and lay judges. The data of the second   survey report only professional judges. Total crimes was a separate   category in both surveys. It does not necessarily equal the sum of the   other crime categories collected in the survey. In some developing   countries, for example, often the gross total of all crimes was the  only information available.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1991-10-23"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1970"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1980"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data, and aggregate data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["These data represent the official statistics of member   countries of the United Nations and are drawn from the following   sources: (1) FIRST AND SECOND UNITED NATIONS WORLD CRIME SURVEYS, (2)   UNITED NATIONS QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF VIOLENCE,   (3) UNITED NATIONS WORLD CRIME SURVEY VALIDATION QUESTIONNAIRE, (4)  Yearbooks, Annual Reports, and Statistical Abstracts"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Africa"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Asia"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Europe"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Latin America"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"North America"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Global"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Member countries of the United Nations."]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Data on Offenders and Criminal Justice Personnel","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37475,"dataFile":{"id":2628099,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Data on Offenders and Criminal Justice Personnel","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Data on Offenders, Prosecutions, Convictions, and Prisons","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37475,"dataFile":{"id":2628100,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Data on Offenders, Prosecutions, Convictions, and Prisons","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
