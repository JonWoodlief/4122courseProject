In particular, it is a  study of children's social and psychological development from birth to  young adulthood in urban neighborhoods. This collection contains data  from a cross-sectional survey of Chicago residents in 1994 and is the  first product of an eight-year project. The survey gathered  information from adult residents of Chicago on their perceptions of  the neighborhoods in which they live. The survey questionnaire was a  multidimensional assessment of the structural conditions and  organization of the neighborhoods. Data collection consisted of a  household interview of residents aged 18 and older to assess key  neighborhood dimensions, including the dynamic structure of the local  community, organizational and political structure, cultural values,  informal social control, formal social control, and social  cohesion. Variables include measures of the best and worst aspects of  living in Chicago, how long residents had lived in a particular  neighborhood, characteristics of their neighborhood, including types  of social service agencies available, and if they would consider  moving to a different neighborhood and why. Other community variables  measure the relationships among\nneighbors, including how many  neighbors a respondent would recognize, how often neighbors  socialized, and how often neighbors participated in other activities  together. Variables that capture neighborhood social order include  respondents' perceptions of neighborhood problems such as litter,  graffiti, drinking, drugs, and excessive use of force by police.  Respondents were also asked about their normative beliefs regarding  violence, money, and various children's behaviors. Victimization  variables cover how often the respondent was the victim of a fight  with a weapon, a violent argument, a gang fight, sexual assault,  robbery, theft, or vandalism. Other variables measure fear of crime  and attitudes toward the police. Demographic variables include age,  gender, education, living arrangement, national origin, and employment  status. In addition, a number of scales created by the study's  scientific directors are included such as social disorder, perceived  neighborhood danger, and neighborhood activism.

In  particular, it is a study of children's social and psychological  development from birth to young adulthood in urban neighborhoods. The  project sought to answer the following questions: (1) Why does one  community have a high rate of crime, violence, and substance abuse,  while a similar community nearby is relatively stable? (2) What  factors enable some individuals to live successful, productive lives,  even in high-risk neighborhoods? (3) Why does one young person  experiment only briefly with delinquency, while another goes on to a  criminal career? The survey gathered information from adult residents  of Chicago on their perceptions of the neighborhoods in which they  live. The researchers sought to use these data to create reliable and  valid measures of neighborhood social context. Researchers were  interested in measuring how neighborhood social organization related  to crime, violence, and victimization. They also aimed to examine how  neighborhood social organization was related to social disorder,  cynicism regarding the legal system, dissatisfaction with the police, and tolerance of deviance."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Project on Human Development in Chicago  Neighborhoods was designed to administer a series of cross-sectional  community studies in the same area and at the same time as a  comprehensive longitudinal study on risk factors and manifestations of  antisocial behavior and substance abuse.
