This leak was widely condemned, including by the then Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. We assess the severity of the leak by considering the size of the disclosure relative to all diplomatic cables that were in existence at the timeÃ¢ÂÂa quantity that is not known outside of official sources. We rely on the fact that the cables that were leaked are internally indexed in such a way that they may be treated as a sample from a discrete uniform distribution with unknown maximum; this is a version of the well known Ã¢ÂÂGerman Tank ProblemÃ¢ÂÂ. We consider three estimators that rely on discrete uniformityÃ¢ÂÂmaximum likelihood, Bayesian and frequentist unbiased minimum varianceÃ¢ÂÂand demonstrate that the results are very similar in all cases. To supplement these estimators, we em- ploy a regression-based procedure that incorporates the timing of cablesÃ¢ÂÂ release in addition to their observed serial numbers. We estimate that, overall, approximately 5% of all cables from this timeframe were leaked, but that this number varies considerably at the embassy-year level. Our work provides a useful characterization of the sample of documents available to international relations scholars interested in testing theories of Ã¢ÂÂprivate informationÃ¢ÂÂ, while helping to inform the public debate surrounding ManningÃ¢ÂÂs trial and thirty-five year prison sentence."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gill, Michael, and Arthur Spirling.  \"Estimating the Severity of the WikiLeaks United States Diplomatic Cables Disclosure.\"  Forthcoming, Political Analysis."},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~spirling/documents/wiki_letter.pdf"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Dataverse"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/images/iqsslogo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-01-17"},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Forthcoming"}}}]}},"files":[{"description":"Contains codes for maximum likelihood, Goodman, and regression-based estimators of population size.
