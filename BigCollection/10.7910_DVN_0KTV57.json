Blacks and non-Hispanic whites participate at roughly equal rates, while Latinos and Asian-Americans are substantially less active. This variation may reflect culatural factors, or it may be the spurious product of differences in the distribution of non-ethnic determinants of participation, including socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, variables reflecting immigration history, including citicenzhip, and measures of group idintification. Using data collected in 1984 on samples of California's black, Latino, Asian-American, and non-Hispanic white populations, we conclude that these other variables fully account for lower Latino participation rates. Even with such controls, however, Asian-Americans remain less likely to vote. Athough non-citizens particiape less than citizens, they do engage in non-electoral activities. Finally, we specualte on the future political impact of Latinos and Asian-American, by projecting participation rates under several scenarios.\""}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Minorities and Race Relations"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"California"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cho, Wendy Tam.  “Naturalization, Socialization, Participation: Immigrants and (Non-) Voting.” Journal of Politics 61, 4 (November 1999): 1140–1155.\r\n</br></br>\r\nLien, Pei-te. 1994. “Ethnicity and Political Participation: A Comparison between Asian and Mexican Americans,” Political Behavior (16):237-264. \r\n</br></br>\r\nCain, Bruce E., D.
