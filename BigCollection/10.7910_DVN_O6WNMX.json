Within these directories: \r\n\r\nrRNA_Genostoma -- files containing this substring refer to analysis outcomes from the matrix constructed for the Adiaphanida-focused analyses. 18S rRNAs are in bases 1-1669; 28S rRNAs are in 1670-4649.\r\n\r\nrRNA_Genostoma_Neoophora -- files containing this substring refer to analysis outcomes from the matrix constructed for the pan-Platyhelminth analyses 18S rRNAs are in bases 1-1676; 28S rRNAs are in bases 1677-4542.\r\n\r\nWithin each directory, file names and contents are as default for the program used to generate the analysis (e.g. \"rRNA_Genostoma_Neoophora.nexus.run1.t\" contains the newick-formatted trees sampled during by the first MCMC of the MrBayes analysis of the pan-Platyhelminth matrix). Files ending in *out or *slurm refer to batch scripts and output used by the SLURM scheduler which was used to run the analyses in question on Harvard's Odyssey research cluster. Consensus trees as used in the paper are also generated in each respective directory, as .con.tre files.\r\n\r\nMultiple sequence alignment files (in phylip format and assorted other formats) are grouped in the  \"Alignments\" directory.\r\n\r\nTable S1 refers the reader, organized by the taxon names used in this paper, to the GenBank accession number used to obtain the specific rRNA sequence analysed for both 18S and 28S genes.\r\n\r\nThe \"Syromyatnikova 1949\" directory contains a pdf scan of the original Russian description of Ichthyophaga subcutanea (now Piscinquilinus subcutaneus), as well as a new English translation, courtesy of Matt Young."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Laumer, Christopher"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-04-03"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Genostoma_IB2016.7z","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":125335,"dataFile":{"id":3010522,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/O6WNMX/UCJ4JT","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/O6WNMX/UCJ4JT","filename":"Genostoma_IB2016.7z","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":253147098,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15b335df69b-8690228b7618","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0c725aa5139b89ebdbaf9e0d405f94cb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0c725aa5139b89ebdbaf9e0d405f94cb"}}}]}}}
