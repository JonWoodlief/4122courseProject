Respondents were asked whether they approved of George Bush's handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the economy, and relations with the Soviet Union, whether Bush had strong leadership qualities, and if it was possible that Bush had been involved in efforts to delay the release of American hostages in Iran during the 1980 Reagan presidential campaign. Questions regarding the Persian Gulf included whether respondents approved of Bush's handling of the situation with the Kurds, if the United States was doing enough to aid the Kurdish refugees, whether the actions of the United States in the Persian Gulf were partly responsible for the problems the Kurdish people were having with the Iraqi government, and whether the United States should have stopped or continued fighting when Iraqi troops left Kuwait. Questions focusing on Dan Quayle asked how favorably respondents viewed him, if his performance since becoming vice president made the respondent think better of him, whether he was qualified to serve as president, whether he had strong qualities of leadership, and whether he understood the complicated problems a president has to deal with. Also asked were questions regarding how confident the respondent was of Quayle's doing a good job if he became president, how concerned the respondent was that Bush might not be able to complete his term as president, and whether Bush's hospitalization for an irregular heartbeat increased concern about his ability to complete his term. Concerning the 1992 presidential campaign, respondents were asked whether they would vote for Bush or the Democratic candidate, whether Bush should keep Dan Quayle on the ticket as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1992, and whether replacing Quayle as Bush's running mate would make it more likely for respondents to vote for the Bush ticket. Additional questions pertained to the cyclone victims in Bangladesh, gun laws, gun ownership, bankruptcy, and job discrimination laws. Background information includes the respondent's voting behavior in the 1988 presidential election, party affiliation, political orientation, voter registration status, age, race, education, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"bankruptcy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush
