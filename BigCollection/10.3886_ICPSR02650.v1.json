This dataset contains systematic network data on respondents  and their contacts, information on the respondents' job search  activities, and employment history data. These data were col\nlected  from United States television station managers through a mail survey,  from October 1997 to January 1998. A systematic random sample of 609  managers was drawn from the Television and Cable Factbook, with 283  completed surveys returned. Respondents were asked to make comparisons  between their current and previous positions in the areas of benefits,  income, job prestige, station prestige, work experience, and  coworkers. Those queried were asked to describe their professional  business contacts both within and outside of the television industry,  and to comment on how those relationships affected their career  decisions. In addition, respondents were asked how much time they  devoted to keeping informed about job openings within their field, and  what sources provided them with such information. Specifically, they  were asked how many opportunities they learned of through trade  publications, newspapers, employment agencies and head hunters,  colleagues at other television stations, their current employer, and  other employers. Respondents were asked whether they found any jobs of  interest to them through those sources, whether they applied for the  positions, and whether they were offered a job. Background information  on respondents includes age, sex, education, marital status, number of  children in household, employment status and history, and the age and sex of their colleagues."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"broadcasting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career choice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupational mobility"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupational status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social networks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"television"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XV.A.
