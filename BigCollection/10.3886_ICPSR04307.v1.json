Two  of the parts were specialized domestic violence parts, and the third  was a jury trial part where domestic violence and other cases were  transferred if a negotiated disposition could not be reached. The  cases included were adjudicated between February 19, 1995, and March  1, 1996. The study consisted of 376 criminal court defendants who were  mandated to attend a 40-hour batterer treatment program or to complete  40 hours of community service. The random assignment was made at  sentencing, after all parties (judge, prosecutor, and defense) had  agreed that batterer treatment was appropriate, the defendant agreed  to batterer treatment and was accepted by the Alternatives to Violence  (ATV) program, and the program was available based on the random  assignment process. Batterers and victims were interviewed separately  to gather data regarding background information (violence histories  and demography), measures of new violence, beliefs about domestic  violence, conflict management skills, and locus of control. Several  measures of new violence were also included such as new arrests, new  crime reports (that may or may not result in an arrest), and  self-reports of violence by victims and batterers. In addition,  victims were administered a short scale measuring well-being. Upon  completion of the first interview, the defendant's name and case  identifier were entered onto\nthe next line of a logbook. Each line of  the book had a pre-assigned treatment designation (batterer treatment  or community service) determined through the use of a random number  table. Defendants assigned to the ATV batterer treatment program were  given a start date (usually within a week of intake). The interviews  were conducted on three occasions: at the time of sentencing (in  person with the batterer and via phone with the victim), at 6 months  after sentencing, and 12 months after sentencing -- via phone for  both the second and third interviews. Interviews at the three time  points were identical except for the omission of background  information on the second and third interviews. Official data on new  complaints to the police and new arrests were gathered 6 and 12 months  after sentencing, using computerized administrative records. With the  help of ATV administrators, an eight-week ATV course was developed for  this study based on the original model of 26 weeks where participants  could complete the same 40 hours of group time through bi-weekly  two-and-one-half hour sessions with lower fees per session. The new  format began to be offered after the first 129 participants had been  assigned to the original 26-week groups, therefore from August 15,  1995, until the end of intake, defendants were offered a choice  between 8-week and 26-week formats. Defendants rejected by lottery  from batterer treatment were mandated by judges to participate in 40  hours of community service. Typically, the service was performed over  a two-week period. For offenders who were employed, flexible hours  were arranged over a two-month period in order that they could  continue their jobs. Participants were assigned to work on renovating  housing units, clearing vacant lots to make way for community gardens,  painting senior citizen centers, and cleaning up playgrounds. In the  course of their service, participants were given education about drugs  and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Participants in both  forms of treatment were expelled if a pattern of nonattendance developed."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data collected in this study include demographic  information gathered about the batterer and the victim such as age,  race, ethnic group, educational attainment, employment status, job  type, income, and source of income.

Batterer-specific  variables include the type of treatment the batterer was assigned to,  the number of previous cases against the batterer, and the use of  substances. Victim-specific variables include the frequency, types,  and severity of abuse inflicted upon them and the type of assistance,  if any, they received (medical, social, financial, or psychological).

Batterers were only eligible for  inclusion in the experiment if all parties (prosecutor, defense, and  judge) agreed that batterer treatment was appropriate. Such agreement  was not forthcoming in a small percentage of cases, most often because  the defense refused to agree to treatment. Additionally, all  defendants had to agree to batterer treatment, be accepted to the  Alternatives to Violence (ATV) program, and the program needed to be  available to them based on the random assignment process. Since all  defendants had to agree to treatment, the study did not include cases  where batterers were unmotivated. However, all participants were  court-mandated -- they did not volunteer for treatment on their own  volition. Still, it was common knowledge in the Kings County (New  York) Criminal Court that misdemeanor batterer defendants were not  facing jail time, and participants in treatment certainly knew from  counsel that they were choosing the program over another alternative  to incarceration. In 28 percent of the control cases, judges overrode  the random assignment to deny batterer treatment and instead mandated  the ATV program for defendants who had been assigned to community  service. There were no judicial overrides of cases randomly assigned to the ATV program."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"face-to-face interview"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"none"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The response rate with victims was 50 percent for  the first interview, 46 percent for the second interview, and 50  percent for the third interview.
