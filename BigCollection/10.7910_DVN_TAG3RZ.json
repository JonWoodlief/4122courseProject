However, critical information  on  market  structure  and  value  of  intra-regional  fish  trade  needed  to  ensure  food security  in  the  West  African  corridor  are  very  limited.  This study therefore investigated the marketing nodes and structure for fish trade along Nigeria-Cameroon-Chad border. Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Benue, Taraba, Adamawa and Borno States along Nigeria-Cameroon Chad border were selected for this study. Snowball sampling technique was employed  for data collection.  The election  of  respondents  was  based  on  their  involvement  in  fishing  and  fish \r\nmarketing activities and their acceptance to provide the primary data for this research. Structured questionnaires were administered to 900 respondents comprising 300 producers, 300 processors and 300 marketers. The questionnaire was used to obtain data on socio-economic characteristics, \r\nmarketing operations, market structure, fish distribution and cross border trade in the study area. Data  were  analysed  using  descriptive  statistics,  budgetary  analysis,  Herfindahl  index,  Gini coefficient, stochastic production frontier model, linear regression analysis and ANOVA at α0.05.\r\nThe results of the study revealed that males 93.3% dominated the production node, while females dominated the processing (55.0%) and marketing (56.0%) nodes. Majority of the producers (34.3%), processors (34.0%) and marketers (39.7%) were within the age bracket of 41-50 years.  Majority  of  the  respondents  were  married;  87.7%,  88.3%  and  85.3%  and  secondary school leavers; 31.7%, 40.7% and 43.7% and they Majority of the respondents were members of marketers’ associations;  51.3%, 65.7% and 67.7% with marketing experiences (> 15  years for producers, 11-15 years for processors and 6-10 years for marketers). The empirical findings on Gini coefficients for actors in fresh fish production node (0.63, 0.53) and marketing node (0.43, \r\n0.43); smoked fish processing node (0.68) and marketing node (0.46, 0.39); dried fish processing node (0.69) and marketing node (0.51, 0.34) and frozen fish marketing node (0.36, 0.25) revealed an imperfect competitive market structure. Herfindahl index was highest for fresh (0.72), smoked (0.80) and dried (0.99) fish markets in Borno, Cross River and Adamawa States, respectively and frozen  (1.00)  fish  markets  in  Akwa  Ibom,  Cross  River  and  Borno  States.  Linear regression coefficient was positive in majority of the fish markets assessed. Processing node had the highest gross  margin  (₦371559.91±282965.56)  and  marketing  margin  (₦405394.09±392255.64),  and marketing  node  had  the  highest  marketing  efficiency  of  87.69±84.86.  Fresh fish (564.13±552.27kg) was the highest volume of fish sold in intra-State marketing. The bulk of inter State  and  intra-regional  inflow  and  outflow  trade  came  from  the  quantity  of  fresh (1250.64±703.53kg  and  1719.44±638.63kg,  respectively)  and  dried  (2098.00±306.88kg  and \r\n2205.11±987.43kg, respectively) fish products traded. \r\nThe processing node is the most profitable, the marketing node is the most efficient of the fish marketing nodes identified, and the marketing participants in the various nodes exhibited partial inequality and equality in the share of their monthly revenue. Hence, people should be encouraged to go into fish marketing as a source of livelihood being an efficient business venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Marketing nodes"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Fish Trade"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Profitability"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gini coefficient "}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Herfindahl index"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/sites/default/files/worldfish-logo.jpg"}},{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Ibadan, Nigeria"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Ibadan, Nigeria"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.ui.edu.ng/"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.ui.edu.ng/sites/all/themes/uiweb_theme/logo.png"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-10"},{"typeName":"contributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"contributorType":{"typeName":"contributorType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Funder"},"contributorName":{"typeName":"contributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/sites/default/files/worldfish-logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Muliro, Jacquie"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-04"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Nigeria"}},{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Cameroon"}},{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Chad"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data set for the assessment of marketing nodes and structure for fish trade along Nigeria Cameroon chad border","label":"Assessment of marketing nodes and structure for fish trade along nigeria cameroon chad border.tab","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":145746,"categories":["6.
