Respondents were asked about their current employment status and occupation, matters pertaining to work arrangements and leave options such as teleworking, work schedule flexibility, and taking sabbaticals, as well as activities that have an impact on their free time. Respondents were asked about their satisfaction with respect to various aspects of life including their job, health, and financial situation. Respondents were queried on the number of hours they worked per week, whether or not they intended to reduce their working hours and for how long, and what they would do with their extra free time. Respondents were also asked for their opinions about stress levels at work, compensation, working conditions, and job security. They were also asked at what age they would like to retire and at what age they expected to retire, whether they would consider postponing retirement for any reason, and what they would do with their extra time upon retiring. Other questions were asked about professional training completed by the respondents in the previous 12 months, whether they took time off of work to complete the training, who should be responsible for paying for such training and about their attitudes towards lifelong learning. Respondents were asked how many children under the age of 14 were living in their household and if the children's grandparents ever looked after them and wit\nh what frequency. In addition, respondents with grandchildren were asked if they ever looked after their grandchildren and whether or not they did so on a regular basis. Respondents also were asked a series of questions regarding product safety information with respect to 'Do-it-yourself' (DIY) products. Respondents were shown different logos that had appeared on DIY products and were asked if they were familiar with the various logos and if they knew what the logos said about the product. Respondents were asked if they took safety logos or other safety information into account when purchasing DIY products, whether or not they read instructions accompanying DIY products, whether they kept instructions for future use, where they thought the best location for instructions would be, whether they preferred safety instructions to be conveyed by logos or text, and whether or not safety information for DIY products was generally useful. Similarly, they were asked about product safety information regarding toys and other products for children. Respondents were also asked whether they took safety information into account when buying toys or children's products, whether they read safety instructions, and whether they kept safety instructions for future reference. Further, they were asked if they had seen certain logos on toys or other products for children and whether they knew what the logos said about the products. Respondents' opinions were sought regarding the most effective placement of safety instructions, whether they preferred the risks of using a toy or children's product to be indicated by logos or symbols or by text, and the usefulness of warnings appearing in text form. Finally, respondents were asked to make judgments on the overall usefulness of safety information for toys and children's products. Demographic and other background information collected includes respondent age, gender, marital status, nationality, left-right political self-placement, age at completion of education, occupation, household income group, type and size of locality, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leisure"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"product information"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"product safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"retirement plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"time utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"working hours"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
