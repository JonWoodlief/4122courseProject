This is the luminous central dominating source located in the massive and dense molecular clump associated with IRAS 16562$-$3959. The HRLs exhibit Voigt profiles, a strong signature of Stark broadening. We successfully reproduce the observed continuum and HRLs   simultaneously using a simple model of a slow ionized wind in local   thermodynamic equilibrium, with no need a high-velocity component. The Lorentzian line wings imply electron densities of $5\\times10^7$~cm$^{-3}$ on average.    In addition, we detect SO and SO$_2$ emission arising from a compact ($\\sim3000$~AU) molecular core associated with\nthe central young star. The molecular core exhibits a velocity gradient perpendicular to the jet-axis, which we interpret as evidence of rotation. The set of observations toward G345.4938+01.4677 are consistent with it being a young high-mass star associated with a slow photo-ionized  wind."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-09-26"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Astronomy and Astrophysics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ISM: jets and outflows --- radio continuum: stars --- stars: formation --- IRAS 16562$-$3959 --- G345.4938+01.4677"}}]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NNX12AI55G"}},{"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NNX10AD68G"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-12-20"}]},"astrophysics":{"displayName":"Astronomy and Astrophysics Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"astroType","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Cube"]},{"typeName":"astroFacility","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["ALMA"]},{"typeName":"astroObject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["G345.5"]},{"typeName":"coverage.Temporal","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"coverage.Temporal.StartTime":{"typeName":"coverage.Temporal.StartTime","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-07-28T04:41:32"},"coverage.Temporal.StopTime":{"typeName":"coverage.Temporal.StopTime","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-07-28T04:41:32"}}]},{"typeName":"coverage.Spatial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["(254.9234583333 -40.06211388889)"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"This is a FITS file with 1 HDU of type Image The following recognized metadata keys have been found in the FITS file, and their values will be made searchable in the DVN, once the study has been indexed:  HISTORY;
