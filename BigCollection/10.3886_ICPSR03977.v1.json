Its primary goal was to identify    risk factors for negative police behaviors and outcomes using    information readily available to the department. The PPD, like most    large police agencies, collects a lot of information on officers, both    before their appointment and in their work assignments. It was    anticipated that this information could be used to inform the    recruiting, screening, selection, and monitoring processes without    creating a large data collection burden. This study involved a    detailed consideration of individual officer characteristics, such as    background history and academy performance.

Background data were obtained through the Personal Data    Questionnaire (PDQ), which the PPD administers to academy applicants    who pass the entrance examination. Data are also provided for other    stages of the application/training process. Applicants had to pass a    polygraph, which they had two chances to do. Applicants were also    subjected to medical and psychological exams. In the academy, recruits    went through several training and evaluation phases for which numerous    exams were taken. Recruits wer\ne also subject to a disciplinary code    specific to the academy. Data on police officer misconduct after    graduation were obtained from databases maintained by the PPD Internal    Affairs Division (IAD) and the Police Board of Inquiry (PBI) and    departmental personnel files. The IAD granted access to their files    concerning Complaints Against Police (CAPS), internal investigations    (other than those for CAPS), and Use of Force Complaints. The PBI    database contained information regarding charges and subsequent    disciplinary actions for violations of the Department's Disciplinary    Code. Part 2, Survey Data, contains data collected in 2000 on the    attitudes of a sample of 499 PPD officers. The instrument included two    scaled measures. Twenty items on the survey comprised Regoli's (1976)    modification of Niederhoffer's (1967) cynicism scale, a measure of    police officer cynicism and distance from police supervisors, the    police department, and the public at large. Another 15 items comprised    a modified version of Krejei et al.'s (1996) attitudes toward ethics    scale.
