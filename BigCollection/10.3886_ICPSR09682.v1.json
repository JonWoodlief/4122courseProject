The objective of the act was to estimate the  incidence of five categories of children: children abducted by family  members, children abducted by nonfamily members, runaways, thrownaways  (those not wanted by their families or taken from families because of abuse  or neglect), and children considered missing. Data were collected by  several different methods. The centerpiece of this collection is a  household survey (Parts 19, 20, and 35) that interviewed families to  determine whether any children fit the categories under study. Basic  demographic information on age, race, and sex was collected, and questions  on the family situation were asked of identified children and their parents  and siblings. A survey of juvenile facilities (Parts 28 and 29) was also  conducted to determine how many children had run away from these  facilities. Facility administrators were prompted for demographic  information on the runaways as well as for information on the structure of  the runaways' families. In addition, a survey of returned runaways  (children who had run away and returned home) (Part 30) was completed to  find out whether children's accounts of runaway episodes matched the  accounts given by their parents. Children were queried about their  relationships with their parents and their views of their contributions to  the family. They were also asked about each specific runaway episode:  whether they actually ran away or were asked to leave, how long the episode  lasted, whether friends knew about it, whether friends accompanied them,  whether they used drugs before, during, or after the episode, how they were  found, where they were found, and whether disciplinary action was taken.  The police records component (Parts 31-33) contains information on homicides, abductions, and sexual assaults."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family relationships"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juveniles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"kidnapping"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"missing children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
