One project focused on the use of  computer-aided dispatch (CAD) systems in community policing,  specifically, the extent to which CAD systems can support community  policing and measure performance under new community policing  objectives. The other project involved conducting background research  for a guidebook on call management for community policing. This  guidebook was developed to show police agencies how different  strategies for managing calls could (1) free up officer time for  problem solving and other community policing activities, and (2) make  better use of call for service and other data to measure the success  of community policing efforts. A national survey was conducted for  this study because very little research had previously been done on  these topics. The survey was designed to address these specific  questions: (1) To what extent are police agencies currently using  various alternatives to providing immediate, sworn responses to  nonemergency calls for service (e.g., call stacking/delayed response,  telephone reporting units, mail-in and walk-in reporting, 3-1-1  systems, Internet reporting)? (2) To what extent are police agencies  using data captured by their CAD systems and other sources to help  plan and measure the success of their problem solving and other  community policing efforts? (3) What types of activities and  organizational changes commonly associated with community policing are  actually being implemented? (4) How do call management practices and  community policing activities vary with the size of jurisdictions? and  (5) What can be learned about promising and innovative call management practices currently being employed to enhance community policing?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A national sample of 695 police departments was  surveyed for this study. The Institute for Law and Justice, in  consultation with its funding agencies for both projects, decided there  was enough overlap in the purpose of the projects to create a single  survey instrument rather than surveying the same sample of agencies  twice. A 24-item questionnaire was developed with input from Institute  for Law and Justice staff, the National Institute of Justice, the Office  of Community Oriented Policing Services, and reviewers with backgrounds  in CAD, police response, and community policing and problem solving.  Survey questions wer\ne asked about departments' CAD systems as well as  their call management strategies and community policing activities. The  survey was mailed in May 2000.
