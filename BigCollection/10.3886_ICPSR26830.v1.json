This data collection polled respondents on their opinions before and after the 2008 presidential election held on November 4, 2008. In the original poll, fielded October 30-November 3, 2008, respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the presidency, whether their family was financially better off compared to four years ago, and whether a person's race affected their chances of getting ahead in today's society. Those who were registered to vote were asked about how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, their opinions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates, whether they had voted in a Democratic or Republican primary or caucus that year, the likelihood that they would vote in the general election and for whom, and whether they planned to vote in person on election day, by mail or absentee ballot, or at an early voting location. Other questions addressed respondent's willingness to participate in an exit poll or post-election telephone survey. After the election, 1,220 adults were re-interviewed in a call-back poll conducted November 7-10, 2008. Respondents who had voted were asked who they had voted for, when they had finally decided on a candidate, the main reason they chose that candidate, which voting method they used, how long they had waited in line to vote, and whether they were contacted by a presidential campaign. Those who did not vote were asked about the main reason they did not vote. All respondents in the call-back poll were asked whether progress had been made against racial discrimination since the 1960s, whether they were pleased with the outcome of the election, and their views on the upcoming Obama presidency. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, length of time at current residence, military service, religious preference, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Biden,
