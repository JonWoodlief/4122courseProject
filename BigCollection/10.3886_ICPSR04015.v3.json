Views were sought on the 2004 presidential campaign, as well as President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the economy, the situation with Iraq, and the campaign against terrorism. Respondents were asked whether the country was going in the right or wrong direction, whether the result of the war with Iraq was worth the human and economic costs, whether Iraq was a threat to the United States prior to the war, and whether the United States made the right decision in taking military action against Iraq. Several questions asked whether the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, had a negative or positive impact on the economy, whether the economy and the respondent's own financial situation was better or worse than when President Bush first took office four years ago, and the effect of the Bush administration's policies on jobs, taxes, the country's level of safety from terrorism, and the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly. Opinions were solicited on the seriousness of the current budget deficit, how serious of a problem it would be in the future, and whether the tax cuts enacted in 2001 should be made permanent, even if they increased the budget deficit in the future. Respondents were also polled on how much attention they paid to the 2004 presidential campaign, the likelihood that they would vote, whether they planned to vote for President George W. Bush, Democratic candidate John Kerry, or Independent candidate Ralph Nader, whether they had made their mind up yet, who they expected to win, the issue they most wanted candidates to discuss, and whether it was acceptable to use images of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in political campaigns. A series of questions addressed respondents' level of confidence in the ability of President Bush and John Kerry to correctly handle an international crisis and make decisions about the national economy, and whether each candidate's election would increase jobs, improve the economy, protect the country from terrorism, and ensure the future of Social Security benefits. Those polled also gave their opinions of the Democratic and Republican parties, and Vice President Dick Cheney. Additional topics addressed whether homosexualit\ny was a choice, whether respondents favored or opposed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, whether laws regarding marriage and civil unions should be determined by state or federal governments, and whether the issue of gay marriage should be a part of the election campaign. Background variables include sex, age, education, ethnicity, household income, religion, marital status, number of other telephone lines in household, political party affiliation, political orientation, and voter participation and registration
