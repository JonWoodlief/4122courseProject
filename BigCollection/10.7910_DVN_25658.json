The project received funding from the European Commission's Sixth Framework Programme under grant agreement number CIT5-CT-2005-028802. Additionally, the data for Stockholm was collected with funding from the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation and the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research; and the data for Oslo was collected with funding from the Research Council of Norway. All users of the datasets must agree to add the following acknowledgement of funding and production in any publication using these datasets:  \"Results presented in this paper/article/book/thesis stem from integrated datasets produced by the project âMulticultural Democracy and Immigrantsâ Social Capital in Europe: Participation, Organisational Networks, and Public Policies at the Local Level (LOCALMULTIDEM)â. This project was funded by the European Commission under the 6th Framework Programmeâs Priority 7 âCitizens and Governance in a Knowledge-Based Societyâ as a STREP instrument (contract no. CIT5-CT-2005-028802). The LOCALMULTIDEM consortium was coordinated by the University of Murcia (Dr Laura Morales), and was formed by the University of Geneva (Dr Marco Giugni), the University of Trento (Prof Mario Diani), the University of Bristol (Prof Paul Statham), the CEVIPOF â Sciences Po Paris (Dr Manlio Cinalli), the MTAKI (Dr Endre Sik) , and the University of Manchester (Dr Laura Morales). The data for Stockholm were collected by a team that included Prof Bo Bengtsson, Dr Gunnar Myrberg and Dr Per StrÃ¶mblad with funding from the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation and the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research. The data for Oslo were collected by a team that included Jon Rogstad with funding from the Research Council of Norway.\"  To be informed about the project and possible updates to the data, we encourage you to subscribe to our newsletter: https://listas.um.es/sympa/info/localmultidem_newsletter","metadataBlocks":{"citation":{"displayName":"Citation Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"title","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LOCALMULTIDEM and MDE Discursive Political Opportunity Structures (WP1) Dataset, 2004-2006"},{"typeName":"author","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cinalli, Manlio"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sciences Po Paris"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Borevi, Karin"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Uppsala University"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bozec, Geraldine"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sciences Po Paris"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Giugni, Marco"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Geneva"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Kohut, Tamas"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Morales, Laura"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Leicester"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pilati, Katia"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Trento"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Statham, Paul"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Bristol"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Varadi, Luca"}},{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Wiener, Noe"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Geneva"}}]},{"typeName":"datasetContact","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"datasetContactName":{"typeName":"datasetContactName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Laura Morales"},"datasetContactAffiliation":{"typeName":"datasetContactAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Leicester"},"datasetContactEmail":{"typeName":"datasetContactEmail","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"laura.morales@leicester.ac.uk"}}]},{"typeName":"dsDescription","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study contains the data collected through Workpackage 1 relating to Discursive Political Opportunity Structures of the Localmultide\nm project and through other related sister projects that formed part of the Multicultural Democracy in Europe (MDE) research network.
