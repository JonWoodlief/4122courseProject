One of the principal ways they can improve their accountability is by becoming more transparent, that is, offering more information to the public.  Over the past decade some IOs have adopted official policies and changed their practices concerning public access to information, while others have not.  This study asks which IOs are likely to be transparent.   To answer this question, it derives several hypotheses based on the existing international relations literature as well as the literature explaining government transparency in the domestic realm.  The hypotheses focus on the roles of the principal actors affecting access-to-information from IOs: member states, IO bureaucracies and international non-governmental organizations.  This study tests these hypotheses across seventy-two IOs by using three newly developed measures of transparency.  It finds that some of the main factors that explain IO transparency are analogous to those that have affected government transparency at the domestic level."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-09"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Transparency of Intergovernmental Organizations: The Roles of Member States, International Bureaucracies and Non-Governmental Organizations"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: This study was deposited under the of the Data-PASS standard deposit terms.
