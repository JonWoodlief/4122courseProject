The primary objective  of the study was to learn more about the application of anti-drug  tactics by police: What tactics are used by police to address drug use  problems? How widely are these tactics used? What new and innovative  tactics are being developed and applied by police? What anti-drug  tactics are most effective or show some promise of effectiveness? To  answer these questions, state and local law enforcement agencies  serving populations of 50,000 or more were mailed surveys. The survey  was administered to both patrol and investigation units in the law  enforcement agencies. This dual pattern of administration was intended  to capture the extent to which the techniques of one unit had been  applied by another. The questionnaire consisted primarily of  dichotomous survey questions on anti-drug tactics that could be  answered \"yes\" or \"no\". In each of the 14 categories of tactics,  respondents were encouraged to add other previously unidentified or  unspecified tactics in use in their agencies. These open-ended  questions were designed to insure that a final list of anti-drug  tactics would be truly comprehensive and capture the universe of drug  tactics in use. In addition to questions regarding structural  dimensions of anti-drug tactics, the survey also collected  standardized information about the law enforcement agency, including  agency size, demographic characteristics and size of the agency's  service population, and a description of the relative size and nature of the jurisdiction's drug problems."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The primary objective of this study was to learn  more about the application of anti-drug tactics by police: What  tactics are used by police to address drug problems?

Nearly 750  investigation and patrol units in the United States serving  populations of 50,000 or more were mailed surveys. Two surveys,  identical except for color coding and title, were sent to each  agency's chief of police: one survey was for completion regarding the  patrol unit and the other survey was for completion regarding the  investigations unit. This dual pattern of administration was intended  to capture the extent to which the techniques of one unit had been  applied by another. Basic data collection efforts began prior to  primary data collection with a comprehensive literature review and  consultations with panels of practitioner and academic drug experts.  These data were used to develop a listing of the various anti-drug  tactics that could be readily identified. This listing was designed to  cover both traditional and nontraditional or innovative tactics. Based  on the basic data collection, some 140 various drug tactics were  i\ndentified. Research staff participated in a meeting with an expert  advisory panel including law enforcement representatives to group the  various tactics into mutually exclusive, concise, and closely-related  categories of tactics. The survey instrument was designed to collect  information about the use of various drug enforcement tactics, improve  the comprehensiveness of the list of anti-drug tactics by soliciting  additional tactics, and gain more detailed insight into the nature of promising anti-drug tactics."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The questionnaire consisted primarily of  dichotomous survey questions on anti-drug tactics that could be  answered \"yes\" or \"no\".
