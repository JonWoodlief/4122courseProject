The ACSI tracks trends in customer satisfaction and provides valuable  benchmarking insights into the consumer economy for companies,  industry trade associations, and government agencies. It is based on  modeling of customer evaluations of the quality of goods and services  that are purchased in the United States and produced by both domestic  and foreign firms that have substantial United States market  shares. The ACSI model is a set of causal equations that link customer  expectations, perceived quality, and perceived value to customer  satisfaction. In turn, satisfaction is linked to consequences as  defined by customer complaints and customer loyalty -- measured by  price tolerance and customer retention. Customer expectations combine  customers' experiences with a product or service and information about  it via media, advertising, salespersons, and word-of-mouth. Customer  expectations influence the evaluation of quality and forecast how well  the product or service will perform. Perceived quality of a product  or service is measured through questions on its overall quality,  reliability, and the extent to which it meets the customer's  needs. Perceived value is measured through questions on overall price  given quality and overall quality given price. Customer complaints  activity is measured as the percentage of respondents who reported a  problem with the measured companies' product or service within a  specified time frame. Satisfaction has an inverse relationship to  customer complaints. Customer loyalty is measured through questions on  the likelihood that customers will purchase a company's products or  services at various price points. The ACSI is produced through a  partnership of the University of Michigan Business School, the  American Society for Quality (ASQ), and the international consulting  firm, CFI Group. Background variables include age, education, number  of family members, Hispanic origin, race, household income, sex, industry, and sector of the economy."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"advertising"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer expectations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"expectations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"expenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marketing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"products"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"purchasing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.A.
