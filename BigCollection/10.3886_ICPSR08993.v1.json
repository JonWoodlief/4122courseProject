The purpose was to collect data on the prevalence and incidence of mental disorders and on the use of and need for services by the mentally ill. The ECA Survey is the largest and most comprehensive survey of mental disorders ever conducted in the United States. The scope and complexity of the survey design were made possible because of the conflu\nence of the recent standardization of psychiatric diagnostic criteria and the availability of advanced computer data processing systems. Independent research teams at five universities (Yale, Johns Hopkins, Washington University, Duke University, and University of California at Los Angeles), in collaboration with NIMH, conducted the studies with a core of common questions and sample characteristics. The sites were areas that had previously been designated as Community Mental Health Center catchm\nent areas (New Haven, CN, Baltimore, MD, St. Louis, MO, Durham, NC, and Los Angeles, CA). The ECA encompassed a Household Survey and an Institutional Survey at each site, with two waves of personal interviews administered one year apart and a brief telephone interview in between. The structured psychiatric diagnostic interview used in the ECA was the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), version III (with the exception of the Yale Wave I survey, which used version II).  Diagnostic and Statis\ntical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition  (DSM-III) diagnoses derived from the DIS include manic episode, major depressive episode, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, schizophrenia, schizophreniform, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobia, somatization, panic, antisocial personality, and anorexia nervosa. The DIS elicits diagnoses across the respondent's full life span and also indicates when symptoms appeared during the last year (within last\ntwo weeks, last month, last six months, and last full year). The DIS uses the Mini-Mental State Examination to screen, when respondents appear confused, for cognitive impairment and inability to complete the interview, and continuation by a proxy interview."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cognitive impairment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental disorders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"needs assessment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"psychological evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
