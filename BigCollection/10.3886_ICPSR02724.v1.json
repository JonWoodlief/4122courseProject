Respondents were asked for their opinions of President Bill Clinton,  Vice President Al Gore, their state's governor, the United States  Congress, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Texas governor George W. Bush,  former Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole, former New Jersey Senator  Bill Bradley, former Vice President Dan Quayle, Arizona Senator John  McCain, former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, multimillionaire  publisher Steve Forbes, and conservative commentator Pat  Buchanan. Respondents were asked to assess the importance of a  political candidate's stance on a variety of issues as well as which  party is best able to handle those issues. Topics included crime, the  economy, foreign affairs, the middle class, moral values, Medicare,  the environment, partisanship, and tolerance. Those queried were asked  whether they believed the 1994 switch of congressional balance to the  Republican party had been a good or a bad thing. Given possible 2000  presidential races between Democratic hopefuls Gore and Bradley and  Republican hopefuls Bush and Dole, respondents were asked for whom  they would vote. Those queried were also asked for whom they would  vote in a Republican primary or caucus consisting of Bush, Dole,  Quayle, Buchanan, Forbes, Alexander, McCain, Family Research Council  president Gary Bauer, Ohio Congressman John Kasich, radio talk show  host Alan Keyes, and New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith. They were also  asked for whom they would vote in a Democratic primary or caucus  consisting of Gore, Bradley, and Reverend Jesse Jackson. Respondents  were asked whether the following characteristics made them more or  less likely to vote for a candidate for president: the candidate is a  woman, has used cocaine, has smoked marijuana, has never before held  elected office, is an environmentalist, has cheated on a spouse, has  lived and/or worked in Washington, DC, most of his/her life, has been  accused of improper campaign fundraising, supports legalized abortion,  was once a heavy drinker, and/or is supported by labor unions. A  series of questions addressed the situation in Kosovo, including  whether United States vital interests were at stake in the region,  whether the United States should bomb Serbia if Serbia did not agree  to a peace plan for Kosovo, and whether the United States and Europe  should use ground forces to enforce a peace treaty. Additional topics  covered the state of the nation's economy, possible uses for the  federal budget surplus, respondent enthusiasm for a 2000 presidential  race between Gore and Bush, and the 2000 congressional  elections. Background information on respondents includes age, race,  sex, education, religion, political party, political orientation,  voter registration and participation history, and labor union membership."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alexander,
