Subsequent questions dealt with the Clinton health care reform plan, the trustworthiness of the government in Washington, how Congress handled its job, the role of the United States in situations such as Bosnia and Somalia, handguns and crime, Michigan doctor Jack Kevorkian and physician-assisted suicide, and NFL football.
