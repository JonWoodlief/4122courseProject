These were cases in  which the stalkers were seeking revenge and/or reconciliation through  stalking. Data were collected from 187 female stalking victims during  1991-1995 living in Chester, Delaware, Bucks, Philadelphia, and  Montgomery counties in southeastern Pennsylvania. Data collection was  comprised of an extensive, semistructured, face-to-face interview  conducted with each woman to gather information concerning the nature  of the stalking, the relationship between the victim and the stalker,  the victim's response to the stalking, the consequences of the  stalking for the victim, the needs of stalking victims in general, and  fulfillment of those needs in terms of victim services and interaction  with and cooperation from the criminal justice system. A brief survey  questionnaire was also administered to obtain demographic information  about each victim and her stalker. Content analysis of the interview  transcripts was used to identify variables. Each variable fell into  one of six categories: (1) victim's prior relationship with the  stalker, (2) characteristics of the stalking, (3) victim's attempt to  discourage the stalker (through both legal and extralegal mechanisms),  (4) assistance sought by the victim through formal and informal  networks and the subsequent handling of the situation by others, (5)  the physical and emotional effects of the stalking on the victim, and  (6) other victimization experiences.

However,  previous research on stalking and victims of stalking has been  scant. Most research addressing the stalking issue has been either  primarily legal in nature or focused solely on high-profile cases  involving celebrities and political leaders, although victims of  stalkings are, more often than not, \"everyday, ordinary people.\" Few  studies have investigated the incidence and nature of noncelebrity  stalking victimization. Moreover, these studies have often  concentrated on many different types of stalkings (e.g., current  intimate, former intimate, acquaintance, stranger, erotomanic, and  sociopathic/psychopathic stalkings), rather than researching any one  particular type of stalking. The purpose of this study was to explore  the nature of the stalking experiences of noncelebrity stalking  victims who had previously been in an intimate relationship with their  stalkers. These were cases in which the stalkers were seeking revenge and/or reconciliation through stalking."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were collected from 187 female stalking  victims during 1991-1995 living in Chester, Delaware, Bucks,  Philadelphia, and Montgomery counties in southeastern Pennsylvania.

The specific  interview questions were based on a review of the limited literature  on stalking, as well as on general victimization literature. Each  interview, lasting between one and three hours, consisted of both  open-ended and fixed alternative questio\nns, and respondents were  allowed to elaborate following every question. Each interview began by  requesting the victim to describe her stalking victimization in her  own words. Responses to this question lasted anywhere from five  minutes to two hours. Following the initial question, the remaining  interview questions were asked. Due to the nature and length of the  interviews, each interview was tape-recorded and later  transcribed. Content analysis of the interview transcripts was used to  identify variables. However, because of the semistructured approach  taken in conducting the interviews, not all respondents provided data  pertaining to every variable.
