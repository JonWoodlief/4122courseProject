Data on crime offense reports and computer aided dispatch (CAD) drug calls and shots fired calls were collected from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Bureau of Police for the years 1990 through 2001. Data on crime offense reports were collected from the Rochester, New York Police Department from January 1991 through December 2001. The Rochester CAD drug calls and shots fired calls were collected from January 1993 through May 2001. A total of 1,643,828 records (769,293 crime offense and 874,535 CAD) were collected from Pittsburgh, while 538,893 records (530,050 crime offense and 8,843 CAD) were collected from Rochester. ArcView 3.3 and GDT Dynamap 2000 Street centerline maps were used to address match the data, with some of the Pittsburgh data being cleaned to fix obvious errors and increase address match percentages. A SAS program was used to eliminate duplicate CAD calls based on time and location of the calls. For the 1990 through 1999 Pittsburgh crime offense data, the address match rate was 91 percent. The match rate for the 2000 through 2001 Pittsburgh crime offense data was 72 percent. The Pittsburgh CAD data address match rate for 1990 through 1999 was 85 percent, while for 2000 through 2001 the match rate was 100 percent because the new CAD system supplied incident coordinates. The address match rates for the Rochester crime offenses data was 96 percent, and 95 percent for the CAD data. Spatial overlay in ArcView was used to add geographic area identifiers for each data point: precinct, car beat, car beat plus, and 1990 Census tract. The crimes included for both Pittsburgh and Rochester were aggravated assault, arson, burglary, criminal mischief, misconduct, family violence, gambling, larceny, liquor law violations, motor vehicle theft, murder/manslaughter, prostitution, public drunkenness, rape, robbery, simple assaults, trespassing, vandalism, weapons, CAD drugs, and CAD shots fired."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this study was to develop crime  forecasting as an application area for police in support of tactical  deployment of resources. The crime forecasting methods and models  included (1) a multivariate model for estimating crime seasonality  based on demographic and land use demographics, and (2) leading  indicator models with 4 and 12 time lags. An application of tracking  signals as a supporting crime analysis tool to automatically detect crime series pattern changes was also introduced."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The crime data collected for this study were from  two Northeastern, mid-sized cities: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and  Rochester, New York. The researchers had previously collected all  crime offense reports and computer aided dispatch (CAD) calls from the  Pittsburgh Bureau of Police for the years 1990 through 1998. The  current study added the years 1999 through 2001. Since Pittsburgh  started using a new record management system in 2000, all of the 1990  through 1999 data had to be reprocessed to ensure that the 1999 data  were treated identically to the 1990 through 1998 data and to make as  sm\nooth a connection as possible to the new format of the 2000 and 2001  data. The 1990 through 1999 offense datasets were in 17 flat files  extracted from an old mainframe system. Oracle SQL Loader was used to  import the data into an Oracle database. The imported data were in 13  tables. The tables were then exported into an Access database. In  Access, links were created between the tables and various queries were  created to limit crime records to offenses only. Several fields were  concatenated to get a complete street address for each crime record. A  crime code table, created by the researchers, was joined to the  database so that each crime record would have a consistent descriptive  crime name that matched the Rochester data. The resultant table  containing the Pittsburgh offense data for 1990 through 1999 has  637,166 records. The Pittsburgh offense data for 2000 and 2001 were  taken from an Oracle database. The 132,127 records were appended to  the earlier data, with a crime code table added so each crime record  has a descriptive major code. The Pittsburgh CAD data have 874,535  records. Only CAD drugs and CAD shots are used in the forecast  models. CAD data could not be obtained for November and December of  1999. Instead, simple exponential smoothing was used to forecast those  two months, and the forecasts are used as data values in the datasets.  A SAS program was used to eliminate duplicated CAD calls based on the  time and location of the calls. The total number of crime offense and  CAD records for Pittsburgh is 1,643,828. ArcView 3.3 and GDT Dynamap  2000 Street centerline maps were used to address match the Pittsburgh  data. Some data were cleaned to fix obvious errors and increase  address match percentages. For the 1990 through 1999 crime offense  data the address match rate was 91 percent. The match rate for the  2000 through 2001 crime offense data was 72 percent. The CAD data  address match rate for 1990 through 1999 was 85 percent, while for  2000 through 2001 the match rate was 100 percent because the new CAD  system supplied incident coordinates. Once the data addresses were  matched, spatial overlay in ArcView was used to add geographic area  identifiers for each data point: precinct, car beat, car beat plus,  and 1990 Census tract. Car beat plus is an aggregation of car beats  designed to increase monthly average crime volumes while keeping the  resultant districts from crossing precinct boundaries and maintaining  compact areas. Car beats are aggregations of census tracts and were  the patrol districts used by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police during  the study period. The next step was to aggregate a number of crime  types to monthly times series for each geography. The Rochester  offense data contain 530,050 records from January 1991 to December  2001. All files were imported and processed in Access. The Rochester  CAD records contain data from January 1993 to May 2001 and 3,767,002  records. However, only the 8,843 records containing the CAD shots and  drugs data were used. Again, SAS was used to eliminate duplicate CAD  calls. The total number of crime offense and CAD records for  Rochester is 538,893. ArcView 3.3 and GDT Dynamap 2000 Street  centerline maps were also used to address match the Rochester data. No  data cleaning was necessary. The address match rates for the Rochester  crime offenses data was 96 percent, and 95 percent for the CAD data. Spatial overlay followed in the same fashion as in Pittsburgh."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data include an identification number for the  observations unit's geography: tract, beat number, beat plus number,  or precinct number.
