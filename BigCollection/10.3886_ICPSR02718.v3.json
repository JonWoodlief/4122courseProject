Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and to comment on whether they would watch the State of the Union address on Tuesday, January 19, and whether C\nlinton would be able to achieve his policy goals for the following year. Additional questions focused on whether Clinton's actions with respect to former White House intern Monica Lewinsky warranted removal from office, whether Clinton should be censured or impeached, and whether the impeachment trial would affect the country in a negative way. Respondents were also asked to give their opinions of Vice President Al Gore, United States Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Illinois Congressman Henry Hyde, Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, and the Republican and Democratic parties. Those queried were asked if they trusted the government in Washington, DC, whether Congress would accomplish more or less in the next two years, whether they were following the impeachment trial, whether they approved of the Senate's handling of the trial, and whether there should be a full trial with witnesses and testimony. Views were also sought on whether the Senate could act in a nonpartisan way, whether the Senate was handling the impeachment trial better than the House of Representatives, whether the Senate spent too much time bickering, and whether the Senate paid attention to the opinions of the American people. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, political party, political orientation, voter participation history, marital status, age of children in household, family income, and computer access."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
