Through a telephone survey, respondents were asked a series of questions about their awareness of, access to, understanding of\n, and usage of computers, electronic mail, the Internet, and online services. Those queried were asked whether their contact with this technology was limited or extensive and for work or personal use, whether computers and the Internet created or solved problems, whether the Internet had an adverse effect on interpersonal communication, and whether the Internet was important to work and personal productivity. A series of questions probed for respondents' experiences using the Internet to obtain the latest financial and sports news, product information, and travel information, to purchase products or travel tickets, to make hotel reservations, and to search and/or apply for a job. Respondents were asked about their knowledge of and experiences with the websites and online services of E-bay, Amazon.com, E-trade, CBS.Marketwatch.com, AOL.com, Yahoo, Sidewalk.com, and Priceline.com. Respondents were also queried about stock market investments and the Internet, including whether they had bought or traded stocks through the Internet, how frequently they checked their investments through online services, and whether they owned stock in Internet companies. Further questions focused on the future of the stock market, extending the stock market trading day to 24 hours, day traders' knowledge of the stock market and their influence on it, whether many people are getting rich off the Internet, purchasing holiday gifts online, and the possibility of year 2000 (Y2K) computer-related problems. Respondent views were also sought on the upcoming 2000 presidential election, including the Democratic and Republican primaries/caucuses. Respondents were asked for whom they intend to vote: Vice President Al Gore, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, Texas governor George W. Bush, Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, Family Research Council President Gary Bauer, talk show host Alan Keyes, Utah senator Orrin Hatch, or former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole. The results of this survey were announced on the CBS website CBS.Marketwatch.com. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, education, religion, marital status, employment status, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
