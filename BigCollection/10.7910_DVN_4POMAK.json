The objectives of the study were to determine the extent to which various aspects of a college community can affect the lives and development of students, by examining both the development of individuals within a particular social system, and the impact of the system on the individuals. The study also sought to assess the extent to which changes experienced during college could be predicted from students' pre-college backgrounds.\r\n<br /> <br />  Using semi-structured interviews and projective tests, numerous aspects of personality were examined. These included cognitive style, coping patterns, attitudes and values, object relations, self-esteem, mood, and ego integration and control. Variables assessed included time spent dating and studying, self-confidence and creativity, aggression, dependence, authoritarianism and ethnocentrism, individualism, religiosity and liberalism.<br />
