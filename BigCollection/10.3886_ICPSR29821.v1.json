RDS is a chain-referral recruiting method where participants recruit additional participants in recruitment chains. To better understand how social networks among methamphetamine users and distributors are structured, function, and evolve over time, the researchers collected network data from respondents to understand the complexity of linkages in user and distribution networks. The study used a mixed data-collection interview technique that captured both quantitative and qualitative data in a single interview; the interviewer conducted an open-ended, but structured interview, entering data on a computer database form, while simultaneously employing a stereo recorder to record the entire interview for subseque\nnt selective transcription and analysis. After a period of formative research, the data collection phase of the study used RDS to recruit 132 methamphetamine market participants. Each study participant did a roughly 1-2 hour structured interview that recorded participant demographics (Basic Roster Data and Roster Data; Datasets 1 and 2), enumerated and described the members of their drug use and distribution networks including drug buying, selling, trading, and in-kind transaction partners (Ego Network Data and Respondent Driven Sampling Network Data; Datasets 3 and 4), and described drug use patterns and market participation (Methamphetamine Obtaining Data, Providing for Others Data, Criminal Justice Data, and Consumer Data;  Datasets 5-8). Each participant was invited to recruit three additional eligible participants according to the RDS protocol; they were given three numbered coupons that they were instructed to pass along to other people they know who currently participate in retail methamphetamine markets, as buyers, sellers, and/or users. Participants were instructed to return one month after their initial interview date to collect recruitment incentives and complete a follow-up interview that focuses on changes in patterns of use, distribution or network membership since the first interview. To determine eligibility, the researchers developed a screener that asked potential participants about drug use and preparation techniques, folkloric beliefs related to methamphetamine use, and market conditions and prices."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>Each dataset has a mixture of quantitative and qualitative (open-ended response) data, as well as derived/re-coded variables computed by the principal investigators.

Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a methodology that is used to recruit samples of hard-to-reach groups by taking advantage of intragroup social connections to build a sample pool. In order to initiate the RDS sample chains, the research team placed 33 ads on craigslist.org from February 2008 (to recruit Formative Research interviewees) through September 2009 (to recruit RDS seeds to initiate new recruitment chains). This drew many phone calls to the toll-free number the research team set up and 105 emails from potential participants. The researchers scheduled more than 300 appointments over the data collection period, with many no-shows and repeated re-schedulings around potential participants' often busy schedules. The research team also regularly placed flyers on bulletin boards at local MSM (men who have sex with men)-oriented organizations, although no participants were recruit\ned as a result of these flyers. Seeds were also recruited through a local harm-reduction program's Crystal Meth Support Group.</p>\n\n<p>Following the initial interview, initial \"seeds\" and subsequent waves of study participants were given three numbered coupons that they were instructed to pass along to other people they know who currently participate in retail methamphetamine markets, as buyers, sellers, and/or users. The numbers on these coupons allowed the research team to prevent duplication, to identify who recruited each participant and to keep track of subsequent recruitment patterns using the RDS Coupon Manager software. In order to reduce the likelihood that too many respondents would come from a small number of well-connected people, the researchers limited the recruitment potential of each participant with the rationing of coupons. Researchers also included a 30 day expiration date on the coupons in an attempt to ensure a reasonable pace of sample recruitment. Brief recruiter training sessions were conducted with the seeds and each subsequent eligible respondent, explaining: recruitment criteria; incentives for interviews and recruiting ($50 and $20 respectively); how recruits should contact the project; the time limit and sample size limit on recruiting; and discussion of appropriate recruiting techniques to avoid coercion and ensure participation was voluntary. When necessary, researchers selected new seeds because recruitment chains were slow to develop; many participants did not recruit. Of the 132 subjects interviewed, 28 percent (37 individuals) were seeds in the RDS process. Of these 37 seeds, 38 percent (14 individuals) produced referrals. More than seventy persons attempted to participate in the study who were not in fact eligible, as far as could be determined after screening.
