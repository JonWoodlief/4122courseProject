This call-back poll reinterviewed 518 respondents who had participated in a CBS News poll conducted September 21-24, 2008. This dataset contains responses to the call-back questions as well as to questions in the original poll, which asked how much attention respondents were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, their opinions of the candidates, their vote in the primaries, the likelihood that they would vote for president in the general election, for whom they would vote if the election were held that day, and the effect of the vice-presidential candidates on their vote. Additional questions asked about the condition of the national economy, respondent's personal finances, and whether the federal government should provide financial help to homeowners who were having trouble repaying their mortgages. In the call-back poll, respondents were reinterviewed about how much attention they were paying to the 2008 presidential campaign, their opinions of the candidates, the likelihood that they would vote in the presidential election, the effect of the presidential debates and the vice-presidential candidates on their vote, whether their opinions of the candidates had changed since the last poll, and if so, why they had changed their mind. Those who had already voted in the presidential election were asked for whom they had voted. Views were also sought on the condition of the national economy. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, household income, employment status, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status and participation history, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian, and whether a child under 18 years of age was living in the
