The conducted experiments give reasons to note the following: speaking in majority of five years old children (89%) is spontaneous and situational; it is mostly involuntary, unintentional, unconscious (is interpreted only its content), not reflexed and almost uncontrollable. Deployed expressions of children develop at this age on the base of spontaneous reflexion over the speech and on their natural metalinguistic abilities if there is speech environment with high developmental potential. As for broadcasting as an activity, its features already begin to occur in 11% of five years old children, whom we referred to a high level of development, which gives reasons to consider this sensitive age possible for psycho linguodidactic influences. Speech operations owned by 11% of five years old children (high level) is for other children (89%) the nearest area of speech development. Prospects for future research consist in studying the state of speech activity development of six years old children after the introduction psycho linguodidactic technology."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-01"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Shymko, Vitalii"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-13"}]}},"files":[{"label":"_Kalmykova_2016_Psycholingua(19,1).pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":141682,"dataFile":{"id":3221429,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/ENIILL/3WEZFV","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ENIILL/3WEZFV","filename":"_Kalmykova_2016_Psycholingua(19,1).pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":251449,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165d2f2a8c9-66b5ef687d18","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4cfc9f5791a1589c9c8e8726ea5ff21a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4cfc9f5791a1589c9c8e8726ea5ff21a"}}}]}}}
