We examine the trends in confidence in subnational government using an aggregate level approach. First, we consider whether levels of trust are defined by reactions to the national government. Second, we consider how factors specific to subnational politics such as governmental performance and the quality of community life influence trust. Using measures of confidence in state and local government from 1968 to 2004 and a set of error correction models, we find evidence for both accounts. Confidence in subnational governments reflects national trends such as economic tides and public preferences for more or less government, but also exhibits unique dynamics explained by factors specific to subnational politics."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Wolak, Jennifer, and Christine Kelleher Palus.  2010.  “The Dynamics of Public Confidence in U.S. State and Local Government.” State Politics and Policy Quarterly 10(4): 421-445."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-06-27"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data set","label":"confidence time series data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54863,"dataFile":{"id":2417217,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"confidence time series data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":6394,"description":"Data set","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:89350","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:gyBIPGqDMmupR5iRHeDs5Q==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"faeb19ec96a34523e4fd0defea0cebda","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"faeb19ec96a34523e4fd0defea0cebda"}}},{"description":"Do file","label":"confidence time series models.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54863,"dataFile":{"id":2417216,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"confidence time series models.do","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":2329,"description":"Do file","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:89351","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"991d739c989866d18ccf60d5c9a7e6f7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"991d739c989866d18ccf60d5c9a7e6f7"}}}]}}}
