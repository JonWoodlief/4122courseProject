During this period, most large insurance companies left  the market as many large corporations began to set up their own  insurance plans and as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and  other managed care networks began to make significant inroads into the  health care market. Particularly hard hit was the small group market  comprised of employees of small companies and self-employed  individuals. Small business owners saw their health insurance costs  rise dramatically and many were unable to find insurance for their  employees at any cost. The second change provided the means for  committing fraud in the small group market. In 1974, Congress passed  the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the primary  purpose of which was to safeguard employee pension plans. While  ERISA's provisions were intended to make it easier for employers,  labor unions, and other organizations to provide health benefits to  employees, the unintended effect was to open the doors to con artists  who saw in these provisions the legal loopholes that would become the  vehicles for massive fraud. The focus of this data project was insider  fraud -- crimes committed by the owners and operators of insurance  companies that were established for the purposes of defrauding  businesses and employees. The main questions addressed were: (1) What  are the larger structural causes of fraud in the small business health  insurance industry? (2) What are the principal forms that it takes?  and (3) What policy changes have been or might be effected that would reduce fraud in the industry?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"One of the problems that has hindered research on  white-collar crime has been the general lack of  systematically-collected quantitative data.
