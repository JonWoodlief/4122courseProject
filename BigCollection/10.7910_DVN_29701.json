In designing and deploying REDD programs, the UN is asking that participating nations go beyond focusing just on technical issues associated with carbon management and also include a range of social considerations; for example, program managers are being asked to undertake stakeholder-based processes aimed at incorporating community concerns in program design, implementation, and management. The research reported here discussed the application of structured decision making to the design of REDD programs in Vietnam. The goal of structured decision making is to place the values, objectives, and concerns of stakeholders squarely in front of managers so that they may lend maximum insight to decisions that require trade-offs across environmental management options."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision aiding,     PES,     REDD,     stakeholder engagement,     trade-offs,     Vietnam"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Kenney, L.
