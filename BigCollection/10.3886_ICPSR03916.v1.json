Respondents were asked to give their    opinions of President George W. Bush and his handling of the    presidency, foreign policy, the economy, and the situation with Iraq.    Their views were sought on the state of the economy and how it    compared to the state of the economy two years ago. A series of    questions addressed pre-emptive military strikes and interference in    foreign governments, whether the costs of the Iraq War or the removal    of Saddam Hussein was worth the loss of American lives, and whether,    in retrospect, Iraq and Saddam Hussein had posed real threats to the    United States. Respondents were asked what they felt Iraqi sentiment    was toward the United States and if they thought the United States was    really in control of events in Iraq. Respondents were asked to give an    estimate on how long American troops would be in Iraq, and whether    that was too long, about right, or not long enough. Those polled were    asked if they thought the war will have been \"worth it,\" if they would    consider it to be \"worth it\" if no weapons were ever found, whether    the Bush Administration's estimates on the number of weapons Iraq had    were accurate, and whether those in the administration were telling    the truth about what they knew. Respondents were also asked if they    were confident that the United States would find weapons of mass    destruction in Iraq and whether or not it mattered. Questions    concerning the upcoming presidential election asked those polled how    much attention they paid to the 2004 campaign, and if the respondent    could name any of the Democratic candidates for president. Background    information on respondents includes voter registration status, party    identification, voting record in the 2000 election, marital status,    religious preference, education record, age, Hispanic nationality,    racial background, total family income in the year 2002, and reachable   call-back phone numbers."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hussein, Saddam"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Iraq War"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public approval"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
