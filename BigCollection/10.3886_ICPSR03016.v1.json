The purpose of this project was to update the benchmark findings from an earlier survey of Vermont residents in 1994, to assess public attitudes about the reforms and changes that had been instituted by the Vermont DOC, and to explore the possibility of expansion of responsibilities of the reparative community boards. This project involved a telephone survey of a new sample of 601 adult residents of Vermont. The interviewing was conducted on March 15-21, 1999. Respondents were asked a series of trend questions to update the 1994 findings. Respondents were also asked questions about two other programs: the diversion program, in which selected first offenders who fulfilled the terms of a community-based sanction could have their records expunged, and the furlough program, in which offenders making the transition from prison to the community were supervised for an interim period. The survey also explored whether Vermonters would like to see the responsibilities of the reparative boards expanded to include community notification and other types of cases. Residents assessed whether crime in general, violent crime, and illegal drug use had increased compared to five years prior, whether more prisons should be built, whether Vermont's jails and prisons were overcrowded, and whether violent offenders were being released before completing their sentences because of overcrowding. They commented on how often offenders in four scenarios should go to prison and how often they believed that these offenders in fact did go to prison. Respondents rated the performance of various segments of the Vermont criminal justice system and, given 15 offense scenarios, were asked whether the offender should spend time in jail or in community service and rehabilitation. In addition, respondents were asked whether anyone in their household had been a victim of a crime within the last three years and, if so, whether it was a violent crime.

The reform program  involved the design of an array of innovative intermediate sanctions  programs that ran along two tracks. For offenders whose behavioral  problems presented a risk to public safety, planners designed targeted  treatment options, a work camp, and a violent offender program within  the prison system. For less serious, nonviolent offenders, the  planners undertook a reshaping of community supervision practices with  the adoption of \"reparative probation.\" This involved the  establishment of community boards that determined how each offender  could make amends for harm done, and the creation of a revolving  restitution fund to assure that victims could receive just  compensation (also known as \"restorative justice\"). In March 1994, the  new plan was ready for implementation and was tested by the DOC for  public acceptability using public opinion research techniques,  including a statewide telephone survey of 400 residents. The DOC  incorporated the results of this first survey into the series of  changes in the criminal justice system that were being implemented. By  the summer of 1998, the Vermont DOC had completed three years of  operational experience with restorative justice. The purpose of this  project was to update the 1994 benchmark findings, to assess public  attitudes about the reforms and changes that had been instituted, and  to explore the possibility of the expansion of the responsibilities of the reparative boards."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The researchers conducted a telephone survey of a  new sample of 601 adult residents of Vermont.

The questionnaire was pretested for length and  understandability twice, each time with ten Vermonters selected at  random.
