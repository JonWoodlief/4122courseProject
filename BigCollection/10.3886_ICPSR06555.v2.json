The survey posed questions regarding who  had better ideas -- the President or Congress -- on topics such as  cutting taxes, reducing crim\ne, reducing the federal budget, and health  care reform. In the post-address portion of the survey, respondents to  the initial survey who called a toll-free phone number immediately  after the speech answered six additional questions via an automated  polling program: (1) Whether the respondent approved of the proposals  the President made in his State of the Union message, (2) whether the  respondent now had a clear idea of what Bill Clinton stood for, (3)  whether the Republicans were doing a better job of running Congress, a  worse job, or about the same job as the Democrats had done, (4)  between President Clinton and the Republicans in Congress, who the  respondent thought better understood the major problems facing the  country, (5) who better understood the needs and problems of people  like them, and (6) who was more likely to bring about the changes in  government they would like to see. Background information on  respondents includes voter registration status, household composition,  vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, political party,  political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
