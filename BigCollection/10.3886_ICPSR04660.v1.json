Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way President George W. Bush was handling the presidency and issues such as the federal budget deficit and the economy, whether they approved of the way the United States Congress and their own representative were doing their jobs, and which political party they trusted to handle the main problems the country would face in the next few years. Several questions asked how closely respondents were following the upcoming November 2006 election, whether they would vote for a Democratic or Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives, the reasons for their choice, and which political party they hoped would win control of Congress. Views were also sought on the war in Iraq, and whether the Bush administration intentionally misled the American public in making its case for war with Iraq. A series of questions asked respondents whether the country, their state, and their local community were headed in the right direction, how satisfied they were with their life, and whether they felt optimistic about the future. Those polled also gave their impressions of Senator Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, and Senator John McCain, as well as the likelihood that they would vote for Hillary Clinton and John McCain if they ran for president in 2008. Additional questions addressed Hillary Clinton's views on issues, whether she possessed qualities such as leadership and trustworthiness, and whether Bill Clinton had too much political influence over her. Other topics addressed illegal immigration, Bush administration policies, the recent increase in gasoline prices, and the secret collection of domestic telephone records by the National Security Agency. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status, religious preference, and whether respondents considered themselves born-again or evangelical Christians."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush
