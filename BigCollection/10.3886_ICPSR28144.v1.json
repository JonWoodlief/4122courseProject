If APS Clients were assessed as lacking decision-making capacity, a qualified surrogate was identified to consent for them. Consenting older adults were examined by a Research Nurse (RN) to document location and size of bruises and assess whether they were inflicted during physical abuse. Study sites included the participant's home, a neutral site where the participant felt safe (such as a relative's house), or an inpatient setting.  In total, 67 abused elders participated in the study.</p>\n\n<p>The same RN conducted a series of study assessments on the 67 study participants. Participants removed their clothing and had all of their skin examined to document any bruising. Location, width and length (using a clear pliable circular measurement tool), and colors present were recorded along with the participant's or surrogate's recollection of the cause of the bruise and the time elapsed since the alleged abuse incident.  RNs also administered several tests to compile data on the client's functional status, medical conditions, cognitive status, history of falls, and an inventory of the alleged physical abuse. Functional status was measured by responses to an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale and to an Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale. Functional mobility was also measured through a gait and balance survey test of participants.  Participants answered questions about their medical conditions and use of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications and use of assistive devices.  Cognitive status was measured through a Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE). Participants or surrogates were asked to report falls over the last week, month, six months and year. The 12-item CTS2 physical assault scale indicated whether specific tactics (e.g., slapping, choking) were used against the respondent, as well as the frequency of the events over the\nprior year. The EAI was used to rate 12 possible abuse indicators, including other types of injuries.
