This survey, fielded April 23, 2000, is a call-back of the April 15-17, 2000, cohort (CBS NEWS MONTHLY POLL, APRIL 2000 [ICPSR 2982]), and was conducted to assess respondent views following action taken by federal marshalls from the I\nmmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to forcibly remove Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives' home and return him to the custody of his father. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the INS action, whether excessive force had been used by the federal marshalls, and whether the raid was necessary to enforce the law. Opinions were also solicited as to the best final solution to the Elian Gonzalez case. Respondents were asked to assess the roles and motivations of many of the principal players in the controversy, including the Miami relatives, Elian's father, the Cuban-American community, Attorney General Janet Reno and the United States Justice Department, Fidel Castro and the Cuban government, and the media. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, veteran status, voter registration and participation history, political party, political orientation, Hispanic descent, marital status, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
