It is part of a  continuing series of monthly surveys that solicit public opinion on  the presidency and on a range of political and social issues. Views  were sought on President Bill Clinton and his handling of the  presidency and whether the country was going in the right or wrong  direction. Prior to the 2000 presidential election, respondents were  asked how much attention they paid to it, the likelihood that they  would vote, whether their mind was made up, whom they would vote for  (Democrat Al Gore, Republican George W. Bush, Reform Party candidate  Pat Buchanan, or Green Party candidate Ralph Nader), who they expected  to win, and whether it made a difference who was elected president.  Opinions were solicited on George W. Bush and Al Gore, and the  likelihood that each candidate would maintain a strong national  economy, improve education, correctly handle an international crisis,  preserve Social Security, and appoint pro-choice Supreme Court  Justices. Questions were posed regarding how much respondents had  heard or read about George W. Bush's 1976 drunk driving arrest,  whether it would make a difference in their vote, and whether Bush  should have made this information public earlier in his campaign.  Following election day, respondents were polled on whether they had  voted, which presidential candidate they had voted for, how closely  they followed the election results, if the closeness of the election  made them regret not voting or wish they had voted for another  candidate, and the seriousness of the mistakes made by network  television in reporting the election results. Several questions  addressed whether the Electoral College should be kept or eliminated,  whether the winner of the electoral vote or the popular vote had a  more legitimate claim to the presidency, and whether a candidate who  won the Electoral College vote but not the popular vote could  effectively lead the country. Opinions were solicited on how George  W. Bush and Al Gore were handling the uncertain outcome of the  presidential election, whether either candidate was placing politics  above the good of the country, whether Palm Beach County, Florida,  should have a re-vote, how confident respondents were that their own  votes were counted properly, and whether the country's uncertainty  over its next president was a serious problem. Background variables  include sex, age, ethnicity, length of residency, income, marital  status, religion, education, labor union membership, number of  telephone lines, whether they were children in the household,  political orientation, political party affiliation, and voter registration and participation
