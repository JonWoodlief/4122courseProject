Besides the standard questions on  President Bill Clinton's performance, a series of questions\nwas  included focusing on the theme of taking responsibility, both in terms  of people in the United States government and the general population.  Respondents were asked if they thought that most people in government  positions were willing to take responsibility when things go wrong  and, if they say they are taking responsibility, whether they say so  to avoid fixing the problem. Additional questions asked whether people  today were willing to take responsibility when they had done something  wrong, whether it's wrong to make excuses to get out of personal and  civic responsibilities, whether the respondent had ever invented  excuses to avoid responsibility, and what the best excuse was that  they had ever given. Respondents' opinions on crime, criminal trials,  and criminal defenses were addressed in detail, and opinions on  specific cases, including the Lorena Bobbitt and Eric and Lyle  Menendez criminal trials, were solicited. Background information on  respondents includes voter registration status, household composition,  vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, political party,  political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
