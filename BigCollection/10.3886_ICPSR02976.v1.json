This is an  important concern because the consequences of police work stress can  adversely impact the delivery of effective law enforcement, as well as  pose a threat to the safety of police officers, their coworkers, their  family and friends, and the general public. In particular, interest  has focused on the effect of officers' stress on their spouses (or  partners) and families, especially in terms of domestic violence. In  response, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994  was promulgated, in part, to promote research on police work stress  and to identify and evaluate model stress prevention programs. In  further recognition of this problem, many police departments have  developed stress-reduction programs. However, most of the programs  have been individual-based and reactive rather than organizational and  preventive in nature. Recognizing the need for a psychometrically  validated and up-to-date police stress assessment tool, and the lack  of information on domestic violence in police families and whether it  is related to police stress, the researchers designed this study to  address these deficiencies in the existing literature on police stress  and especially on police stress-related domestic violence. The study  sought to answer the following questions: (1) What is the relationship  between police stress and domestic violence in police families? (2)  What is the extent of domestic violence in police families? (3) What  are the current stressors that contribute to police stress? (4) What  are some of the tools available to measure or evaluate domestic  violence in police families?

To  address deficiencies in the existing literature on police stress, the  investigators developed a police stress questionnaire, which included  a new police stress scale to capture perceived \"felt\" stress, and  administered it to a large sample of Baltimore City Police Department  sworn law enforcement employees. A five-page questionnaire was  developed to address four major constructs: (1) stressors, (2)  perceived current stress, (3) coping, and (4) health outcomes. The  questionnaires were aimed a\nt a 10th-grade reading level and took about  20 minutes to complete. Questionnaires were distributed to  approximately 1,100 police officers who volunteered to participate in  the survey from a total of more than 2,500 full-time sworn officers  who were in attendance during the morning and/or evening roll calls at  each of the nine Baltimore precincts.
