The program obtained both self-report and urinalysis data from arrestees. In 1997, the program was redesigned and retitled Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM). In 2000, ADAM introduced significant changes to the survey instrument, sampling procedures, and public-use data files. For this study, the researchers utilized data on a total of 5,210 Manhattan (New York City) arrestees surveyed by the ADAM program from 1998 to 2002.</p>\n\n<p>The principal investigators developed a formula for an episodic estimator of a respondent’s drug expense for cash, noncash, and cash-combination transactions.  The ADAM questionnaire asked each respondent whether he/she had in the past 30 days obtained any marijuana, crack/rock cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. For each drug the respondent obtained, the survey then asked if he/she had ever paid cash and whether he/she had obtained drugs without paying cash.  The value of a transaction was based on either the price paid or the amount of a drug obtained, depending on the nature of the transaction. For cash-only transactions, the value was set at the price paid. The researchers used a two-step procedure for estimating the value of noncash transactions. First, they examined the types of units involved in transactions for each drug.  For each type of unit, the research team examined the distribution of prices per u\nnit paid in cash-only purchases as well as the median and the mode. They then set a typical price-per-unit for each drug and each type of unit. Second, the principal investigators estimated the value of noncash transactions as the number of units obtained multiplied by the typical price per unit. For cash-combination transactions, the researchers calculated the value of the transaction based on the quantity of drugs obtained using the procedure for noncash transactions.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The dataset contains a total of 267 variables relating to Manhattan arrestees' demographics, interview information, criminal history, urinalysis test results, drug use, drug market transactions, and drug expenses.
