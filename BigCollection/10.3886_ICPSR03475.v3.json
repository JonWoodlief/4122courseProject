Respondents were asked  why people were socially excluded, what the role of government should  be in reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion, how satisfied  they were with their lives, whether there were people in their  neighborhoods who lived in poverty, and what it meant to live properly.  They were also asked whether they had financial problems, and if so,  for how long and what had caused them. A number of questions focused on  problems related to work. Respondents were asked whether they had been  unemployed in the last five years and if so for how long. Those  employed or self-employed were asked questions concerning job  satisfaction, the type of organization for which they worked, the  number of hours worked, their job title, number of people employed at  their workplace, how long they had been continuously employed, and what  they took into consideration when choosing a job. They were also asked  whether their job was interesting and secure, whether they had to work  hard and under pressure, whether their employers paid for training or  education, whether they had friends at work, and whether they had  influ\nence over the decision-making processes at their workplace and in  deciding how to do their tasks. They also compared different aspects of  their current job with what they had been doing five years ago,  described relations between management and employees, and commented on  how their work affected their health and their lives after work.  Another major focus of the surveys was the pension system. Those who  had already retired were asked at what age they had retired, what the  main source of their retirement income was, whether their current  financial situation was better than before retirement and what it would  look like in five to ten years, and whether the state pension allowed  them to get by easily. Non-pensioners supplied information about when  they intended to retire, what their main source of income would be  after retirement, what percentage of their current household's total  income after tax they considered sufficient in retirement, and how they  were saving for their retirement. Additionally, respondents were asked  what a good pension system should look like, how the pension should be  provided, what level of minimum guaranteed income should be provided  for elderly people, whether older workers should be forced to retire at  a fixed age, whether men and women should be treated equally in terms  of the retirement system, and how retirement problems caused by an  aging society should be resolved. Demographic and other background  information collected includes respondent's age, gender, nationality,  marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age at  completion of education, trade union membership, household income, type and size of locality, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European
