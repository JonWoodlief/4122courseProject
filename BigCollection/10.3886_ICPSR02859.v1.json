Client intervention programs in four cities provided opportunities for gathering information from men arrested for trying to hire street prostitutes. For the study, a detailed anonymous questionnaire was administered to men before the beginning of every client intervention workshop in San Francisco, California, and Portland, Oregon. The questionnaire was also administered at a small program in Santa Clara, California, which was modeled after the San Francisco program. During the course of the study, the Portland program ceased operations and a new program began in Las Vegas, which became a significant source of data. Men were asked about their sexual behavior, including the number and type of partners, frequency of sex, interest in pornography, age and circumstances of first sexual encounter with a prostitute, sexual acts performed with prostitutes, and condom use with prostitutes. Clients were also asked about their attitudes toward premarital sex, homosexual sex, extramarital sex, and sex between adults and children. Other questions probed men's views about prostitutes, the legality of prostitution, and violence against women. Background information gathered on clients included race, educational level, sexual orientation, marital status, work status, socioeconomic status, age, parents' marital status, history of sexual or physical abuse, military service, relationship history, and sexual preferences."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In the late 1990s, prostitution had become an  issue of increasing concern to law enforcement officials, women's  organizations, and community members. The presence of prostitution  negatively affected the livability of neighborhoods, potentially  harmed local businesses, and was associated with illicit drug use and  other vice. Prostitutes were at high risk of contracting human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases  (STDs), and prostitution had the potential to become a vector for the  transmission of STDs to clients and their spouses or partners. Perhaps  most significantly, prostitutes themselves were frequent victims of  violent crimes. Research and policy had focused attention primarily on  prostitutes rather than on their clients. In 1995, two creative  programs, Portland's Sexual Exploitation Education Project (SEEP) and  San Francisco's First Offender Prostitution Program (FOPP), began to  address the issue of prostitution differently, focusing prevention  efforts on the demand side of the supply/demand equation, the clients  of prostitutes. The overwhelming majority of men in these cities who  were arrested for paying or attempting to pay for sex participated in  the intervention programs. Some were required to attend the program as  part of their sentence, while others received reduced fines or had the  arrest purged from their records in exchange for their  attendance. Using data gathered from men attending such programs, this  study sought to provide information about this otherwise inaccessible  population. In particular, this project sought to collect information  about the background characteristics, attitudes, and reported  behaviors of arrested clients, with particular attention to the issue  of violent crime against women. T\nhe project was designed to answer the  following questions: (1) What are the background characteristics of  men who solicit prostitution? How do they differ from a representative  sample of men? (2) What types of sex-related behaviors characterize  men who solicit prostitution? (3) Why do men visit prostitutes? How  consistent are their motivations with scholarly and popular  understandings of the prostitution client?  (4) What are the attitudes  of prostitution clients toward violence against women?  (5) What are  the consequences of conceiving of sexuality as a commodity? (6) What  are rates of recidivism for participants in prostitution client intervention programs?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Client intervention programs provided an  unprecedented opportunity to gather information from the previously  inaccessible population of men arrested for trying to hire street  prostitutes.
