Of the 18,364 subjects, 13,902 were Institutional Division  (TDCJ-ID) inmates and 4,462 were State Jail Division (TDCJ-SJD)  inmates. Two meetings were held with staff at the Texas Department of  Criminal Justice -- Program and Services Division (TDCJ-PSD),\nand  administration of the drug screen was observed. Although designed to  be administered in a group or individual setting, the TCU Drug Screen  was administered by TDCJ staff almost exclusively in a small group  setting (12-25 inmates per group) as part of a larger battery of  assessments during the intake process at a TDCJ facility. A staff  person handed out the instrument and explained that TDCJ provided  treatment services to inmates who had a demonstrated need and that  responses to the instrument could have an impact on whether or not  they received treatment services while incarcerated. Inmates were  reminded that untruthful responses (particularly if inconsistent with  other information in their file such as admissions of drug use during  a presentence investigation) might not be viewed favorably during the  prerelease supervision review process. The TCU Drug Screen  instructions and items were then read aloud, with inmates being asked  to follow along and to respond only after an item was read. For those  who did not speak English, a bilingual staff person or inmate assisted  in the administration of the form. Once completed, the screens were  optically scanned and scored and a computer-generated report with the  TCU Drug Screen was printed. The level and intensity of treatment  services needed was then determined and a referral decision was  made. A review of existing records also was conducted to determine if  there was any evidence of drug-related problems. As part of this  study, the relationship between TCU Drug Screen information and  post-release reincarceration was examined. Of the 18,364 subjects, a  subset of inmates had been released from TDCJ at least one year prior  to the collection of reincarceration data, thus eligible to be  included in analyses of one-year post-release reincarceration  data. The remaining subjects had either not been released or were  released within the year and were therefore excluded from follow-up  analyses. Although one original goal in the study was to assess the  comparability, or concurrent validity, of the TCU Drug Screen with the  lengthier, more comprehensive Addiction Severity Index (ASI), TDCJ  changed the administration protocol for the ASI so that it was given  only to a subsample of 3,245 inmates who failed to disclose drug use  problems on the TCU Drug Screen. Furthermore, prior to ASI  administration, an interviewer explained to the inmates that this was  their second chance to report any drug-related problems, confronted  them with any corroborating evidence of drug use from their files, and  then informed them that parole review boards do not look favorably upon inmates who are suspected of being dishonest."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data include inmate responses to all items of  the TCU Drug Screen as well as the overall drug screen score.
