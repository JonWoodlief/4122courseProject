Questions were posed regarding respondents' vote intentions for the 1992 presidential election, their opinions of the 1992 presidential candidates and running mates, Hillary Clinton, and Barbara Bush, and the likelihood of their voting in the 1992 presidential election. Those surveyed were queried regarding the ability of George Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ross Perot to end the recession, whether the candidates said what they really believed, the ability of the candidates to deal with problems, and the candidate most likely to raise taxes. Additional questions dealt with the national economy, unemployment, abortion, family leave, the federal budget\ndeficit, foreign economic competition, the Iran-Contra situation, Clinton's draft status, and viewing professional football on television. A series of post-presidential debate call-back questions was also asked. In addition, respondents were asked to give their approval rating of Bush with respect to his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the situation in Iraq, and the economy. Background information on respondents includes sex, age, race, marital status, education, religious preference, political orientation, party preference, voter registration status, and vote choices in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
