The criminal appeals process is a vital feature of the legal  system because it challenges lower court convictions, thereby further  ensuring due process. Recently the volume of appeals has been  increasing at a much higher rate than crime, arrests, and  prosecutions. Criminal appellate courts have been forced to modify  their procedures in response to increasing caseloads. Since very  little was known about these modified procedures, this study was  conducted to examine three alternatives that have become settled  policy in the courts that employ them. The purpose of the study was to  clarify problems with such procedures and to gauge the prospects for  further successful appellate reform. A procedure called \"case  management,\" used in the Illinois Appellate Court, Fourth District,  in Springfield was chosen as a subject for this study. With this  process, every appeal was given an achievable time frame. Deadlines  were made clear in a scheduling order which was strictly  enforced. Also selected was the California Court of Appeals, Third  District, in Sacramento for its procedure of \"staff screening for  submission without oral argument.\" This process was meant to reduce  the amount of time spent on nonargued appeals. Time prior to briefing  was not affected. Each case was reviewed by a three-judge panel which  recommended a waiver of argument if it felt argument was not  necessary. If argument was waived, the appeal was simply submitted to  the same panel for decision. All other cases were tried on a regular  argument calendar. The Rhode Island Supreme Court was selected because  it employed \"fast-tracking procedures,\" which focused on cases that  did not require full briefing. Cases that did not require full  briefing were identified by individual justices. After counsel was  consulted, these cases were put on a \"show-cause\" calendar. These  cases were submitted for decision with limited written statements and  argument on a motions calendar. The other cases proceeded with  briefing and argument in a normal fashion. Participants from each  court were interviewed, and case data were collected from their court records."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Interviews were conducted with judges, attorneys,  court clerks, and other court staff from the California Court of  Appeals, Third District, in Sacramento, the Illinois Appellate Court,  Third District, in Springfield, and the Rhode Island Supreme  Court.
