It is extremely demanding on applicant countries,\r\ntime consuming and essentially power- rather than rule-based. This article argues\r\nthat existing WTO members select themselves into the Working Party of applicant\r\ncountries, the body which determines the timing and conditions of accession, in\r\norder to have the option to strategically delay membership by the applicant and/or\r\nextract concessions from it. Existing members will select themselves into a specific\r\nWorking Party if their own trade interests are strongly affected, which will be the\r\ncase if the existing member’s bilateral trade with the applicant country forms a\r\nlarge share of its income, unless both countries already have a preferential trade\r\nagreement (PTA) between them. Trade interests are also strongly affected if the\r\nexisting member competes with the applicant in terms of export product and\r\nmarket structure. Conversely, where both member and applicant have more PTAs\r\nwith third countries of large economic size in common, potential accession will\r\naffect the member’s trade interests less. An empirical analysis of Working Party\r\nmembership since 1968 estimates to what extent these three different facets of\r\ntrade interests are substantively important determinants of Working Party\r\ncomposition."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-04-18"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for WTR.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":125627,"dataFile":{"id":3013155,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OFF1TO/PJHZTE","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OFF1TO/PJHZTE","filename":"Article for WTR.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":4920,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15b82497ca9-97db36e80d0a","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"587a1973302ea45b959f98906861dc02","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"587a1973302ea45b959f98906861dc02"}}},{"label":"Article for WTR.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":125627,"dataFile":{"id":3013156,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OFF1TO/LRAHUL","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OFF1TO/LRAHUL","filename":"Article for WTR.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":1511904,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15b82497820-f31f3fb17004","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:WgydQejDfR5N7IlUW8p9Rg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"40bd85e393b321980c0de09ab4ef517c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"40bd85e393b321980c0de09ab4ef517c"}}}]}}}
