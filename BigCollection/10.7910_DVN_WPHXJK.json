At the first stage, 35 of 67 blocks (the initial project area) were randomly selected with the use of random numbers generated using MS-Excel. Of the 35 selected blocks, in 27 blocks, Parivartan program was implemented. In the remaining eight blocks, the government worked with SHGs on small savings and credit, and those groups were selected as controls. In the second stage, the SHGs were systematically selected within each selected block. The SHG lists that were available with the program were used as a sampling frame for the selection of SHGs. The first SHG was selected using a random number followed by every nth SHG chosen from the list. By the 12th-month of follow-up, the Parivartan program in one of the districts was discontinued, resulting in 7 districts with 24 blocks."}]}},"files":[{"label":"Parivartan_panel_group_individual_BL_ML.DTA","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":137199,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":3157016,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/ARQWCT","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/ARQWCT","filename":"Parivartan_panel_group_individual_BL_ML.DTA","contentType":"application/x-stata","filesize":5374391,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:163984ad2d5-9c38ec54ce98","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"58dcd974d0f6dcc0a25f8bfb067b16f8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"58dcd974d0f6dcc0a25f8bfb067b16f8"}}},{"label":"Questionnaire-Women_midline.doc","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":137199,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":3157019,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/T6CNKY","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/T6CNKY","filename":"Questionnaire-Women_midline.doc","contentType":"application/msword","filesize":1027072,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1639852bf6e-3ce229945d14","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"450c0bceabf0a05dca11059b613decfc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"450c0bceabf0a05dca11059b613decfc"}}},{"label":"Readme_parivartan project.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":137199,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":3157018,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/RVUVN8","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/RVUVN8","filename":"Readme_parivartan project.txt","contentType":"text/plain","filesize":4928,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16398503a1f-acc2922ded2e","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"dc8d76900b8514014c6bbc893c0217d0","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"dc8d76900b8514014c6bbc893c0217d0"}}},{"label":"Women baseline questionnaire_Parivartan.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":137199,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":3157015,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/URNVUF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WPHXJK/URNVUF","filename":"Women baseline questionnaire_Parivartan.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":374395,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16398406eb8-1ff538d1ed9f","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4a9eabb966ae675bcc5ff238dbe30243","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4a9eabb966ae675bcc5ff238dbe30243"}}}]}}}
