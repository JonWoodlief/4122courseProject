These cases were then weighted to represent the 11,908 general civil trials concluded in the nation's 75 most populous counties. Data from the 2001 Civil Trial Survey were used to produce several Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports describing the characteristics of civil litigation in state courts. The 2001 Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals tracks every general civil case concluded by bench or jury trial in 2001 in the 46 surveyed counties that were subsequently appealed to an intermediate appellate court or court of last resort. In the 2001 Civil Justice Survey of State Courts information was collected for every general civil trial concluded in 43 of the 46 selected counties. In these counties, the 2001 Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals collected information on all general trials that produced an appeal. In the three remaining counties, (Cook County, Philadelphia County, and Bergen County), the appeals survey obtained information for both those general civil trials concluded in 2001 that were subsequently appealed and, in addition, collected information for those general civil appeals that were not captured at the trial court level. The 2001 Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals tracks data on general civil appeals that originated from 46 of the nation's 75 most populous counties. Unlike the 2001 Civil Justice Survey of State Courts, cases were not weighted to represent appeals in the nation's 75 most populous counties. The appeals were followed until they were withdrawn, dismissed, or decided on the merits in the appellate courts. All appeals were tracked until April 30, 2005. Appeals not disposed on that date are identified as pending. Overall four appellate datasets were produced from this survey."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"case processing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil courts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil law"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"court cases"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"court system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disposition (legal)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"lawsuits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state courts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
