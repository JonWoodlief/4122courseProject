Based on survey responses of more than 850 federal legislators from 1990 to 2005, we generate party placements on an ideological scale where 1 equals left and 10 equals right. The data are rescaled to account for idiosyncracies in responses as well as variation in use of the survey scale across time. We discuss both the validity and reliability of our new measures by comparing them to other datasets. We further discuss three substantive issues revealed by these data. First, ideological polarization has moderated over time. Second, the median legislator has shifted noticeably to the left, and now stands equidistant from the influential PT and PSDB, the parties that have anchored recent presidential elections. Third, Brazilian political elites continue to shun self-identifications associated with political conservatism or with neoliberalism."}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-06-06"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1989"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1989"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Slightly modified estimates, extended through the sixth wave of the BLS, are now available\n<a href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/18330\">here</a>.","Complete survey materials of the all waves of the Brazilian Legislative Study are available\n<a href=\"http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/bls\">here</a>"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Brazil"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["National Legislators"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"A pdf file containing a quick description of the data files in this project.","label":"dataguide.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":52894,"categories":["Data guide"],"dataFile":{"id":1412582,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"dataguide.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":40384,"description":"A pdf file containing a quick description of the data files in this project.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:39097","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3e4f2a3879c5a359c60e374a6e2cb49d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3e4f2a3879c5a359c60e374a6e2cb49d"}}},{"description":"This data-set(s) contain the original data as collected by Tim Power in five legislator surveys taken in 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2005, as well as the rescaled position of legislators.
