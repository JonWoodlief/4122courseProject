The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Que\nstions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including psychotherapeutics. Respondents were also asked about problems resulting from their use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, their perceptions of the risks involved, and personal and family income sources and amounts. Half of the respondents were asked questions regarding substance use by close friends. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density. Youth respondents were also asked about time spent on homework and leisure activities."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol

The data and codebook were prepared for release by Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, and the codebook was initially distributed by National Opinion Research Center, Chicago, IL, under contracts with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For selected variables, statistical imputation was done following logical imputation to replace missing responses. These variables are identified by the designation \"IMPUTATION-REVISED\" in the variable label, and the names of these variables begin with the letters \"IR\". For each imputation-revised variable there is a corresponding imputation indicator variable that indicates whether a case's value on the variable resulted from an interview response, logical imputation, or statistical imputation. The names of imputation indicator variables begin with the letters \"II\".;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Data were weighted based on two weight factors required in the sampling plan. The product of the sampling weight factors is equal to the inverse of each respondent's selection probability. Adjustments were made to compensate for nonres\nponse and sampling error. Adjustments also included a poststratification to Census population estimates.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: To protect the confidentiality of respondents, all variables that could be used to identify individuals have been encrypted or collapsed in the public use file. These modifications should not affect analytic uses of the public use file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Some frequencies related to interview information detailed on page 79 of the codebook (FINLRES1, VSADLTCM, PHADLTCM, VSYTHCM, PHYTHCM) reflect overlapping records. For example, although \"Adult/Youth\" (ADULTYTH) indicates that 4,043 adults were interviewed, \"Final Adult Result\" (FINLRES1) indicates that an adult interview was completed in 4,706 cases. Crosstabulation of these variables revealed that adult interviews were completed in 663 youth cases. This apparently represents households in which both an adult and a youth were interviewed.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For some drugs that have multiple names, questions regarding the use of that drug may be asked for each distinct name. For example, the use of methedrine and desoxyn are measured separately in this study even though they are both methamphetamine.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1997-05-16"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1982"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1982"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) Series"}}}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["individual"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["The civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the coterminous United States (Alaska and Hawaii excluded) aged 12 and older."]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Multistage area probability sample design involving five selection stages: (a) primary areas (e.g., counties), (b) subareas within primary areas (geographic area of approximately 2,500 population in 1970), (c) housing units within subareas, (d) age group domains within listed units, and (e) members of households within sampled age groups.
