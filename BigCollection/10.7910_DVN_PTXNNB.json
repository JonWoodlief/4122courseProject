In bottom-up LC-MS/MS-based proteomics, proteins are enzymatically digested into peptides prior to query by LC-MS/MS.  Thus, the information directly available from the LC-MS/MS data is at the peptide level.  If a protein-level analysis is desired, the peptide-level information must be tolled up into protein-level information.  We propose a principal components analysis-based statistical method, ProPCA, for efficiently estimating relative protein abundance from bottom-up label-free LC-MS/MS data, which incorporates both spectral count information and LC-MS peptide ion peak attributes, such as peak area, volume or height.  ProPCA may be used effectively with a variety of quantification platforms and is easily implemented.  We show that ProPCA outperforms existing quantitative methods for peptide-protein roll up, including special counting methods and other methods for combining LC-MS peptide peak attributes.  The performance of ProPCA is validated using a dataset derived from the LC-MS/MS analysis of a mixture of protein standards (the UPS2 proteomic dynamic range standard introduced by the ABRF Proteomics Standards Research Group, 2006).  Finally, we apply ProPCA to a comparative LC-MS/MS analysis of digested total cell lysates prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis by alternative lysis methods and show that ProPCA identifies more differently abundant proteins than competing methods."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Statistical Genetics, Genomics, and Omics"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-09-07"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-11-18"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"mcp.M110.002774-1.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54347,"dataFile":{"id":1820491,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"mcp.M110.002774-1.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1264306,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:62151","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"064174e488c263f4aab14c628063e116","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"064174e488c263f4aab14c628063e116"}}},{"description":"","label":"mcp.M110.002774.full.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54347,"dataFile":{"id":1820490,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"mcp.M110.002774.full.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":525527,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:62150","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9f165a35b1b47d5f20d34b49fdd2b107","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9f165a35b1b47d5f20d34b49fdd2b107"}}}]}}}
