This article examines two popular yet highly controversial claims\r\nabout the conditions most favorable to the rapid spread of new technology. The first states that latecomer\r\nadvantage allows developing countries to diffuse new technology faster than developed countries. The second\r\nclaim, widely articulated by advocates of neoliberal policy reform, is that new technologies diffuse more rapidly\r\nwhere countries are ‘‘open’’ to international trade and investment. To investigate these claims we use eventhistory\r\nanalysis to estimate the determinants of diffusion speed across a large panel of developed and developing\r\ncountries for three very different technologies. These are: continuous steel casting, shuttleless textile weaving\r\nlooms, and digital telephone mainlines. Our results broadly support both propositions. Countries that adopt new\r\ntechnology later or have a smaller existing capital stock—characteristic features of developing countries—diffuse\r\nnew technology more rapidly than countries that adopt earlier or have more installed capacity—two characteristics\r\nof developed countries. Trade openness is also found to influence the rate of diffusion positively for all\r\nthree technologies. Yet, consistent with recent empirical studies, we fail to find support for the idea that foreign\r\ndirect investment (FDI) accelerates the diffusion of new technology in host economies. The article concludes by\r\ndiscussing the geographical implications of our findings. Key Words: diffusion, globalization, industrialization,\r\nlatecomer, technology."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-02"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Do-file","label":"Article for AAAG (technology diffusion).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79102,"dataFile":{"id":2769563,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/HE0VDJ/TB1JXP","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HE0VDJ/TB1JXP","filename":"Article for AAAG (technology diffusion).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":4946,"description":"Do-file","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15202ac1fca-967523af1db6","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d8c43056c0b70bac1d3f7d0067326854","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d8c43056c0b70bac1d3f7d0067326854"}}},{"description":"Data","label":"Article for AAAG (technology diffusion).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79102,"dataFile":{"id":2769564,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/HE0VDJ/J62BPJ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HE0VDJ/J62BPJ","filename":"Article for AAAG (technology diffusion).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":1348700,"description":"Data","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15202acb824-4f3b516f7697","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:xFSJtajCf5CAUUnv13CWYQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"91d484eae915216c0dcaf422f5ceb8c3","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"91d484eae915216c0dcaf422f5ceb8c3"}}}]}}}
