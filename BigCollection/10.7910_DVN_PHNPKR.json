However, just because one terror incident follows\r\nanother does not necessarily imply that one is caused by the other or, in other\r\nwords, that terror attacks are what is called spatially dependent. Rather, both\r\nincidents could have been triggered by the same underlying cause. This is known\r\nas Galton’s problem. One area where this problem is particularly prevalent is\r\ninternational terrorism. According to Huntington, international terrorism is\r\ncontagious because of civilizational rallying effects. If radical groups from one\r\ncountry attack targets from a country of another civilization, then groups from\r\nother countries of the same civilization as the initial terrorist groups will become\r\nmore likely to also attack this target. Any test of this hypothesis has to solve\r\nGalton’s problem and thus to disentangle spatial dependence from spatial clustering\r\nof attacks and common shocks and trends, which affect similar groups from\r\ndifferent countries similarly. Accounting for such potentially confounding effects, we\r\nnevertheless find evidence for spatial dependence in international terrorism along\r\ncivilizational lines in the post-Cold War period and particularly so for specific intercivilizational\r\ncombinations. However, while contagion consistent with Huntington’s\r\npredictions exists, spatial dependence seems to have a substantively small effect on\r\npatterns of international terrorism."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-10"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for CMPS (terrorism).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79176,"dataFile":{"id":2772819,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/PHNPKR/Z8KBUZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PHNPKR/Z8KBUZ","filename":"Article for CMPS (terrorism).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":11474,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1522b95d6f5-c1a2633e2687","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"03a334925952aeebe67115c1c0585ab3","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"03a334925952aeebe67115c1c0585ab3"}}},{"label":"Article for CMPS (terrorism).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79176,"dataFile":{"id":2772818,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/PHNPKR/P0VMV8","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PHNPKR/P0VMV8","filename":"Article for CMPS (terrorism).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":166539430,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1522b991ac5-5c83ec413918","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:IH3Mg5vg5QYdUbvqVVYKCA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5a95a28bc4cdebe5fd464f21d73bada9","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5a95a28bc4cdebe5fd464f21d73bada9"}}}]}}}
