In this case, we also wanted to have more than two levels in most variables (e.g. play the same music in six different registers) in order to explore whether the factors contribute to emotions in a linear fashion. A full factorial would have been impossible since it would have require over 14000 combinations to be tested. Fractional Factorial Designs (FFD) and Response Surface Methodologies (RSM), collectively called optimal designs are fortunately available, although widespread usage of these within behavioural sciences is still rare despite serious attempts of advocating them (see McClelland, 1997; Collins, Dziak, &amp; Li, 2009). The main advantage of using optimal designs over full factorials design is that they allow to focus the research resources on particular questions, minimize redundancy (e.g., by eliminating high-order factor interactions), and to maximize the statistical power. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here the aim was to only focus on main effects and first-order interactions and to explore whether the levels of these factors operate in linear or cubic fashion, both of which allow to fully capitalize on the benefits offered by the optimal design paradigms. It is worth pointing out that the main effects of the factors are little affected by the optimal design. We constructed the design matrix in a way that kept the number of cases for factor levels approximately equal regarding the main effects and first-order interactions in order to present balanced array of factor combinations to the listeners and be compatible with the traditional statistical analysis methods. A summary of the cases for each factor levels is displayed below. Similarly, the cells of the first order factor interactions are near to the equal distribution. An optimal design may offer advances in scientific knowledge by sacrificing such aspects of the design that are of little interest in this stage of research. In the field of emotions and the contributing features, few complete factorial studies with 2-3 factors have already been completed (e.g., Ilie &amp; Thompson, 2006) and therefore an overview of a large number of factors and their main effects is clearly motivated and only achievable by using optimal design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Manipulations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The design matrix is available as <code>design_matrix.csv</code> file where the nro indicates the stimulus number and the other columns refer to factors and their levels, explained below.
