Views were solicited regarding the appropriateness of religious   leaders taking public positions and/or supporting political   candidates based on the candidates' stands on topics such as   abortion, gun control, nuclear weapons, cultural exhibits, and the   poor. Respondents were also asked about their opinions regarding Pope   John Paul II, John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archdiocese of New York,   and their local parish and parish priest. Opinions were also sought   on Church issues such as the ordination of women and homosexuals,   allowing girls to assist at the altar, and allowing priests t\no marry,   as well as public policy issues including abortion and public funding   of private/parochial schools. Self-identified Catholics were asked   about their level of involvement with the Church and church-related   organizations.
