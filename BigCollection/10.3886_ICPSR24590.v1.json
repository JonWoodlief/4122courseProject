Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling his job as president, whether they approved of the way he was handling the situation in Iraq, and whether they approved of his handling of the United States campaign against terrorism. Respondent's opinions were solicited on whether they trusted the Democrats or the Republicans to do a better job in handling the war in Iraq and the campaign against terrorism. Respondents were asked for their opinions on multiple issues associated with the war in Iraq such as whether the war was worth fighting, whether respondents thought the United States would win or lose the war, how confident respondents were in the Iraqi government to fulfill their commitment to restore civil order in Iraq,  whether the war had contributed to the security of the United States, and whether the United States had made progress toward restoring civil order in Iraq. Questions about the United States military force focused on whether respondents thought the increase in United States forces improved the situation in Iraq and Iraq’s security situation within a few months, whether military forces should be further increased or decreased in Iraq,  and whether withdrawing from Iraq would do more to increase the risk of a terrorist attack occurring in the United States. Additional questions addressed whether respondents were satisfied with the choice of candidates for the 2008 presidential election and for whom they were going to vote, General David Petraeus’ progress report on the war in Iraq, respondent's confidence in the ability of the government to prevent further terrorist attacks against Americans, whether the war on terrorism could be a success without the United States winning the war, and whether the country was safer at the time of this poll versus September 11, 2001.
