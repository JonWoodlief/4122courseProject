Based on the different loyalties and roles of political advisors (PA) and civil servants (CS), we hypothesize that 1) PAs are more likely to voice internally, 2) CSs are more likely to voice externally, and 3) CSs in functionally politicized systems are more likely to stay silent. These hypotheses are tested on – and partially supported by – data collected through two surveys directed to the ministerial staffs in Denmark and Sweden. PAs are more likely to voice internally, but none of the two groups are particularly keen to voice externally. The propensity to voice concerns in case of perceived harmful policy proposals depend on the kind as well as the level of politicization."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-12-03"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ministerial advice, civil servants, political advisers, politicization, bureaucratic responses"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Some of the background variables, age and seniority, are excluded for our sample as respondents were promised full anonymity and combining background characteristics would make it possible to identify respondents.
