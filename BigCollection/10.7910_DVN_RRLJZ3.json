As a result of intense harvesting pressure it ranks high on the IUCN' 1994 CITES list as endangered. Insufficient availability of seeds has limited the current efforts to propagate D. crassiflora from seedlings. Therefore, vegetative propagation through leafy stem cutting could be an alternative. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of four rooting media, length of cuttings and auxin (seradix-2) application on the rooting ability of stem cuttings set up in a non-mist propagator. The rooting process was monitored over 14 weeks. Root development started after 9 weeks. At 14 weeks, the Seradix-2 and rooting medium significantly improved the rooting ability. Decomposed sawdust was the best substrate. The combination of the three factors didnâ€™t significantly influence rooting of cuttings. Stem cuttings of 5 cm length survive better in non-mist propagator. The results of the study suggest that D. crassiflora is amenable to vegetative propagation by leafy stem cutting."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Auxins"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cuttings"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Propagation by cuttings"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rooting medium"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Diospyros crassiflora"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Tsobeng, A.; Tchoundjeu, Z.; Kouodiekong, L.; Asaah, E. 2011.
