For the first major focus, the survey asked respondents to provide their opinions on lifelong learning including identifying life changes that have occurred in the last two years, the best opportunities in which to learn in a private or public setting, contexts in the past 12 months in which something was learned, and the most significant opportunity for learning in the last 5 years. Respondents were asked whether they studied or trained in the past 12 months, whether they were advised or required to do so, and the reasons why. In addition, they were queried about the three main benefits of the study or training they undertook in the past 12 months, the main reasons to complete study or training in the future, and their preferred method to improve or update professional skills. The survey also examined respondent opinion of obstacles that would affect and factors that would encourage participation in study or training, the most useful sources of information that would assist in improving study or career prospects, and situations that would influence them to pay for the cost of a course. Respondents also evaluated whether certain skills were useful, and if they had evidence of possessing these skills. For the second major focus, consumer rights, the survey only queried respondents in Poland. They were asked about their confidence in fair treatment during daily shopping -- while making major purchases -- and in purchasing a product in a shop, and whether they had problems when buying specific items from shops, sellers, or service providers, and the actions they took in response. Respondents were also asked about their knowledge of consumer rights and consumer rights groups, which people or organizations they would trust to provide correct advice and information about consumer rights, and whether they had asked Federacja Kosumentow, a consumer rights group, for information or advice. In addition, respondents evaluated the service they received from Federacja Kosumentow and whether they would refer others to this organization. They also identified whether they would monetarily support an independent consumer association, how frequently the media talked about consumer rights, and who in the media was the source of this information. Finally, respondents were asked whether they had heard a particular message and to define the meaning of that message, to evaluate Poland's consumer rights in comparison to those of other EU countries, and to assess the efficiency of the justice system in punishing people who cheat consumers. Demographic and other background information collected from all respondents includes age, gender, nationality, origin of birth (pers\nonal and parental), marital status, left-right political self-placement, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, availability of a fixed or mobile telephone in the household, type and size of locality, region of residence, and language of interview (select countries)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer
