Written   court decisions related to AIDS in state and federal courts were   located via the LEXUS and WESTLAW data systems. For a case to be   eligible, it had to address an issue involving AIDS or involve a party   who was believed to be infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus   (HIV), and a legal decision had to provide sufficient written material   to analyze. Coding was completed by three individuals with legal   training based on a team-developed codebook. Except in those areas   where a preliminary test showed 90-percent reliability, variables were   coded based on a consensus rule. Variables include court jurisdiction,   whether the case was civil or criminal, case issue area, gender of   plaintiff, relationship between parties, demand and primary purpose of   the demand by the defendant and the plaintiff, what the court   explicitly relied upon for its decision, whether the plaintiff or   defendant had AIDS, AIDS-Related Complex (ARC), or was HIV-infected,   and whether the plaintiff or defendant was gay, an IV drug user, a   prisoner or an accused criminal, a member of a stigmatized group, or a   racial or an ethnic minority. The unit of analysis is the written court  decision."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AIDS"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"case processing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"court cases"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"courts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XII.
