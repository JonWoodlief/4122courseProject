The survey relied on the willingness of area residents to complete diary records of all travel for a 48-hour period. Household recruitment for the study was conducted\nthrough the use of a recruitment interview, in which respondents were informed of the survey, its purpose, and the obligation of all household members to complete the survey. The 8,069 participating households, when weighted, represent 21,323 persons, 14,449 vehicles, and 126,127 places visited during the 48-hour travel period. Data were collected on trip generation, trip distribution, modal choice, transit use, neighborhood preferences, and trip activities. Household data includes demographic information such as household size, household vehicles, dwelling type, home ownership status, tenure, and computer ownership.  Also included are summary statistics regarding the number of workers, students, and trips made during the 48-hour travel period. Person data includes demographic information about the household members, student data, employment data for first and second jobs, and health related information."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The objective of the household travel survey was to collect information on work and non-work travel behavior.

The survey employed a list assisted random digit dial design with a probability sample selection process that selected households for inclusion in the study. The major requirement for probability samples was that the relative probability (or chance) of any given household in the universe being included in the sample was known. Once the sampling procedure was determined, the selection of specific households for inclusion in the sample was left entirely to chance. The sample included both listed and unlisted households. The definition of a completed household was one in which travel and activity data were collected from all household members age five and older. A total of 8,069 households met this criterion. The type of probability sampling employed was stratified sampling in which the sample goal was to have 20 percent of the sample in each of the five preset NRDL categories. Current income data was unknown at the time of the study and the relationship between NRDL and household size was unknown, hence these two variables were not used to stratify the sample. Overall sample goals for the Atlanta Household Travel Survey include the following: (1) Inclusion of high density areas; (2) County level representation; (3) Low income representation; and (4) Minority representation."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Atlanta Household Travel Survey utilizes both weighting and expansion factors to (1) adjust the sample data to match population parameters, and (2) expand trip information to all households in the survey area.
