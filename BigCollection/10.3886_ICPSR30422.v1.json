It measured sup\nport and opposition to certain general goals of the overhaul, as well as support and opposition to specific parts of the legislation. It had a particular focus on what people knew about the bill and what misperceptions they may have about what was and wasn't in the legislation. In addition, the survey investigated beliefs about the consequences of the legislation on future taxes, health insurance costs, access to health care, and the quality of health care. Other topics investigated by the survey include health status, health insurance status, trust in the federal government, approval/disapproval of the Obama Administration's performance, political ideology, religion, religiosity, and sources of news.

Households are recruited into the panel by randomly selecting telephone numbers and residential addresses. With sampling conducted throughout the year, the panel includes about 50,000 adult members ages 18 and older. For all new panel members, demographic information is collected in an online \"profile\" survey. After the survey is completed, the panel member becomes active and is available to be sampled for other surveys, such as this survey on health care reform. For this survey, (ICPSR 30422), respondents were randomly selected from the adult active panel members.</p>\n\n<p>Knowledge Networks provides an internet appliance and internet service connection to KnowledgePanel recruits who do not already have internet access. People who already have computers and internet service are permitted to participate using their own equipment. Panelists receive unique log-in information for accessing surveys online, and then are sent emails three to four times a month inviting them to participate in research.</p>\n\n<p>More information about KnowledgePanel is available on the Knowledge Networks Web site\n<a href=\"http://www.knowledgenetworks.com\">http://www.knowledgenetworks.com</a>\n.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"web-based survey"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Associated Press Health Care Reform Survey, by Stanford University with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, August-September 2010 [United States]","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35884,"dataFile":{"id":2615406,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Associated Press Health Care Reform Survey, by Stanford University with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, August-September 2010 [United States]","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
