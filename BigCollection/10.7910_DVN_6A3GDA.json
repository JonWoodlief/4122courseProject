Past offenders can be punished, while future potential offenders\r\nmay be deterred by the prospect of punishment. Yet, justice is no substitute for intervention for\r\nthe benefit of people at acute risk of being victimized. The Court may create a new moral hazard\r\nproblem if the promise of ex post justice makes it easier for states to shy away from incurring the costs\r\nof intervention. This article indirectly tests for the relevance of this potential problem by estimating\r\nthe determinants of ratification delay to the Rome Statute of the ICC. If the Court represents an\r\nexcuse for inaction, then countries that are unwilling or unable to intervene in foreign conflicts should\r\nbe among its prime supporters. Results show instead that countries that in the past have been more\r\nwilling to intervene in foreign civil wars and more willing to contribute troops to multinational peacekeeping\r\nmissions are more likely to have ratified the Statute (early on). This suggests that the Court is a\r\ncomplement to, not a substitute for intervention"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-02-19"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for JPR (ICC).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124252,"dataFile":{"id":3001791,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6A3GDA/FMCIJQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6A3GDA/FMCIJQ","filename":"Article for JPR (ICC).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":1479,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a568cc190-3b4f9678d7aa","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e9c2f5035d61182f8f14eafb497bdb6c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e9c2f5035d61182f8f14eafb497bdb6c"}}},{"label":"Article for JPR (ICC).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":124252,"dataFile":{"id":3001790,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6A3GDA/2Y6PGW","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6A3GDA/2Y6PGW","filename":"Article for JPR (ICC).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":82284,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a568cc6c1-f58cb39a790e","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:HVKrH6ng/EITBnWVvZoCqw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fd3643ab3ce2162e58e237a64048257a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fd3643ab3ce2162e58e237a64048257a"}}}]}}}
