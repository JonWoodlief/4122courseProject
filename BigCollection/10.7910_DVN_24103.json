Selective herbicides to manage weedy rice in conventional rice cultivars are not available in Sri Lanka. In the absence of appropriate chemical control measures, cultural approaches may help to achieve effective control of weedy rice. A study was conducted in two consecutive seasons in farmersÂÂ fields at three sites (Atalla, Samanthurai, and Girithale villages) in Sri Lanka to evaluate the effect of different establishment methods (farmersÂÂ practice, random broadcast, row seeding, seedling broadcast, and transplanted rice) on weedy rice infestation and rice yield. The farmersÃ¢ÂÂ practice had a higher number of weedy rice panicles (60-80 m-2) than the random broadcast (39-48 panicles m-2), seedling broadcast (3-15 panicles m-2), and transplanted rice (1.3-3.0 panicles m-2) methods. The use of clean rice seeds in the random broadcast method reduced weedy rice seed production by 29-41% compared with the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ practice (0.6-2.0 tÃ¢ÂÂ¢ha-1). Compared with the farmersÃ¢ÂÂ practice, the seedling broadcast method reduced weedy rice seed production by 71-87% and transplanted rice by 95-98%; and increased rice yield by 27-49% (7.5-9.1 t/ha). At all three sites, the farmersÂÂ practice resulted in the lowest grain yield (5.1-6\r\n.7 t/ha). Compared with the farmersÂÂ practice, the random broadcast and row seeding methods increased rice yield by up to 21% and 31%, respectively. The findings suggest that the use of clean rice seeds, the use of a row-seeded crop, and the adoption of different rice planting methods may help to suppress the spread of weedy rice."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Earth and Environmental Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clean seed"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Farmers practice"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Row seeding"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Seedling broadcast"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Transplanted rice"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: null  Type: CESD  Notes: ;"},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Crop Protection"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Elsevier"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/crop-protection"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://cdn.elsevier.com/cover_img/30406.gif"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-01-01"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Abeysekera, A.S.K., Herath, H.M.S., Wickrame, U.B., Johnson, D.E., 2010.
