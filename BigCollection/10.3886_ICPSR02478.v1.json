It investigated the  patterns of criminal behavior that occurred over ten to fifteen years  for men whose early criminal involvement was serious enough to result  in commitment to California Youth Authority (state-level)  institutions. The main focus of the study was on changes in criminal  behavior as these men moved through their 20s and into their 30s. This  study extended and expanded the follow-up data for the study EARLY  IDENTIFICATION OF THE CHRONIC OFFENDER, [1978-1980: CALIFORNIA] (ICPSR  8226). Half of the sample from the earlier study was used in the  present study, along with smaller samples of adult offenders with no  history of state-level commitments as juveniles. These data allow for  analyses of adult patterns of criminal behavior and the relationship  of the patterns to various explanatory variables. Part 1, Offense  Data, contains arrest information covering the period after parole  from the California Youth Authority through the date of data  collection. Variables include entry and release dates to jail,  prison, or probation, the most serious offense and charge, total  number of offenses for violent, property, and all crimes, and dates of  arrest, offense codes, and number of counts for all arrests.  These arrest data incorporate the arrest data contained in EARLY  IDENTIFICATION OF THE CHRONIC OFFENDER, [1978-1980: CALIFORNIA]  (ICPSR 8226) for all California Youth Authority cases in the current  study. Part 2,  Arrest Data by Age and Year, contains counts of arrest charges by type  of offense (violent or nonviolent) and by age and calendar year. Part  3, Arrest Data for Specific Offenses, contains counts of more specific  arrest charges for four-year age blocks (from 18 through 30-plus) for  21 types of offenses, including murder, assault, rape, robbery,  burglary, theft, forgery, arson, and drug possession. Variables  include months of street time, months of incarceration, and total  arrests. Part 4, Prison and Probation Data, contains information on  prison or probation terms and arrest and lifestyle characteristics for  the year immediately prior to and following jail or prison. Variables  include family criminal history, family life, education, entry and  release dates, offenses, treatment and training while incarcerated,  gang affiliation, psychological evaluation, drug use, employment  history, and marital status.

Some key  research questions were: (1) Why do some offenders go to prison early  in life, while others enter later? (2) Does criminal behavior decline  as offenders age, or do offender\ns simply stop their criminal behavior  altogether at some point? (3) Is the amount of criminal behavior  committed by offenders related to their employment or family life or  the use of drugs, as these change over time? This study attempted to  answer these questions by investigating the patterns of criminal  behavior that occurred over a ten- to fifteen-year period for some  1,300 men whose early criminal involvement was serious enough to  result in commitment to California Youth Authority (state-level)  institutions. The main focus of the study was on changes in criminal  behavior as these men moved through their 20s and into their  30s. The goal was to determine whether a policy of selectively  sentencing offenders to prison for longer terms could work to  substantially reduce crime. To that end, the study was organized  primarily around investigating whether the criminal behavior of the offenders in this sample was reasonably stable."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study extended and expanded the follow-up  data for the study EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF THE CHRONIC OFFENDER,  [1978-1980: CALIFORNIA] (ICPSR 8226). That study analyzed data on  subsequent arrests (using the most serious charge for each arrest  incident) over a ten- to fifteen-year period and used attitudinal,  background, and psychological data retained from earlier studies to  predict subsequent offense behavior for juvenile and young adult  offenders committed to the California Youth Authority. Half of this  sample was used in the present study, along with smaller samples of  adult offenders with no history of state-level commitments as  juveniles. More complete arrest histories were obtained, and  information on demographics, family background, adult drug use,  marital status, and employment was coded from prison and/or probation  files. These data allow for extensive analyses of adult patterns of  criminal behavior and the relationship of the patterns to various  explanatory variables. Information on a single prison term (for those  with such terms) or jail/probation term (for cases with such term  information available but without prison terms) was also coded. Data  on arrests and time incarcerated prior to and after these sentences  were used to assess career stability over time and estimate the incapacitation effects of increased sentence lengths."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1, Offense Data, contains arrest information  covering the period after parole from the California Youth Authority  through the date of data collection.
