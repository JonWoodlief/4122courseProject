Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the economy, moral questions, and the situation in the Middle East. Opinions were also sought on the United States Congress, Vice President Al Gore, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Leader Yassir Arafat, as well as South Korea and Egypt. A series of questions addressed the r\necent dismissal by a judge of former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against the president, Starr's investigations into possible Clinton wrongdoing, the alleged affair between Clinton and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and whether Clinton had engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct. Respondents were also asked for their opinions on federal spending on foreign aid, United States sympathies toward the Middle East, whether the United States had vital interests in Israel, the role of Jewish Americans in United States policy toward the Middle East, and the role of Irish Americans in United States policy toward Ireland. In light of the 50th anniversary of the creation of Israel, a series of questions addressed the current state of Israel and policies toward that country. Topics covered Israel's significance as the birthplace of Christianity and Judaism, its status as a democracy, United States aid to Israel, Israel as an ally to the United States, and Israeli influence over United States foreign policy. Additional subjects covered the PLO's commitment to peace, the role of Orthodox rabbis in Israel, interfaith marriages in the Jewish community, and the power of large industries in the business world. Background information on respondents includes age, race, ethnicity, sex, education, marital status, religion, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, family income, age of children in household, and personal visits to Israel."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
