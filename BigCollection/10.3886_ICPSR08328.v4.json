The ori\nginal hierarchical file has, however, been replaced by two rectangular files of which 7,969 are respondent records (one record for each sample woman) and 13,768 are interval records (one record for each closed pregnancy (completed pregnancy) interval reported by sample women).;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Data for CYCLE I, 1973 (ICPSR 7898), CYCLE II, 1976 (ICPSR 7902, 8181), CYCLE IV, 1988 (ICPSR 9473), CYCLE IV, 1990 TELEPHONE REINTERVIEW (ICPSR 6643), CYCLE V, 1995 (ICPSR 6960), and CYCLE VI, 2002 (ICPSR 4157) are also available from ICPSR.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For certain variables, the variable names that appear in the data differ slightly from the variable names given in the original codebook. For example, variables A_1 and A_5B_1 (Respondent File) in the original codebook appear as A1 and A5B1, respectively, in the data.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Codes for variable E26 are undocumented in the original codebook. However, the codes for values of 1 (Yes) and 2 (No) are defined in the original questionnaire. Since yes/no questions follow the same coding scheme, ICPSR has added labels for codes 7 (Refused), 8 (Don't know), and 9 (Not ascertained) based on the assumption that E26 also follows the standard yes/no coding scheme.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Please see the employment codes listed in the 1980 U.S. Census section of the original codebook) for the value labels for the following variables found in the Respondent File: F7, F9, F32_33, F63_64.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For variables MC_2A through MC_9A, there are not value labels for codes greater than 500. Codes between 616 and 720 represent cases for which two birth control methods were used during the same time period. Codes between 816 and 920 represent cases for which two birth control methods were used in sequence during a particular month.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For variable F22_1CM there exists a code which appears to be out of the normal range: '9999999'. There are 6 cases for which a code of '9999999' is given. Code '9999' is a valid code for this variable, representing \"data not ascertained\". The original codebook has 31 cases for which '9999' is given as a response. In the data, the code '9999' is given as a response only 25 times. It is possible that the codes '9999999' were incorrectly coded and were meant to be '9999' (the sum of the two would provide the 31 cases that responded '9999' according to the codebook).;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The following variables have an implied decimal point: AGEDISS, AGEREMAR, AGEDD1, AGECON1, AGEBABY1, FINALWT, FMAR1AGE, MAR2P, and NONRWT (Respondent File) as well as AGEPREG (Interval File). Please consult the codebook for additional information regarding the placement of the decimal point for these data.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Inapplicable responses were originally coded as blanks. However, due to certain limitations in SAS, SPSS, and Stata these have been converted to system missing. As such, the inapplicable statements, originally found in the value labels have been moved to the question text that accompanies the ICPSR Variable Descriptions and can be found in the codebook.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Apparent inconsistencies among related variables result from the use of different items on the questionnaire to define certain concepts. See the section of the original study documentation entitled \"Data Quality\" for additional information.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Data variables are often given as century months. For additional information on how century months are calculated please refer to the \"Date Codes\" section of the codebook.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: In the processing of this study, the original column locations (from the NCHS version) were changed. Throughout the original ASCII data file there were blank columns that served as \"Fillers\". These blank columns were not maintained resulting in different column locations for the majority of variables. Ple\nase disregard the column locations in the original codebook as they no longer apply to the ASCII data file being released with this study;;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: In the latest update to ICPSR 8328, version 3, the widths of the following variables were augmented in order to accommodate the missing data codes; none of the data was affected as there were no cases with missing data: B12_2, B16_2, B16_3, B17_2, B18_2, B18_3, PCT_A, B54_5, B55_5, B54_6, B55_6, B54_7, B55_7, MC_1A, D6_2_3, D8_2_2, D8_2_3, D12_R, D12_H, CH_5, and POVERTY.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The variable F9 has been changed from a 2-digit occupation code to a 3-digit occupation code in this dataset.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: In the update to ICPSR 8328, version 4, the variable POVERTY was corrected and replaced.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1985-05-24"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1982"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1982"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["personal interviews"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["individual"]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A multistage area probability sample of 7,969 women aged 15-44 irrespective of marital status in the noninstitutional population of the conterminous United States.
