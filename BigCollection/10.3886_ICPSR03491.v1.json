To  determine the success of the communication training for the Alachua  deputies, researchers administered a survey to residents in the target  neighborhood before the communication program was implemented (Part  1: Pretest Data) and again after the program had been established  (Part 2: Post-Test Data). The survey instrument developed for use in  this study was designed to assess neighborhood respondents' attitudes  regarding (1) community law enforcement, defined as the assignment of  deputies to neighborhoods on a longer term (not just patrol) basis  with the goal of developing and implementing crime prevention  programs, (2) the communication skills of deputies assigned to the  community, and (3) the perceived importance of community law  enforcement activities. For both parts, residents were asked how  important it was to (1) have the same deputies assigned to their  neighborhoods, (2) personally know the names of their deputies, and  (3) work with the deputies on crime watch programs. Residents were  asked if they agreed that the sheriff's office dealt with the  neighborhood residents effectively, were good listeners, were easy to  talk to, understood and were interested in what the residents had to  say, were flexible, were trustworthy, were safe to deal with, and were  straightforward, respectful, considerate, honest, reliable, friendly,  polite, informed, smart, and helpful.

An  innovative approach that has the potential to increase law enforcement  presence and effectiveness is that of locally-initiated  partnerships. Collabo\nration is a necessary component of success for  many smaller local law enforcement agencies, and the benefits often  extend to larger partners. Continuing and enhancing partnerships among  smaller law enforcement agencies provide benefits to citizens of all  jurisdictions participating in such partnership initiatives. Six  sheriff's offices (Alachua County, Gilchrist County, Columbia County,  Putnam County, Levy County, and Union County Sheriff's Offices)  located in North Central Florida and the University of Florida were  partners in a National Institute of Justice grant designed to enhance  research skills among the partners as they related specifically to  community law enforcement. To this end, the Florida Research Survey  Center developed various training presentations/workshops for the  partners, one of which was communication for law enforcement  personnel. This particular training workshop was presented to deputies  in the Alachua County Sheriff's Office. The workshop was designed to  provide deputies with the skills they needed in order to interact  effectively with community residents. The training consisted of four  modules: (1) effective interpersonal communication, which provided  deputies with a basic understanding of what is meant by effective  interpersonal communication, (2) effective listening, the goal of  which was to teach deputies the distinction between hearing and  listening, (3) nonverbal communication, which dealt with how and when  to make eye contact and the meaning and effective use of other  nonverbal communication, and (4) conflict management, which focused on  how to avoid conflict and develop long-term cooperative relationships  with the community. This study sought to identify the impact of the  communication training program on community attitudes toward  community law enforcement activities, particularly crime prevention and neighborhood patrols."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To determine the success of the communication  training received by the Alachua deputies, researchers administered a  survey to residents in the target neighborhood before the  communication program was implemented (Part 1: Pretest Data) and  again after the program had been established (Part 2: Post-Test  Data).

In  creating the survey instrument, researchers drew from a variety of  concepts and existing scales. The first set of concepts used related  to the Communication Competence Scale (Wiemann, 1977), which assesses  the ability to choose among available communication behaviors to  accomplish one's own interpersonal goals during an encounter. Another  set of concepts was drawn from the Feelings of  Understanding/Misunderstanding Scale (Cahn and Shulman, 1984), which  measures perceptions of feelings of understanding and misunderstanding  when communicating with another person. The Individual Trust Scale  (Wheeless and Grotz, 1977) was developed to measure certain favorable  perceptions of another individual in risky situations in which the  expected outcome of the interaction depends upon another individual  and the outcome is not known. As such, citizen interactions with law  enforcement personnel would be a good fit with measurement objectives  of this particular scale. The final set of concepts for the survey was  drawn from the Source of Credibility Scale (Berlo, Lemert, and Mertz,  1970), which refers to the believability of information and the  dimension of credibility of perceived expertise. Other scales  developed for the survey were\ntaken from validated instruments  contained in Communication Research Measures (Rubin, Palmgreen, and  Sypher [eds.], 1994). These exact scale items were not directly used,  but served merely as a reference for the researchers in creating their  survey instrument. Once the target neighborhood was chosen, research  staff went door-to-door administering the survey in person, because  many of the residents in the chosen neighborhood did not have telephones."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"For both the pre- and the post-test surveys,  residents were asked how important it was to (1) have the same  deputies assigned to their neighborhoods, (2) personally know the  names of their deputies, and (3) work with the deputies on crime watch  programs.
