Data include year the  structure was built, type and number of living quarters, occupancy  status, access, number of rooms, presence of commercial establishments  on the property, and property value. Additional data focus on kitchen  and plumbing facilities, types of heating fuel used, source of water,  sewage disposal, heating and air-conditioning equipment, and major  additions, alterations, or repairs to the property. Information  provided on housing expenses includes monthly mortgage or rent  payments, cost of services such as utilities, garbage collection, and  property insurance, and amount of real estate taxes paid in the  previous year. Also included is information on whether the household  received government assistance to help pay heating or cooling costs or  for other energy-related services. Similar data are provided for  housing units previously occupied by respondents who had recently  moved. Additionally, indicators of housing and neighborhood quality  are supplied. Housing quality variables include privacy of bedrooms,  condition of kitchen facilities, basement or roof leakage, breakdowns  of plumbing facilities and equipment, and overall opinion of the  structure. For quality of neighborhood, variables include use of  exterminator services, existence of boarded-up buildings, and overall  quality of the neighborhood. In addition to housing characteristics,  some demographic data are provided on household members, suc\nh as age,  sex, race, marital status, income, and relationship to householder.  Additional data provided on the householder include years of school  completed, Spanish origin, length of residence, and length of

All  interviews are conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing  (CAPI) software, allowing new responses to some questions. Rather than  existing as a single file, this collection consists of ten parts, each  containing data pertaining to a specific subject-matter. In addition,  data for building and neighborhood questions ceased to be collected  through interviewer observation. Rather, these questions have been  reworded for the respondents. Due to these changes, users are asked to  use caution when comparing data prior to 1997 with data from 1997  forward. For further information about the redesign, please refer to  DOCUMENTATION OF CHANGES IN THE 1997 AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY included  with AMERICAN HOUSING SURVEY, 1997: NATIONAL MICRODATA (ICPSR 2912).

The same basic sample of  housing units is interviewed every two years until a new sample is  selected. The Census Bureau updated the sample by adding newly  constructed housing units and units discovered through coverage  improvement efforts every enumeration. For the 1999 American Housing  Survey-National (AHS-N), approximately 60,700 sample housing units  were selected for interview. About 2,300 of these units were found to  be ineligible because the unit no longer existed or because the units  did not meet the AHS-N definition of a housing unit. Of the 58,400  eligible sample units, about 5,800 were classified (both occupied and  vacant housing units), as \"Type A\" noninterviews because (a) no one  was at home after repeated visits, (b) the respondent refused to be  interviewed, or (c) the interviewer was unable to find the unit. This  classification produced a 90-percent overall response rate. The AHS  sample consists of the following types of units in the sampled primary  sampling units: housing units selected from the 1980 Census, new  construction in areas requiring building permits, housing units missed  in the 1980 Census, and other housing units added since the 1980  Census.
