The study assessed  familial and nonfamilial types of violence. It was designed as a  telephone survey of American youth aged 12-17 living in United States  households and residing with a parent or guardian. One parent or  guardian in each household was interviewed briefly to establish  rapport, secure permission to interview the targeted adolescent, and  to ensure the collection of comparative data to examine potential  nonresponse bias from households without adolescent participation.  All interviews with both parents and adolescents were conducted using  Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology. From the  surveys of parents and adolescents, the principal investigators  created one data file by attaching the data from the parents to the  records of their respective adolescents. Adolescents were asked  whether violence and drug abuse were problems in their schools and  communities and what types of violence they had personally  witnessed. They were also asked about other stressful events in their  lives, such as the loss of a family member, divorce, unemployment,  moving to a new home or school, serious illness or injury, and natural  disaster. Questions regarding history of sexual assault, physical  assault, and harsh physical discipline elicited a description of the  event and perpetrator, extent of injuries, age at abuse, whether  alcohol or drugs were involved, and who was informed of the  incident. Information was also gathered on the delinquent behavior of  respondents and their friends, including destruction of property,  assault, theft, sexual assault, and gang activity. Other questions  covered history of personal and family substance use and mental health  indicators, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorders,  weight changes, sleeping disorders, and problems  concentrating. Demographic information was gathered from the  adolescents on age, race, gender, number of people living in  household, and grade in school. Parents were asked whether they were  concerned about violent crime, affordable child care, drug abuse,  educational quality, gangs, and the safety of their children at  school. In addition, they were questioned about their own  victimization experiences and whether they discussed personal safety  issues with their children. Parents also supplied demographic  information on gender, marital status, number of children, employment status, education, race, and income."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Childhood victimization has been found to be  strongly related to substance use/abuse/dependence, delinquent  behavior, and a variety of other mental, emotional, and behavioral  problems. In the past, studies have either examined victimization by  studying family violence and ignored other victimization experiences,  or have assessed criminal violence and disregarded violence  perpetrated by family members. This study assessed both familial and  nonfamilial violence. The goal of the study was to test specific  hypotheses generated by a theoretically and empirically constructed  conceptual framework that illustrated the rela\ntionships among serious  victimization experiences, the mental health effects of victimization,  substance use/abuse, and delinquent behavior. The research objectives  were (1) to provide descriptive information about cases of familial  and nonfamilial violent assault, delinquent behavior, mental health  problems, and substance use, abuse, and dependence, broken down by  age, gender, family income, and racial/ethnic group among American  adolescents, (2) to test a risk factor model that hypothesized  relationships between violent familial and nonfamilial victimization  in childhood and adolescence and risk of post traumatic stress  disorder, delinquent behavior, and substance use, abuse, and  dependence, and (3) to examine potential differences between gender  and ethnic minority groups in the correlates and consequences of  substance use/abuse/dependence and delinquent behavior. The primary  hypothesis of this study was that victimization during childhood  and/or adolescence increased the risk of developing significant  psychological distress and substance use, which in turn increased risk  for substance abuse or dependence, delinquent behavior, and subsequent victimization."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The study was designed as a telephone survey of  American youth between the ages of 12-17 who (1) were living in  United States households with telephones, (2) resided with a parent or  guardian, and (3) could converse in English or Spanish. All sample  selection and interviewing was done by Schulman, Ronca, and Bucuvalas,  Inc. (SRBI), a New York-based survey research team. All interviews  with both parents and adolescents were conducted using  Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology. After  determining that the household contained one or more eligible  adolescents, interviewers asked to speak to a parent or guardian. One  parent or guardian in each household was interviewed briefly to  establish rapport, secure permission to interview the targeted  adolescent, and to ensure the collection of comparative data to  examine potential nonresponse bias from households without adolescent  participation. Parents and guardians were provided the opportunity to  call a toll-free number to confirm the authenticity of the  study. Whenever possible, adolescents were interviewed immediately  following the parent or guardian interviews. Otherwise, appointments  were scheduled when possible or blind callbacks at different times of  the day or days of the week were made. As an incentive for  participation, adolescent participants received a certificate of  participation in the \"National Survey of Adolescents\" and a check for  five dollars as compensation for their time.
