Respondents were asked if   they thought various tobacco products were dangerous, if they felt   pressure from friends to smoke cigarettes, if anyone in their   household used tobacco, if they would be more or less likely to like   or date someone who smoked, and if they themselves smoked cigarettes   or cigars or used chewing tobacco or snuff. To investigate exposure   to tobacco advertising, respondents were asked if they had received   free samples of tobacco products or promotional items for tobacco   products (e.g., caps, T-shirts, sunglasses, posters), if they were   familiar with various cigarette advertising slogans, and which brands   of cigarettes they had seen advertised in recent months. The survey   probed beliefs about the dangers to health caused by tobacco use and   asked respondents if they favored implementation of a 'smoke-free'   policy in their schools, and if they favored laws forbidding the sale   of tobacco to everyone, to persons under 21, or only to minors under   18. Other questions queried respondents about their concerns that   tobacco was addictive, caused bad breath, stained teeth, was   expensive, or was disapproved of by parents and friends. In addition,   the survey assessed beliefs about the dangers of alcohol, marijuana,   cocaine, and crack, the amount of peer pressure felt by respondents   to drink or use drugs, and respondents' feelings of closeness to   their families, general happiness, frequency of depression or   sadness, level of stress in life, excitement about the future, and   religiosity. Respondents who smoked cigarettes were questioned about   how much they smoked, how and where they purchased cigarettes, how   difficult it was for people their age to buy cigarettes in their   community, whether they preferred strong, medium, mild, menthol, or   nonmenthol cigarettes, which brand they bought when they last   purchased cigarettes, how soon after they woke up they had their   first cigarette, and how old they were when they smoked their first   cigarette, started to inhale, and bought their first pack of   cigarettes. Cigarette smokers were also asked if they had considered   stopping or tried to stop smoking, if they were interested in   participating in a 'stop smoking' program, and whether they would try   to stop or reduce their cigarette consumption if the price of   cigarettes were increased by one or two dollars per pack. Additional   information gathered by the survey includes age, sex, race, Hispanic   origin, degree of urbanization, state of residence, occupation of   chief wage earner in the family, educational attainment of each   parent, religious preference, amount of church/synagogue attendance,   use of alcohol and marijuana, self-assessed academic standing and   likelihood of graduation from high school, and plans after high  school."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adolescents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"advertising"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"religious behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"smoking"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"stress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tobacco products"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tobacco use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA III.
