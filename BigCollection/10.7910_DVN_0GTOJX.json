In order to investigate how to set up the production of knowledge on this subject was conducted an exploratory and descriptive study with bibliometric approach. Data were collected in the current base of the Research Group Directory at Brazil's National Scientific and Technological Development Council (DGPB / CNPq) and in the Lattes curricula of group leaders. The results indicated that were formed 36 groups between 2000 and 2016, with most of the area of education (86.71%), led by 51 researchers with the title of doctors and eight with the title of master, with a predominance of women. The groups are located in the regions: Northeast (33.3%), Southeast (22.2%), South (16.7%), the North (16.7%) and Midwest (11.1%). Together, they develop 106 lines of research, especially the theme \"Teacher Training and Field Educators\". The scientific production of the leaders in the past five years totaled 74 articles in 52 journals, as well as 37 books and 92 book chapters, demonstrating the importance of research developed by Rural Education in groups."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Arts and Humanities"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rural education"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Scientific Production"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bibliometrics"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Araujo, Gustavo"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-09-05"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Full text","label":"Article","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":87204,"dataFile":{"id":2867624,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/0GTOJX/BCIDUE","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0GTOJX/BCIDUE","filename":"Article","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":767234,"description":"Full text","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:156fbed929f-9c6a2eb2c96b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e6eda3b63d05447360d95f1ac96fc99f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e6eda3b63d05447360d95f1ac96fc99f"}}}]}}}
