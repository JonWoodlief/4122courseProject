The research team for this study was asked to review a 1996  profile of inmates in the Los Angeles jail system and to determine how  many of them might have been good candidates for intermediate  sanctions such as electronic monitoring, work release, house arrest,  and intensive supervision. The researchers selected a sample of 1,000  pre-adjudicated (or unconvicted) inmates from the total census of  inmates in jail custody on January 15, 1996, to study in more detail.  Of the 1,000 offenders, the researchers were able to obtain jail and  recidivism data for two years for 931 inmates. For each of these  offenders, information on their prior criminal history, current  offense, and subsequent recidivism behavior was obtained from official  records maintained by several county agencies, including pretrial  services, sheriff's department, probation, and courts. Demographic  variables include date of birth, race, and gender. Prior criminal  history variables for each prior adult arrest include type of filing  charge, case disposition, type of sentence and sentence length  imposed, and total number of prior juvenile petitions sustained.  Current offense variables include arrest date, crime type for current  arrest, crime charge, type and date of final case disposition, and  sentence type and length, if convicted. Strike information collected  includes number of strikes and the offense that qualified as a  strike. Jail custody variables include the jail entry and exit data  for the current offense and the reason for release, if released.

Two possible  solutions to the problem were to build more jail capacity or to divert  a greater number of incoming inmates to community-based, intermediate  sanctions.

(2) How serious was the pre-adjudicated sample, if  judged by prior record and current offense? (3) For those whose cases  were disposed during the two-year follow-up, what were the final  dispositions? (4) For those who were released to the community during  the two-year follow-up, how many recidivated and to what kinds of  crimes?
