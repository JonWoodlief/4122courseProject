Information  from the 1995 gang structures survey provides detail on the ethnic  distributions of gangs, whether a predominant gang structure was  present, each gang structure's typical size, and the total number of  each of the five gang structures identified by the principal  investigators -- chronic traditional, emergent traditional, emergent  integrated, expanded integrated, and specialty integrated.

The  researchers utilized data from two sources to calculate estimates of  the national prevalence of various types of gang structures, and of  the perceived patterns of criminal activity associated with each  structure.

For the 1992 study, the researchers obtained  membership lists of gang investigator associations and solicited  candidate municipalities from law enforcement contacts across the  country. The primary agency responsible for policing each city was  identified from the 1991 National Directory of Law Enforcement  Administrators. If the municipality contracted police ser\nvices to an  agency other than the local police department, this agency was  contacted instead. In order to learn more about the varieties of gang  types nationally, and how these might relate to different forms of  crime, the researchers administered the gang structures survey in 1995  to a sample of the same law enforcement agencies from the 1992  survey. First, the researchers faxed or mailed the descriptions of the  five types of gangs to the law enforcement officers. Then the law  enforcement officers were contacted for an interview. At the  beginning of the interview, the researchers ascertained that the  officers had reviewed the descriptions, since survey questions were based on understanding the descriptions."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Information taken from the 1992 study included the  year of gang emergence in the city, numbers of active gangs and gang  members, ethnic distribution of gang members, numbers of gang  homicides and \"drive-bys\" in 1991, state in which the city is located,  and population of the city.
