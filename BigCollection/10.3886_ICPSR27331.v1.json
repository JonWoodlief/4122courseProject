Respondents were also asked for their opinions of senatorial candidates Jim Gilmore and Mark Warner, for whom they would vote if the United States Senate election in Virginia were held that day, whether they wanted to see a Democrat or Republican win Virginia's governor's race in 2009 , and for whom they would vote in Virginia's Democratic primary for governor.

The weights were derived using demographic information from the Census to adjust for sampling and nonsampling deviations from population values. Until 2008 ABC News used a cell-based weighting system in which respondents were classified into one of 48 or 32 cells (depending on sample size) based on their age, race, sex, and education; weights were assigned so the proportion in each cell matched the Census Bureau's most recent Current Population Survey. To achieve greater consistency and reduce the chance of large weights, ABC News in 2007 tested and evaluated iterative weighting, commonly known as raking or rim weighting, in which the sample is weighted sequentially to Census targets one variable at a time, continuing until the optimum distribution across variables (again, age, race, sex, and education) is achieved. ABC News adopted rim weighting in January 2008. Weights are capped at lows of 0.2 and highs of 6.The oversample 18- to 29-year-old respondents were weighed back to their correct share of the national population."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Washington Post Virginia Poll, October 2008","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35330,"dataFile":{"id":2611357,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Washington Post Virginia Poll, October 2008","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
