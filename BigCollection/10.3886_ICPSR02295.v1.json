Data were collected on participants (clients) across four types of treatment programs, or modalities: residential, residential \"social mod\nel,\" nonmethadone outpatient, and outpatient methadone (detoxification and maintenance). Data were collected in two phases. In Phase 1, treatment records were abstracted for clients who received treatment or were discharged between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1992. In Phase 2, these clients were located and recruited for a follow-up interview. The CALDATA design and procedures included elements from several national treatment outcome studies including the Drug Services Research Survey (IC\nPSR 3393), Services Research Outcomes Study (ICPSR 2691), National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (ICPSR 2884), and Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (ICPSR 2258). The record abstract was designed to collect identifying and locating information for interview reference during the personal interviewing phase. The abstract also collected demographic, drug, or alcohol use, and treatment and service information. The follow-up questionnaire covered time periods before, during, and after treat\nment and focused on topics such as ethnic and educational background, drug and alcohol use, mental and physical health, HIV and AIDS status, drug testing, illegal activities and criminal status, living arrangements and family issues, employment and income, and treatment for drug, alcohol, and mental health problems. Drugs included alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine powder, crack, downers, hallucinogens, heroin, illegal methadone, inhalants, LSD, marijuana/hashish/THC, methamphetamin\nes and other stimulants, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, PCP, ritalin or preludin, and sedatives/hypnotics.

Selection chances for the non-certainty counties were weighted based on the number of participants. In the second stage of s\nampling, treatment providers were selected using similar principles of geographically balanced, size weighted random selection. In order to analyze each treatment modality, approximately equal numbers of facilities were selected across the modalities. As with counties, the smallest providers were clustered to provide adequately sized sampling units. In the third stage, client records were randomly chosen at each sampled facility with the number varying by the size of the provider and the extent\nto which the on-site listing of clients matched the number expected for that provider.
