confidence that it has been responsible for at least one attack (rather than just being suspected of such activity) and there is a high-level of confidence that at least one activity by the

team devised criteria and a systematic method for vetting groups for inclusion, concluding that the ultimate criterion for inclusion in PPT-US was whether a group had conducted at least one attack in the United States (including Puerto Rico) since 1970, and whether that attack met the inclusion criteria of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) as a terrorist attack. That is, any group identified in the GTD as a perpetrator of an attack targeting the U.S. homeland was included in PPT-US. Groups thought to be suspicious, dangerous, or known to espouse extremist ideology but that had never launched a terrorist attack against the United States were omitted from PPT-US. Therefore, the list of groups included in PPT-US is derived empirically from the incident-level data, rather than adopting a priori classification of a ‘terrorist organization.’ This produced a mix of groups based in the United States as well as groups based overseas that launched attacks in the United States The GTD defines terrorism as “the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion or intimidation.” Specifically, incidents reflect the following three attributes: (1) the incident must be intentional; (2) the incident must entail some level of violence or threat of violence; and (3) the perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD: (1) the act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, or religious goal; (2) there must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) other than the immediate victims; and (3) the action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. Additional criteria were developed for including an organization in PPT-US. First, the GTD includes a variable that indicates whether there was doubt regarding inclusion of the incident into the database. Doubt is expressed if the incident could be considered insurgency, another type of crime, or intra/inter group conflict, as well as whether the attack may have lacked intentionality or whether it may have been committed by a state actor. Over fourteen percent of the 2,758 U.S. terrorist attacks in the GTD between 1970 and 2016 have been flagged by the GTD team as incidents in which the necessary inclusion criteria are satisfied yet the designation of terrorism is doubted. If such uncertainty existed for all of a specific group’s activities, that group was excluded from PPT. In addition, in attributing responsibility for specific incidents in the GTD to organizations, coders recorded whether there is high confidence that an organization is, in fact, responsible for the attack or, conversely, whether the group is only the suspected perpetrator. Only GTD groups for which there is high confidence of responsibility for at least one attack are included in PPT-US. By applying these selection criteria, 145 groups were identified for inclusion. Data on identified groups were systematically collected using numerous unclassified materials, which, based on several pilot profiles, were chosen because they provided the richest and most reliable information. In addition to academic books and journals, websites and search engines were used to identify relevant information. Coders were tasked with following four search guidelines. First, collectors were expected to search all of the following search engines: Lexis-Nexis; ProQuest; Infotrac; World Quest; Yahoo; Google (general, scholar and books); all the web; and Infomine. Second, collectors were reminded to vary search terms when little information was initially found. Third, for cases with overwhelming amounts of data about a group, data collectors were encouraged to include in the data bank only one story from each day unless each story had unique or additional information. Lastly, collectors were expected to pay careful attention to the date of each source. More recent articles may provide useful or updated information about the group. Note that for five groups, coders were unable to locate any sources of information whatsoever."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Record abstracts"},{"typeName":"datasetLevelErrorNotes","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Since the data is collected through open sources, information on some variables, including group structure, size, financial strategies and recruitment strategies, were difficult or impossible to obtain for some organizations. The chosen organizations are based on data gathered and distributed by the GTD, which has potential limits on the certainty of the perpetrating organization. This database should therefore be seen as a conservative account of perpetrators of terrorism in the United States. PPT-US only includes data on terrorist organizations; individuals who have engaged in terrorism independent from an organization are not included in this data set."}]}},"files":[{"label":"PPT Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":127645,"dataFile":{"id":3037404,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"PPT Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":293880,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15d663d54e8-3ee44cfe9e5e","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"01a31a6eccf1c4da6acbfaeb82f94cc6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"01a31a6eccf1c4da6acbfaeb82f94cc6"}}},{"label":"PPT-US_0517dist.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":127645,"dataFile":{"id":3037405,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"PPT-US_0517dist.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":490416,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15d663d5b2b-a17709cd2b8b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"8313d52b8860578824a8ec0fbdbb16c8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"8313d52b8860578824a8ec0fbdbb16c8"}}}]}}}
