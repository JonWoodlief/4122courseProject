Several strategies for imputing missing  homicide data have been suggested in recent years. However, aside from  assessing their logic and the degree to which findings based on  imputed data are in accordance with what is known broadly about  homicide, such strategies are difficult to evaluate for the reason  that the \"true\" values for cases with missing data cannot be  observed. By combining different datasets available through the  National Archive of Criminal Justice Data, this project offered a  strategy for both testing imputation approaches that have been  suggested in the literature and for using these results to advance the development of new methods for imputing SHR data."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In order to better understand why data are missing  and how missing and nonmissing data differ, Supplementary Homicide  Reports (SHR) and local police data from Chicago, Illinois, St. Louis,  Missouri, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona, for 1990 to  1995 were merged to create a master file. The researchers used  overlapping information on victim and incident characteristics from  the SHR and police data from fields for which the data are very rarely  missing even if the offender is unknown (age, sex, and race of  victims, month of incident, and weapon) to link the two types of data  sources. While this process became challenging when the  characteristics of victims and incidents were identical across  multiple incidents in a given month, this type of situation was  extremely rare as usually at least one characteristic varied across  incidents. Through this process, 96 percent of the cases in the SHR  were matched with cases in the police files.
