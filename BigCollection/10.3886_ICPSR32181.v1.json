The scenarios described a store robbery in which identification by one eyewitness was the only evidence against the defendant.

Only the data from counties in which there were completed test materials from both the offices of the District Attorney and the Public Defender were included in this study. This was done to match the two samples, at least in terms of the counties in which they served.
