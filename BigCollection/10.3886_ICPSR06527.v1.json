The 22  correctional officers who participated in this study were recruited  from the Florida Department of Corrections Probation Field Services  Divisions, and worked within Pinellas and Pasco counties. Each  officer was requested to solicit from his or her caseload eight to ten  probationers who would be eligible for the project because they would  be undergoing at least monthly urinalysis or urine testing.  Approximately 150 probationers participated in the project and were  subject to hair assays for illicit drug use, along with standard urine  testing. Specimens were collected and analyzed on 90  probationers over a six-month period and on 101 probationers for five  consecutive months, as well as fewer numbers of samples for the other  probationers. The drugs for which the hair and urine specimens were  analyzed included cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids such as marijuana,  PCP, and methadone. Survey questions asked of the probation officers  (Part 1) covered personal information (gender, ethnicity, education  level, years of experience in corrections, and satisfaction with job)  and attitudes and opinions about their jobs and drug testing  (estimated percentage of caseload using drugs, whether all clients  should be tested, and whether knowing drug quantities is helpful).  Data in Part 2 cover probationers' drug test results and self-reported  drug use, personal information (gender, age,  weight, ethnicity, and criminal charge), a variety of hair questions  (color, texture, style, length, how often shampooed, and if dyed,  tinted, bleached, relaxed, or jeried), and use of medications, along with the medication name and amount."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This project involved the recruitment and  retention of approximately 150 probationers in Pinellas and Pasco  counties, Florida, who were subject to hair assays and urine testing  for illicit drug use over a period of time ranging from one to six  months.

The major  distinction of this project is its focus on the evaluation of the  difficulties and experiences associated with implementing a hair  testing regimen in a correctional agency. The project did not  institute a complete hair testing program. The project, however,  sought to simulate major features of such an implementation. In that  regard, the research project put emphasis on \"normal work\"  integration and \"real world\" applicability. In this sense, the  project sought to insert a simple hair specimen collection protocol in  the normal working relationship between selected probation officers and their probationer caseload."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The 22 correctional officers who participated in  this study were\nrecruited from the Florida Department of Corrections  Probation Field Services Divisions, and worked within Pinellas and  Pasco counties. Each officer was requested to approach and solicit  from his or her caseload eight to ten probationers who would be  eligible for the project because they would be undergoing at least  monthly urine testing. The participation of all parties was voluntary,  and the data were not used for any decisions regarding case  disposition or treatment. Each probationer was required to sign an  informed consent form. Probation officers were trained to collect hair  specimens and to incorporate the hair collection procedure into their  normal routine with their probationers. The project intended to  recruit between 150-200 volunteer probationers with the supposition  that approximately 100 would persist in participation for the entire  six months of the project. Specimens were collected and analyzed on 90  probationers over a six-month period and on 101 probationers for five  consecutive months, as well as fewer numbers of samples for the other  probationers. The drugs for which the hair and urine specimens were  analyzed included cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, PCP, and methadone.  The urine samples were analyzed by EMIT using National Institute on  Drug Abuse (NIDA)-recommended cutoff values. The hair samples were  taken simultaneously with the urine specimens and were analyzed by the  Psychemedics Corporation of Culver City, California. The cutoff values  were the lowest recommended by the testing laboratory as detectable (2  ng/10 mg for cocaine and opiates, .05 ng/10 mg for cannabinoids).
