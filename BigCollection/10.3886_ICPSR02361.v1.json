Data were collected  from middle school, high school, and college students in the Eugene,  Oregon, a\nrea via self-completion questionnaires, between October 1992  and April 1993. Given the opportunity to appear in a television ad,  respondents were asked to characterize the factors that would  influence their decision to participate. Factors included similar past  experiences, input from family members and friends, expected return  from participating, other commitments, future goals, and personal  feelings. Those queried were then asked which factors would influence  whether they had a positive or negative experience, such as the amount  of thought they put into the decision, whether there was enough  information available to make a good decision, and whether it worked  out. In addition, each cohort was asked further questions. Part 1,  Spencer Butte Middle School Data, contains data from 113 7th-grade  students, collected during the month of October 1992. Respondents were  asked what came to their minds when asked to think about  \"decision-making\". Those queried were given five scenarios, such as  being asked to join friends for a late movie and being asked to help a  friend with homework, and were asked how they would respond in each  situation. Background information on respondents includes sex. Part 2,  Sheldon High School Data, contains data from 224 9th-grade students,  collected during January 1993. Part 3, International High School Data,  contains data from 88 9th-grade students, collected during January  1993. Respondents in both Parts 2 and 3 completed the same survey  instrument. Those queried were given five scenarios, such as spending  money received as a gift to purchase a CD player or going on a  three-week trip to Africa, and asked how they would respond in each  situation. Respondents were asked which factors would influence their  decision to accept an after-school job offer. Those queried were also  asked how they would advise a friend to spend their spring break,  studying or traveling. Respondents were asked to describe one big  decision that they had made that semester. Background information on  respondents includes sex, current employment status, and past  employment experience. Part 4, University of Oregon Data, contains  data from 70 student respondents collected during April  1993. Respondents were asked to assess their own decision-making  skills, the amount of important decisions they made, and their  attitudes toward decision-making, including the influence of others on  the decision-making process and whether they liked decisions to be made for them. Background information on respondents includes sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"advertising"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"secondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"student attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"students"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"television"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.C.1.
