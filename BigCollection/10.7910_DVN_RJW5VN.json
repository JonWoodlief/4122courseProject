So far, we lack knowledge whether playing in neutral venues indeed removes many, if not all, theoretically assumed advantages of playing at home. Analysing over 3,500 Gaelic football and hurling matches – field games with the highest participation rates in Ireland – between 2009 and 2018, we test the potential moderating influence of neutral venues. In hurling and Gaelic football, a considerable share of matches in played at neutral venues. We test the influence of neutral venues based on descriptive statistics, and multilevel logistic and multinomial regressions controlling for team strength, the importance of the match, the year, and the sport. With predicted probabilities ranging between 0.8 and 0.9, the favourite team is very likely to win home matches. The predicted probability drops below 0.6 for away matches. At neutral venues, the favourite team has a predicted probability of winning of 0.7. A Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) approach also reveals very substantive and significant effects for the ‘treatment’ of neutral venues. Overall, neutral venues appear to be an under-utilised option for creating fairer and less predictable competition, especially in single-game knock-out matches."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-17"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Müller, Stefan"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-17"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Spreadsheet with results from Gaelic football matches (http://gaarankings.net)","label":"gaa_results_football.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":141839,"dataFile":{"id":3224814,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RJW5VN/9IPJDM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RJW5VN/9IPJDM","filename":"gaa_results_football.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":466313,"description":"Spreadsheet with results from Gaelic football matches (http://gaarankings.net)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165e76dc3d9-7baa2967328a","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4506c2783445737b230c2cbf72886697","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4506c2783445737b230c2cbf72886697"}}},{"description":"Spreadsheet with results from hurling matches (http://gaarankings.net)","label":"gaa_results_hurling.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":141839,"dataFile":{"id":3224815,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RJW5VN/VNCXSI","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RJW5VN/VNCXSI","filename":"gaa_results_hurling.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":415113,"description":"Spreadsheet with results from hurling matches (http://gaarankings.net)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165e76dc516-aae0e0f1204b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"78be9bd6aae4bd0bff2636fa90198786","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"78be9bd6aae4bd0bff2636fa90198786"}}},{"description":"RProj file.
