The judges then report sentences to the Commission on a  Guideline Sentence Form. This data collection reflects all felonies  and misdemeanors reported to the Commission that were sentenced during  calendar year 1998. The data are contained in four files reflecting  three sets of sentencing guidelines. The 1991 sentencing guidelines  pertain to all offenses committed on or after August 9, 1991, up until  the time that the 1994 guidelines became effective. The 1994  sentencing guidelines became effective for all offenses committed on  or after August 12, 1994. The 1997 sentencing guidelines became  effective for all offenses committed on or after June 13, 1997. In  this data collection, the variable \"GLEPOCH\" denotes which set of  guidelines pertained to the offense. Because the 1997 guidelines  differ significantly from the 1991 and 1994 guidelines, sentences  under the 1997 guidelines are reported in separate datasets. Parts 1  and 2, Records Data, provide information on each offender, including  rudimentary demographic characteristics and prior offense  history. Parts 3 and 4, Offense Data, contain information on each  offense, including the statutory citation for the offense, the Offense  Gravity Score assigned by the Commission, the offender's Prior Record  Score, and the sentence given the offender. Parts 1 and 3 contain data  from cases sentenced under the 1991 and 1994 guidelines, while Parts 2 and 4 contain data from cases sentenced under the 1997 guidelines."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"felony offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"misdemeanor offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sentencing guidelines"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

Files can be linked using the Commission ID (CID). In the  Records Data (Parts 1 and 2), the CID is unique. In the Offense Data  (Parts 3 and 4), one CID can have multiple offenses. (2) The unit of  analysis is determined by the user but could include: (a) Judicial  proceeding: A proceeding in which all offenses for which the offender  was convicted were pending before the court for sentencing at the same  time. (b) Transaction: A crime or crimes committed by an offender at a  single time or in temporally continuous actions that were part of the  same episode, event, or incident, or which were conspiracy and the  offense that was conspired to. There can be multiple transactions  within one judicial proceeding. Guidelines for\n1997 do not use  transaction. (c) Offense: There can be multiple offenses within one  transaction. (3) These data represent the public version of the 1998  sentencing data for which three confidential variables (offender's  name, Social Security number, judge's name) were removed from the  dataset and four additional variables (docket number, offense tracking  number, police photo identification number, and state identification  number) were blanked by ICPSR. Information on obtaining the full  dataset is provided in the codebook. (4) The codebook and data  collection instruments are provided by ICPSR as a Portable Document  Format (PDF) file.
