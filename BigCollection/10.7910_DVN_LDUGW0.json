Yet questions remain about what motivates participation between those points on the causal chain, or under any conditions of high risk. To explain these anomalies, I employ theories of moral identity to explore the interdependence of a facet of decision-making that rationalist models typically regard as fixed: individuals’ awareness of and need to express values central to their sense of self. Three mechanisms describe ways that individuals’ responses to early risers trigger moral identity-based motivations for protest. First, in conjuring normative ideals, first movers can activate bystanders’ urge to follow their example in order to earn their own self-respect. Second, in demonstrating the joy of agency, early risers can inspire bystanders’ desire to experience the same gratification. Third, in absorbing punishments, early risers can activate onlookers’ sense of moral obligation to contribute to collective efforts. These mechanisms redouble bystanders’ sense of the inherent value of protest, apart from its instrumental utility, and intensify their acceptance of risks, independent of the actual risks anticipated. Original interviews with displaced Syrians about their participation in demonstrations illustrate these processes."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Protest, social movements, cascades, identity"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pearlman, Wendy"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-16"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Essay discussing the methods by which this data was collected and analyzed in producing this article","label":"MethodsNoteIdentityanCascadesSyria","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":80139,"dataFile":{"id":2793028,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/LDUGW0/9BEGHM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LDUGW0/9BEGHM","filename":"MethodsNoteIdentityanCascadesSyria","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":163835,"description":"Essay discussing the methods by which this data was collected and analyzed in producing this article","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1537ed28f8c-dbcccaf2ae63","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"54c335bba5c14ed78be58a0593107ee7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"54c335bba5c14ed78be58a0593107ee7"}}}]}}}
