Indexation is assured by  institutions and contract provisions that protect people against the  effects of unanticipated inflation, as measured by a consumer price  index or similar index. Examples of institutions that promote  indexation are cost of living allowances, escalator clauses, or  inflation-protected bonds. Subjects were interviewed to understand  their lack of interest in indexation. Questionnaire surveys were  administered in the United States and in Turkey (where inflation rates  are much higher and where there is still little indexation) in  1996. Many causes of this lack of interest in indexation are studied,  prominent among them being lack of appreciation of inflation  uncertainty, lack of trust in the government, and beliefs that high  inflation, if it were to come, would coincide with times of economic and political instability."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
