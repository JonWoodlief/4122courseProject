The study sought to answer: (1) What is the prevalence of officer fatigue, and what are officers' attitudes toward it? (2) What are the causes or correlates of officer fatigue? (3) How does fatigue affect officer safety, health, and job performance? and (4) Can officer fatigue be measured objectively? The final sample was comprised of all sworn, nonsupervisory police officers assigned full-time to patrol and/or community policing functions on the day that data collection began at each of four selected sites: Lowell, Massachusetts, Polk County, Florida, Portland, Oregon, and Arlington County, Virginia. Part 1, Fatigue Survey Data, includes demographic data and officers' responses from the initial self-report survey. Variables include the extent to which the respondent felt hot or cold, experienced uncomfortable breathing, bad dreams, or pain while sleeping, the time the respondent usually went to bed, number of hours slept each night, quality of sleep, whether medicine was taken as a sleep aid, estimated hours worked in a one-, two-, seven-, and thirty-day period, how overtime affected income, family relationships, and social activities, and reasons for feeling tired. Part 2, Demographic and Fatigue Survey Data, is comprised of data obtained from administrative records and demographic data forms. Several measures from the initial self-report survey are also included in Part 2. Variables focus on respondents' age, sex, race, marital status, global score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, total years as a police officer assigned to any agency and current agency, and total years worked in current shift. Data for Part 3, FIT and Administrative Data, were obtained from administrative records and from the fitness-for-duty (FIT) workplace screener test. Variables include a pupilometry index score and the dates, time, and particular shift (days, evenings, or midnight) the officer started working when the pupilometry test was administered. Part 3 also includes the number of hours worked by the officer in a regular shift or in association with overtime, the number of sick leave hours taken by the officer, and whether the officer was involved in an on-duty accident, injured on duty, or commended by his/her department during a particular shift."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The effects of fatigue on human behavior,  performance, and physiology are well understood and widely  known. Excess fatigue arising from sleep loss, circadian disruption,  and other factors tends to decrease alertness, impair performance, and  worsen mood. As such, it is reasonable to expect that the performance,  health, and safety of patrol officers, as well as police-community  relations, are adversely affected by the fatigue an officer may  experience. This study was undertaken to assess the connections  between administratively controllable sou\nrces of fatigue among police  patrol officers and problems such as diminished performance,  accidents, and illness. The study sought to answer: (1) What is the  prevalence of officer fatigue, and what are officers' attitudes toward  it? (2) What are the causes or correlates of officer fatigue?

Once the officers meeting the selection criteria were  identified and the purpose of the study was explained during the  officers' roll call sessions, officers were asked to volunteer to  participate in the study. All participating officers were assigned  identification numbers and given initial self-report surveys to  complete during a roll call briefing. The survey instrument included  all 19 items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), combined  with additional questions designed to capture information on officer  demographics, experience, attitudes regarding fatigue held by  respondents themselves and their peers, and perceptions regarding the  causes and effects of fatigue, particularly on professional  performance and physical and emotional well-being. The PSQI was scored  as a global index as well as on seven sub-scales. These included sleep  quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency,  sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime  dysfunction. Demographic information was also collected later from  either demographic data forms placed in officers' mailboxes (with  instructions to complete and return to the on-site study coordinator)  in Polk and Arlington counties, or from administrative records for  officers in Portland and Lowell. In addition to the subjective  measures of fatigue, all officers were asked to take a non-invasive  eye-reduction test throughout the study period at the beginning of  each on-duty shift. This objective test, referred to as the  fitness-for-duty (FIT) workplace screener test, produces a pupilometry  reading that indicates changes in the central nervous system that  result from the influence of fatigue. The tester itself was a  self-contained, tabletop unit that required the test subject to look  into a view port and visually follow a lighted target for  approximately 30 seconds. The test was completely safe and caused no  discomfort to the participant. Each time an officer's pupilometry  reading fell in the top 10 percent of measures (the most tired), he or  she was asked to complete a brief questionnaire designed to gather  additional information to help explain his or her current fatigue  level. Administrative data were also collected from each  participating agency through a review of administrative files,  including personnel files and payroll records. Among the data gathered  were the number of work and leave hours taken by each participating  officer during the study period, the shifts each officer worked, and  the number and type of accidents, complaints, and commendations each officer incurred during the study period."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1, Fatigue Survey Data, includes demographic  data and officers' responses from the initial self-report  survey.
