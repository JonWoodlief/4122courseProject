Respondents were asked how much  attention they had paid to the 2000 presidential race and whether they  intended to vote in the November election. Those queried were asked  for whom they would vote, given a choice among candidates Vice  President Al Gore (Democratic Party), Texas governor George W. Bush  (Republican Party), conservative commentator Pat Buchanan (Reform  Party), and political activist Ralph Nader (Green Party). Their views  were sought on which candidate was best suited to handle the nation's  economy and encourage high moral standards and values, and how Bush  and Gore's selection of former Secretary of Defense and Wyoming  congressman Dick Cheney and Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman as  their respectiv\ne running mates had affected their electoral  decision. A series of questions addressed Lieberman's religion, his  Senate vote to keep late-term/\"partial birth\" abortions legal, his  criticism of President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky  scandal, and his support of a limited test of school vouchers.  Additional topics covered whether Gore was too close to Clinton to  provide a fresh start, whether Bush was too close to his father's  administration to provide a fresh start, and whether the respondent  had negative feelings toward Jews. Background information on  respondents includes age, gender, political party, political  orientation, voter registration and participation history, education, religion, race, and knowledge of location of polling place."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
