Approximately 95% of the two cohort groups answered the questionnaire. The initial freshmen questionnaire consisted of both precoded and open-ended items dealing with high school experience, anticipated college success, interests and values, and relationships with both family and peers.<br /><br />  In the 2nd semester of their freshman year and at the end of their senior year, 450 students from each cohort group, half male and half female, were given a questionnaire which included items about university experience (including satisfaction with course work and living situation); process of decision making; relationships with faculty, family and peers; future expectations (including career goals and marital plans); the issue of career v. family (male and female perspective) and group membership while at the university.\r\n<br /><br />  In addition, 300 new students who were seniors in 1967 were also tested to compensate for attrition of the sample over the four years. Extensive interviews were also administered to 400 students entering as freshmen in 1962 and 1963 (200 from each group), once in the second semester of their freshman year, and once in the second semester of their senior year. Approximately 1,600 participants in all were selected from these various sources to respond to the senior questionnaire.<br\r\n/><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds all numeric file data from the study.
