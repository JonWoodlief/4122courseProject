Empirical research in behavioral   decision-making has revealed that economic prospects are valued in   terms of their departure from a reference point adopted when a decision   is made. Three central questions guided the research: (1) Under what   conditions will a reference point be adopted? (2) How important, in   terms of its overall influence on decision-making, is the reference   point effect likely to be? and (3) What signals or indicators might a   decision-maker look for as cues to the presence and strength of the   effect? Six problems were used in this study. Each problem presented   the possibility of an improvement, at some cost, over the status quo   and asked the subject to indicate the desirability of the improvement   on a seven-point scale. Each problem consisted of a present form and a   past form. In each pair, the past form was the same as the present form   except that additional information was given concerning some earlier   status of the measure in question. Thus, for all problems, the present   form offered an improvement whereas the past form reframed the   improvements as the restoration of a previous loss. Three of the   problem pairs (River Quality, Air Quality, and Auto Emissions) were   realistic in the sense that the extra information included in the past   form was a true statement about previous conditions, a fact known to   the subjects before the experiment started. Three fictional problem   pairs were used to test the hypothesis that the change in reference   position would be largest when subjects had no prior knowledge of the   past status. The fictional problems posed were: Detergent (atmospheric   pollutants released during their manufacture), Public Health (whether a   vaccination program should be instituted to combat an infectious   disease), and Operations (utilizing a better hospital for treating the   infectious disease). The unit of analysis was the volunteer subject  answering the questionnaire."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"environmental attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"environmental hazards"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
