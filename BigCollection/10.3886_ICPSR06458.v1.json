Participation in the survey was   voluntary, with a random sample of individuals drawn from the   population of participating insurance plans with 300 or more FEHBP   enrollees. Results were reported on a total of 265 health plans.   Respondents (and/or family members\n) who had used medical services   during the past 12 months were asked for their opinions on the care   that they received. Part 1, HMO Plan, contains data from respondents   covered under a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan, who were   asked to rate access to care, quality of care from doctors and medical   professionals, choice of primary care doctors available through the   plan, range of services covered, information provided by the plan,   customer service, simplicity of paperwork, and costs. In Part 2,   Fee-for-Service Plan, the questions are similar to those asked in the   HMO questionnaire and also include data on claims processing and   preferred provider networks. Demographic information includes age, sex,  education, income, and family size."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government employees"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health Maintenance Organizations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
