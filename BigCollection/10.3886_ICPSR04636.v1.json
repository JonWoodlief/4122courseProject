A series of questions asked  respondents whether their country was governed by the will of the  people, whether its elections were free and fair, whether they trusted  their government, and whether democracy was the best system of  government. Additional topics addressed crime in the respondent's  community, threats to the environment, the gap between the rich and  the poor, and whether immigration was a good or a bad thing for their  country. Other questions asked whether respondents had done any  volunteer work in the past year, and whether they considered  themselves to be religious.
