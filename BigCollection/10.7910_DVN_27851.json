After baseline survey was taken and farmers were randomized into treatment and control, 20 meetings were set up in order to inform maize and garden egg farmers in the five villages of new loan product that would be distributed conditional on investment in their farms. 169 farmers attended the meetings, of which 91 were maize farmers and 78 were garden egg farmers. Two sets of meetings were in place, 10 that offered a standard loan product and 10 that offered a loan product that had a 50% forgiveness mechanism built in if average crop prices fell below a certain threshold (set at the 10th percentile for historical garden egg prices and the 7th percentile for maize prices). The average loan size for all loans was approximately 238 GHS, or 159 USD. Farmers were not informed of what type of meeting they would attend, and were unaware that there was a difference between the meetings prior to attending.  Outcome measures were types of individuals that are likely to take up the loan under both the control and treatment condit\r\nions, and the impact that the indemnified loan had on investment and profits versus the standard loan."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Finance"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Indemnified loans"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Agriculture"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Risk"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Global Financial Inclusion"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Karlan, D., Kutsoati, E., McMillan, M., and Udry, C., 2011, \"Crop Price Indemnified Loans for Farmers: A Pilot Experiment in Rural Ghana.\" The Journal of Risk and Insurance 78(1): 37-55."},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.1111/j.1539-6975.2010.01406.x"}}]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"USAID/BASIS"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Tisch College of Tufts University"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Innovations for Poverty Action"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-11-19"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-08"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey data, administrative data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"STATA"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"13"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6975.2010.01406.x/abstract"]},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["http://karlan.yale.edu/p/"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Ghana"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Eastern region of Ghana"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individuals"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Maize or garden egg farmers in five villages in Ghana where Mumuadu Rural Bank in the eastern region of Ghana works."]},{"typeName":"dataCollector","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Mumuadu Rural Bank, Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Mumuadu Bank employees contacted key community members (district assemblyman, storekeepers, farmers) in each of five villages to collect the names of all maize and garden egg farmers in the village.
