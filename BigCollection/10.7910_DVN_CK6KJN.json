The local labour system (LLS) provided a specific dimension of this complex approach however it is one of the most adequate possibilities to delineate these areas of commuting. The delimitation process consisted of two steps with the separation of employment centres and with the assignment of settlements to these cores. The alteration of the LLS pattern was also analysed as the investigation was carried out by the census data from 2001 and 2011. The results provided a comprehensive overview about the process of territorial concentration and the instability of peripheral areas. Significant regional disparities of commuting came to light as the consequence of the body of settlement network. The territorial division of the country provided by LLS pattern is fitting to the new and integrated European approach of cities and their hinterlands but it is not alternative against other administrative or statistical divisions of Hungary. However this territorial point of view is in closer relation to the issues of analysing the local labour market processes or the developments targeting the increase in employment."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-04-27"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment, functional urban area, commuting, LLS, settlement network"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Toth, Geza"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-04-27"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Regional Statistics, Vol 5, No 2. 2015: 62–81; DOI: 10.15196/RS05204","label":"RS05204.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":81300,"dataFile":{"id":2805245,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CK6KJN/X8AQLZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CK6KJN/X8AQLZ","filename":"RS05204.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":2600324,"description":"Regional Statistics, Vol 5, No 2. 2015: 62–81; DOI: 10.15196/RS05204","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1545749b375-10f873267977","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6495d75b68f3cde2261cfb53db1a3651","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6495d75b68f3cde2261cfb53db1a3651"}}}]}}}
