SSOCS collects extensive crime and safety data from principals and school administrators of public schools in America. Data from this collection can be used to correlate school characteristics with violent and serious violent crimes in American schools. Furthermore, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what school programs, practices, and policies are used by schools in their efforts to prevent crime. SSOCS has been conducted three times, in school years 1999-2000, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006. The 1999-2000 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2000) was developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and conducted by Abt Associates Inc. Funding for the survey was provided by the Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools. Questionnaire packets were mailed to 3,366 public primary, middle, high, and combined schools. A total of 2,270 public schools submitted usable questionnaires for a weighted response rate of 70 percent.

Six months before the onset of data collection, NCES began working with the school districts of sample schools that required prior approval to participate in the survey. In late February 2004, advance letters were sent to school administrators of sample schools that included the date of the first questionnaire mailing and a toll-free number to call with any questions. Approximately one week later, SSOCS questionnaires were mailed to administrators with a cover letter describing the importance of the survey and a brochure providing additional information about it. On the same day the questionnaires were mailed to schools, letters were sent to sample district superintendents and the Chief State School Officer of each state to inform them that schools within their districts and states, respectively, had been selected to participate in SSOCS:2004. The letters included information about the survey and were accompanied by a copy of the questionnaire and brochure that were sent to schools. The letter was not designed to ask for permission from these officials to participate in the survey but rather was designed by NCES as a vehicle to enhance participation.\nStarting approximately one week after the first questionnaire mailing, follow-up telephone prompts were used to verify that the questionnaire was received and to encourage survey response. As an alternative to replying by mail, data were also accepted by fax submission and over the telephone. Data collection ended on June 4, 2004. Returned questionnaires were examined for quality and completeness using both manual and computerized edits. Out of 227 items on the questionnaire, 101 were identified as key (critical) items. If the survey had more than 40 percent of all items missing or more than 20 percent of critical items missing, the respondent was recontacted to resolve issues related to the missing data. In cases where the recontacts failed to produce a satisfactory resolution, imputation was used to resolve data quality issues for questionnaires that had at least 60 percent of all items and 80 percent of critical items completed. Schools whose questionnaires did not meet the 60/80 criterion and for which recontact was not successful were reclassified as nonrespondents."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime in schools"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime reporting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime statistics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drugs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reactions to crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school attendance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school violence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"student attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"student behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vandalism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victimization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victims"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.

The SASS frame was derived primarily from the 1997-1998 CCD, which includes charter schools. These CCD schools, including charter schools, were included in the SSOCS:2000 study. (The SASS frame also includes a supplement made up of additional charter schools as well as a small number of Bureau of Indian Affairs and Department of Defense schools not represented in the 1997-1998 CCD file.

The use of sampling weights is essential not only for calculating aggregate statistics (e.g., the total number of crimes of a particular type in United States public schools would be greatly understated without the use of weights) but also for other statistics such as percentages. For example, if a particular school policy was less common at elementary schools than at other schools, then the fact that elementary schools were chosen with a lower probability than other schools could lead to\noverstating the percentage of schools with that policy if weights are not used. The FWT (final sample weight) provided with the data file takes into account three components. The essential component of the sampling weight is the “base weight,” which is defined to be the reciprocal of the probability of selecting a school for the sample. In addition, the weight includes a correction for unit nonresponse (i.e., sampled schools that did not respond to the survey) and a poststratification adjustment based on the Public School Universe File of 1998–1999 Common Core of Data. To compensate for unit nonresponse in SSOCS:2000, the base weights were adjusted by applying appropriate nonresponse adjustment factors within groups of schools (cells) expected to be homogeneous in terms of response propensity. The nonresponse adjustment cells were formed by applying a CHAID (Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector) analysis. CHAID is a classification technique that divides a population or sample based on available auxiliary information into homogeneous subgroups with respect to a target characteristic. The target characteristic used in SSOCS:2000 was response status, and the characteristics that were used as auxiliary information were instructional level, enrollment size of school, region, type of locale, minority status, free lunch category, pupil to teacher ratio, district enrollment size, the ratio of guidance counselors to teaching staff in district, and the ratio of graduates to dropouts in district. Based on the CHAID analysis, a total of 49 adjustment cells were formed and the adjustment factors were computed as the ratio of the number of schools sampled to the number of schools responded in each cell. The base weights were multiplied by the computed adjustment factors to derive the nonresponse adjusted weights. A final poststratification (raking ratio) adjustment was applied to the nonresponse adjusted weights. The purpose of the poststratification was to ensure that the estimated counts of schools by various characteristics are in agreement with the known counts obtained from the most recent (1998-1999) CCD file. The counts of schools in the CCD file by instructional level and enrollment size, and by instructional level and type of locale were used in the poststratification adjustment. By forcing the weighted sample counts to agree with known current population counts, poststratification may help reduce any bias associated with the noncoverage of new schools in the SSOCS:2000 sample."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Performed consistency checks."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Unweighted response rate: 68 percent Weighted response rate: 70 percent"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), 2000 [United States]","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35474,"dataFile":{"id":2612853,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), 2000 [United States]","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
