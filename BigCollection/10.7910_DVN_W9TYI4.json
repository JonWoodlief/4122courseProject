This paper determines whether judicial appointments commissions, recently adopted in the UK, have made UK courts more diverse and whether they could increase judicial diversity in other commonwealth countries. I argue that while the appointment of women judges increased in the first year after appointment commissions were established in the UK, any increase in the gender equity of appointments vanished soon thereafter. Had UK-style commissions been implemented in Australia or New Zealand, the number of appointed women might have increased in the first year after the commissions were established, but that increase would not have been sustained in the long-term."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"judicial appointments, judicial selection, judicial appointments commissions, gender equality"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sundeep Iyer"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard University"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sundeep Iyer"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard University"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-10-21"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-10-21"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1998"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data for \"The Fleeting Benefits of Appointments Commissions for Judicial Gender Equity\"","label":"Judicial Appointments Data.csv","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68823,"dataFile":{"id":1584451,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Judicial Appointments Data.csv","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":37198,"description":"Data for \"The Fleeting Benefits of Appointments Commissions for Judicial Gender Equity\"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:61922","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d74f58a37aa95c98d79bae57c7aa8d6d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d74f58a37aa95c98d79bae57c7aa8d6d"}}}]}}}
