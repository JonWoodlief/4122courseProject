The focus of this data collection was the removal of Elian Gonzalez, the six-year-old Cuban boy whose mother drowned when they attempted to immigrate to Florida, from the home of his Miami relatives by federal officers in the early morning hours of Saturday, April 22, 2000. Respondents were asked whet\nher they felt the federal action to remove Elian was appropriate, whether the United States government did all it could to avoid using force in this case, and whether permanent custody of Elian should be granted to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, or to his relatives in Miami. Those queried were asked whether they saw the photograph of a federal agent holding a gun while he was seizing Elian, whether they saw the photograph of Elian smiling after being reunited with his father later the same day, and which of these images struck respondents as more powerful. A series of questions asked respondents whether they approved or disapproved of the handling of the case by Elian's father, Elian's relatives in Miami, Attorney General Janet Reno, President Bill Clinton, Texas governor George W. Bush, Vice President Al Gore, the Cuban-American community in Miami, the Cuban government, and congressional Republicans. A final question addressed whether respondents supported or opposed holding congressional hearings on the government's action to remove Elian from his relatives' home. Background information on respondents includes gender and political party."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child custody"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cuban Americans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gonzalez, Elian"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"immigration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"media coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Reno, Janet"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
