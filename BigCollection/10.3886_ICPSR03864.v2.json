The distinctive contribution of this  study was its exploration at a national level of the intersection of  race and court experience with regard to perceptions of courts.  Previous studies examined this intersection only in cities and  states. This study also sought to answer several related questions:  (1) Do Latinos have distinct views on state courts, or are their views  closely tied to the views of Whites or African Americans? (2) Do  individuals with recent court experience differ from those with more  distant experience in the antecedents and nature of their views? (3)  Does the type of experience (as jurors, litigants, or witnesses)  affect racial groups differently, and does the presumed positive  influence of jury service extend to African Americans and Latinos? (4)  What level of support is there for courts playing nontraditional  roles in cases involving complex emotional and social problems, like  substance abuse and mental illness, and what does this level of  support say about views of the courts as they currently stand? (5) How  much does the media influence views of the courts relative to the  influence of direct experience with courts? (6) What factors make  people willing to return to courts in the future, and do these factors work in a similar way across racial and ethnic groups?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Between March 22, 2000, and May 3, 2000,  interviewers conducted 1,567 telephone interviews with randomly  selected United States residents. The project staff at the National  Center for State Courts designed the survey instrument and revised it  based on a review by the advisory committee members and\nstaff from the  Indiana University Public Opinion Laboratory (IUPOL). Pretests were  used to refine the survey instrument. The final instrument contained  two sets of questions. The first set of questions was directed at all  respondents. The second set of questions was directed only at those  respondents with court experience in the last 12 months. A translator  under contract to the IUPOL prepared a Spanish version of the survey  instrument. The translation was reviewed and revised by two certified  Spanish court interpreters. The interviews were conducted by  professional interviewers at the IUPOL from special facilities on the  Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis campus. All  interviewers received at least four hours of general training in  addition to specific training for this project.
