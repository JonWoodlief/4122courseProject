The questionnaire was designed to collect information about their personal background, college experiences, and subsequent marital, educational and employment histories.\r\n<br /><br />  The survey was sent to over 13,000 women who had attended the college as undergraduates and graduate students from the classes of 1900 to 1975. Over 6,000 women completed and returned the questionnaire, representing a response rate of 48%. For individual classes response rates ranged from 29% to 76%. Most respondents had started attending Radcliffe as first year students and continued through their senior year. Others had only received part of their college education at Radcliffe.\r\nThe sample is 85% white. Ages range from their early 20s to 100, with the greatest percentage in their 30s or 40s.\r\n<br /><br />  The survey is divided into two parts, sent in the same mailing. Topics covered in part one include: paid and volunteer work during adulthood; salary; educational history; accomplishments and distinctive titles and awards earned; career counselling received; current involvement with Radcliffe alumnae and activities; if married, husband's education, work, and salary. Part two includes questions about: undergraduate experiences at and satisfaction with Radcliffe; family background and\r\nexpectations about education; marital history and children; career history, including interruptions in work and detailed history of positions held. The survey also solicits the women's attitudes a\r\nbout women and education, volunteer work and paid jobs.<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (original record paper data from part two of the survey questionnaire for 700 participants, most of whom were graduate students).
