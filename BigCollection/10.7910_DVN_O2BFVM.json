In this paper, BPR is aimed by achieving dramatic improvements on the available business\r\npro-cesses of a company in private sector by using simulation technique. Several performance measures have\r\nbeen defined in order to be able to monitor the system performance. Major ones of those are the percent of\r\nresponding demands, and the lead time, which is the time between the placement and receiving of the order. The\r\ndemand change is known as the fundamental problem of the system by the company. After the assessments made,\r\nit has been seen that the demand change, contrary to the assumptions made, does not have significant effect on\r\nthe system performance.
