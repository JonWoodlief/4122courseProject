Documentation is available for download with this collection.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Occasionally, response categories used in the ACS data files change, which may cause a multi-year PUMS file to carry two or more variables to replace the original single variable seen in the 1-year PUMS. This happens because of changes in the classification systems used for analysis of the economy as well as changes in the detailed race, ancestry, place of birth codes and definitions of Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). This 2008-2012 5-year PUMS file has sixteen sets of dual (or triple) variables (also described as vintage variables) since many detailed variables were revised for the 2012 data products. In order to obtain data for the entire PUMS sample, all of these vintages must be used for a given variable. A value of -9, -09, -009, or -0009 (depending on the variable's length) is assigned to cases for which the variable is not applicable due to the data year, except for occupation codes. For a complete list of the dual variable, see the ReadMe document for the 2008-2012 5-year PUMS and the PUMS Data Dictionary included with this data collection for more information on these variables.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The smallest geographic unit that is identified is the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA), which is based on a population size of initially around 100,000 or more. There are two sets of PUMAs on the 2008-2012 ACS PUMS. PUMS records from 2008 through 2011 have PUMA codes which were created from the 2000 Census 5 percent PUMS data files. PUMS records from 2012 have PUMA codes based on the 2010 Census data. The older records do not have the 2010 PUMA codes, and the 2012 records do not have the 2000-based 5 percent PUMA codes.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Due to the limit in the number of
