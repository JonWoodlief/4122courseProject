Normally we donâ€™t know\r\nhow power we are using the daily and how much price it is up to month ending. But in this project we can know\r\nhow power we are using every day or every hour. So we can reduce the usage of power by switch off the loads\r\nused in the homes or industry. In this project the energy meter sends the data for every day or every one hour by\r\nusing the RTC, so we can control the usage of the power by switch off loads. In this project user can control\r\nloads with mobile through the Wi-Fi communications and web based things. Here we can observe the daily\r\nusage of the power and price by using the RTC, if the electricity load was high we switch off the unnecessary\r\nloads in the home and we can control any load with the internet of things and we can operate remotely. In this\r\nproject we can see the every hour the usage of the power and price for that power , the usage of the sends to the\r\nPC through the wifi technology and the if the power usage was high we can switch off the lights by sending the\r\nmessage the to the controller through GSM technology."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"IJRISE, IJRISE Journal"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-10-15"}]}},"files":[{"label":"16October1.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88149,"dataFile":{"id":2903538,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/TVARP5/GDVSNN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TVARP5/GDVSNN","filename":"16October1.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":485527,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:157cb8ab6b9-95ad8a61c42c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"8000028283645916cf8a97b118d021cd","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"8000028283645916cf8a97b118d021cd"}}}]}}}
