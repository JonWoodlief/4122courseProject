It   investigates the role of consequential organizational actors, both   public and private, who contributed to the national debate and   influenced decision-making in these domains. Organizations   participating in this survey included congressional committees and   subcommittees, federal agencies, associations of state and local   governments, research units, labor unions, trade associations,   professional societies, corporations, and public interest groups. The   principal investigators interviewed individuals who had responsibility   for managing the efforts of their organization in attempting to   influence national policy-making. Respondents were asked to evaluate   the role of their organization in 85 specific events related to energy   policy and 85 events related to health policy over the decade of the   1970s. These events revolved around national health areas such as   biomedical issues (e.g., NIH funding, DNA research, human   experimentation, targeted-disease funding), manpower issues (nurse   training, physician training, foreign medical graduates, third-year   medical school transfers), the organization and delivery of care (cost   containment, HMOs, health planning, community health services, rural   health care, Professional Standards Review Organizations), and drug   regulation (saccharin, new drug development, generic equivalents of   brand-name drugs, safety brochure inserts, cyclamates). The energy   domain included events in the following areas: energy research issues   (geothermal energy, electric-powered automobiles, breeder reactors,   nuclear wastes), energy industry development issues (Trans-Alaska Oil   Pipeline, uranium enrichment, synthetic fuels, oil from shale rock),   energy regulatory issues (price controls on domestic oil and natural   gas, nuclear accident insurance, National Energy Plan, natural gas   deregulation, Three Mile Island, nuclear power plant construction), and   energy consumption issues (55-mile-per-hour speed limit, energy taxes,   air pollution standards, automobile fuel efficiency standards).   Respondents were queried about the main activities and functions of   their organizations, areas of interest in national policy-making,   interactions with other organizations, and levels of knowledge and  involvement in the formulation of such policies."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR VIII.B.1.
