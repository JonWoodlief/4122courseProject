A number of clients’ questions are combined into one questionnaire. This questionnaire is usually administered to probability sample of about 2 200 respondents in the whole country (South Africa). The 1996 February omnibus consisted of two separate samples of 2 200 each – one sample having a yellow questionnaire and the other sample having a pink questionnaire. The February/March 1996 omnibus survey was undertaken over the period 27 February to 24 March 1995. The data from this survey was available in May 1996. The fieldwork was done on a countrywide basis including all nine provinces. Interviewers specifically trained in personal interviewing collected the data. The respondents were scientifically selected, and interviewed at home. The interviews were conducted after hours to ensure that the scientifically drawn person was present. If the drawn person was not home during the first visit, but was available during the fieldwork period, an appointment was made and the person concerned revisited. If nobody in the household qualified, or was available during the fieldwork period, the household was substituted. The questions in the questionnaire were printed in both English and Afrikaans. During training these were translated into he relevant languages of the Black fieldwork areas. Interviews were conducted in the respondent’s choice of language. The respondent also had to be part of the scientifically drawn household, and be available during the fieldwork period. Substitution of the visiting point was only allowed for specified reasons."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Indicators - International"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Africa - South Africa"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: of the Archive), within the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (\"Data-PASS\") in accordance with the Data-PASS terms (the \"Terms\") of use (available from: http://www.icpsr.org/Da\nta-PASS).
