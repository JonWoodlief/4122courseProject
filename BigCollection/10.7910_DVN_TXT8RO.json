This file\r\ncontains replication data for the third essay.\r\n\r\nThe third essay argues that to understand when voters hold politicians\r\naccountable for corruption, it is necessary to understand who they perceive\r\nto be corrupt. It presents evidence from a survey experiment showing that\r\nAmerican voters perceive copartisan politicians to be less corrupt than\r\nthose from the other political party or without a party label. This pattern\r\nis consistent with motivated reasoning in which voters expend extra\r\ncognitive resources to process information that contradicts their partisan\r\nleanings rather than from the use of party labels as heuristics to avoid\r\ncognitive burdens. Furthermore, I show that the ideological orientation of\r\nthe media source reporting allegations of corruption affects whether they\r\nare viewed as credible. Counterstereotypical allegations – i.e., those that\r\ncome from a media source that is ideologically similar to the politician –\r\nare taken more seriously by respondents. In fact, when partisans view\r\ncounterstereotypical allegations, they exhibit less bias toward\r\ncopartisans. In sum, this research demonstrates that in-group favoritism\r\nposes a challenge to democratic accountability, but that motivated\r\nreasoning is bounded by the evidence voters view, and thus that media\r\nsources with well-known ideological orientations may serve a particularly\r\nimportant role in encouraging democratic accountability among their bases."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Faller, Julie "},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-04-30"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Faller_corruption_replication.txt","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":69584,"dataFile":{"id":2671909,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/TXT8RO/FNGWKN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TXT8RO/FNGWKN","filename":"Faller_corruption_replication.txt","contentType":"text/plain","filesize":157020,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14d24495935-5d0593829e02","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a3f4df302688329e9f044119f28d6576","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a3f4df302688329e9f044119f28d6576"}}},{"label":"Faller_corruption_survey.docx","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":69584,"dataFile":{"id":2671910,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/TXT8RO/UQCVV2","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TXT8RO/UQCVV2","filename":"Faller_corruption_survey.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":16883,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14d2449bfab-14e18378cb58","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2fb9d4287b5cd4efbfbc6976727835c8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2fb9d4287b5cd4efbfbc6976727835c8"}}}]}}}
