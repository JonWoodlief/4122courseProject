Conducted in  Boston, the survey was designed to examine how adults manage tasks in  three domains of life -- work, family, and health. Further goals were  to describe the subjective experience of goal attainment in midlife  and to link it with objective measures of short-term longitudinal  changes and cognitive functioning. During the national study, the  Boston area was intentionally oversampled in order to create a subset  to be used for in-depth study of management processes in midlife. The  Boston study began six months after the national study, and consisted  of three interviews: a 30-minute phone interview followed by a  20-minute mail questionnaire (Time 1), a 90-minute in-person  combination of cognitive tests, cortisol testing, photograph taking,  and interview (Time 2), and a 30-minute phone interview (Time 3),  conducted at six-month intervals. The focus was on projects related to  family, work, and health that participants were working on during the  period of the study. Each successive interview investigated  participants' assessments of their progress in the present,  recollection of six months in the past, and prediction six months into  the future. At Time 1, participants generated a list of two important  family, work, and health tasks, then chose one of each as the most  important in that domain. For each of the most important tasks,  questions were asked about deadlines, whether participants were doing  tasks because they had to do them, felt that they should do them, or  chose to do them, and whether participants were doing tasks for  themselves, others, or both. All six projects were ranked according to  importance, and participants divided all their time into percentages  spent on family, work, and health. The majority of questions on the  mail questionnaire at Time 1 were taken from the Midlife Development  Inventory (MIDI), the instrument created for the national  study. Respondents were asked to rate their control over health, to  make assessments about present, past, and future health, to list any  serious illnesses, and to indicate their physical health status. Study  participants also rated their mental health, and discussed stressful  life events in the last six months for self, spouse/significant other,  parents, and children. Other questions focused on depression, mastery  and constraints, community involvement, family, work, and life  satisfaction. Scales used included the Ryff Well-Being Scales, the  Eysenck Personality Inventory, the Staudinger and Baltes Wisdom Scale  (1995), and the Ways of Coping Scale. Time 2 was done in-person, and  included a 50-minute series of cognitive tests followed by a 40-minute  interview.\nThe cognitive testing consisted of nine measures of  cognitive ability completed in the following order: WAIS Forward Digit  Span, WAIS Backward Digit Span, WAIS Vocabulary, counting backwards  test, letter comparison test, dual-task test involving the counting  backwards and letter comparison tests, WAIS Digit Symbol,  Schaie-Thurston Letter Series, and Raven's Advanced Progressive  Matrices. The Time 2 interview began with a series of questions asking  about each of the family, work, and health tasks elicited from the  participants in Time 1. Many questions were repeated from the MIDI  including rating physical health, family life, work situation, and  life overall, rating physical and mental health from poor to  excellent, and a measure of stressful life events in the last six  months for self, spouse/significant other, parents, and  children. Participants were asked to rate how old they felt and how  old they looked and to indicate their total yearly household  income. Lastly, a series of open-ended questions asked about best and  worst aspects of family, work, and health, how participants managed  their daily life, the most challenging aspect of life and how it was  managed, and what participants found most helpful in carrying out  their daily life. Photographs were taken of participants at the  conclusion of the interview. Time 3 asked again about each of the most  important family, work, and health tasks elicited from the  participants in Time 1. Newly developed questions asked participants  about ideas related to middle age, including when the participant  believed middle age begins and ends, whether the participant was  younger than, in, or older than middle age, the biggest changes in  middle age, the best and worst aspects of middle age, whether the  participant knew anyone who had had a \"midlife crisis,\" and whether he  or she would have or had had a midlife crisis. Participants were asked  to rate how often they had problems and how often things went well  with respect to a list of 26 domains, and how much stress and how much  control they had in these domains. Lastly, participants were asked  whether they had ever returned to a degree-oriented educational  program after being out of school for five or more years, whether they  were presently taking classes to further their education, and whether  being a participant in the study had influenced the ways they thought about their family, work, and health projects."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cognitive functioning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"coping"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"goals"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life events"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"midlife"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"psychological wellbeing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"time utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FENWAY VI.
