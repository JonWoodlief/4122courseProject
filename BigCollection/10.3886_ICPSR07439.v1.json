Core data are collected annually, with each new wave of family data constituting a separate data file (Parts 2-27, 201-205). Data on individuals are contained in Part 1, Cross-Year Individual File, 1968-1993 (Waves 1-26) [Public Release II], and an early release of individual-level data through 1999 is included in Part 201, Cross-Year Individual File, 1968-1999 (Waves 1-31) [Public Release I]. The PSID has continued to trace individuals from the original national sample of approximately 4,800 households, whether those individuals are living in the same dwelling or with the same people. The investigators hoped to discover whether most short-term changes in economic status are due to forces outside the family or if they can be traced to something in the individual's own background or in the pattern of his or her thinking and behavior. The data can shed light on what causes family income to rise above or fall below the poverty line. In line with the theoretical model, the questions asked fall generally under the headings of economic status, economic behavior, demographics, and attitudes. Specifically, they deal with topics such as employment, income sources and amounts, housing, car ownership, food expenditures, transportation, do-it-yourself home maintenance and car repairs, education, disability, time use, family background, family composition changes, and residential location. Content of a more sociological or psyc\nhological nature is also included in some waves of the study. Information gathered in the survey applies to the circumstances of the family unit as a whole (e.g., type of housing) or to particular persons in the family unit (e.g., age, earnings). While some information is collected about all individuals in the family unit, the greatest level of detail is ascertained for the primary adults heading the family unit. Core topics in the PSID include income sources and amounts, poverty status, public assistance in the form of food or housing, other financial matters (e.g., taxes, inter-household transfers), family structure and demographic measures (e.g., marital events, birth and adoptions, children forming households), labor market participation (e.g., employment status, vacation/sick time, occupation, industry, work experience), housing (e.g., own/rent, house value/rent payment, size), geographic mobility (e.g., when and why moved, where head of household grew up, all states head of household lived in), and socioeconomic background (e.g., education, ethnicity, religion, military service, parents' education, occupation, poverty status). Beginning in 1985, comprehensive retrospective fertility and marriage histories of individuals in the households were assembled."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fertility"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food aid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marriage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population trends"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"poverty"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social indicators"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"socioeconomic status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.

Corresponding SAS and  SPSS data definition statements and PDF codebooks have been added for  each file. The \"original\" PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS (PSID) (ICPSR  7439) has been broken out by ICPSR into three separate data  collections: PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS, 1968-1999: ANNUAL CORE  DATA (ICPSR 7439), PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS, 1968-1999:  SUPPLEMENTAL FILES (ICPSR 3202), and PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS,  1989-1990: LATINO SAMPLE (ICPSR 3203). This collection, PANEL STUDY  OF INCOME DYNAMICS, 1968-1999: ANNUAL CORE DATA (ICPSR 7439), now contains only the cross-year individual files and family files.;Version Date: 1997-02-24Version Text: 1997-02-24 Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: (1) Part 1, Cross-Year Individual File, 1968-1992  (Waves I-XXV), and its codebook and SAS and SPSS data definition  statements were reissued and are current as of October 1996. The most  significant changes are to V32015 (MARITAL STATUS OF MOTHER AT TIME OF  INDIVIDUAL'S BIRTH). Minor changes were also made in that file to  variables derived from Part 68, Childbirth and Adoption History File,  1985-1992 (Waves XVIII-XXV) (V32009-V32014 and V32016-V32032). Also in  Part 1, variable V32700 (RELEASE NUMBER) was added and has a value of  \"003\" for all records. (2) Part 68, Childbirth and Adoption History  File, 1985-1992 (Waves XVIII-XXV), as well as its WordPerfect 5.1  codebook and SAS and SPSS data definition statements, were reissued  and are current as of August 1996. The most significant changes to  Part 68 are to V7 (MARITAL STATUS OF MOTHER AT TIME OF INDIVIDUAL'S  BIRTH). The codebook for Part 68 is also available in hardcopy form  upon request from ICPSR. (3) Part 49, Family File, 1991 (Wave XXIV),  and its codebook and SAS and SPSS data definition statements were  reissued and are current as of July 1996. In that data file, values  for V20243 (1991 CORE FAMILY WEIGHT) and V20244 (1991 LATINO FAM  WEIGHT) were recomputed--the changes affect 282 core families and 290  Latino families. V20245 (COMBINED FAM WEIGHT) is not affected. Also in  Part 49, the values for V19001 (RELEASE NUMBER) were changed to  \"003\". In addition, the questionnaire for Part 49 is now available  as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. (4) An errata sheet for the  PSID CD-ROM (CD0011) details the above-mentioned chan\nges to these  files. This sheet is available through the ICPSR Website and in  hardcopy form upon request from ICPSR. (5) New data files with  corresponding codebooks and SAS and SPSS data definition statements  were also added: Part 76, Family Wealth Supplement Data, 1984 (Wave  XVII), Part 77, Family Wealth Supplement Data, 1989 (Wave XXII), Part  78, Family Wealth Supplement Data, 1994 (Wave XXVII), Part 201,  Cross-Year Individual File, 1968-1995 (Waves I-XXVIII) [Early  Release], Part 202, Family File, 1993 (Wave XXVI) [Early Release],  Part 203, Family File, 1994 (Wave XXVII) [Early Release], and Part  204, Family File, 1995 (Wave XXVIII) [Early Release]. The  questionnaires for Parts 203 and 204 are PDF files, while the  documentation for Parts 202-204 are in ASCII format. An ASCII version  of the questionnaire for Part 202 is available for downloading from  the PSID website, and a PDF file of that questionnaire is being  created by the PSID staff. (5) The early release files (Parts 201-204)  are preliminary and should be ordered by experienced PSID users  only. Documentation for these files are incomplete, and PSID staff  will offer virtually no assistance with their use. ICPSR can offer  only technical assistance in reading the files, and can provide no  substantive advice on their use. These files will be replaced with the  final version of the data and codebook when it has been completed. All  but the most experienced users are asked to wait until that time to  order the data. (6) Users are encouraged to check the PSID homepage at  www.umich.edu/~psid/ for updates. (7) Users should note that the  wealth variables previously released in Part 35, Family File, 1984  (Wave XVII), and Part 45, Family File, 1989 (Wave XXII) will not, in  general (on a case-by-case basis), match the values released in Parts  76-77, the family wealth supplement data for 1984 and 1989, due to the  implementation of a new missing data imputation technique. (8) The  questionnaire for Part 70, Self-Administered Questionnaire  Supplemental File, 1990 (Wave XXIII), is now available and is in  WordPerfect 7.0 format. In addition, the data file for Part 70 has  been replaced. The previous version contained null characters. (9)  The codebook for Part 72, Telephone Health Care Cost Questionnaire  Supplemental File, is now available, and the codebook for Part 74,  Parent Health Supplement, 1991 (Wave XXIV), has been replaced. (10)  The following files previously contained \"high\" ASCII characters.  These characters have been converted to US ASCII to enable all users  to read the files: Codebooks for Parts 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19,  21, 23, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 51, 55, 58, and 64, the SPSS  data definition statements for Part 11, and the SAS data definition statements for Parts 12, 62, 70, and 72.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: LRECL with SAS, SPSS, and Stata setup files, SAS transport file, and SPSS portable file;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The \"original\" PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS (PSID) (ICPSR 7439) has been broken out by ICPSR into\nthree separate data collections: PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS, 1968-1999: ANNUAL CORE DATA (ICPSR 7439), PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS, 1968-1999: SUPPLEMENTAL FILES (ICPSR 3202), and PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS, 1989-1990: LATINO SAMPLE (ICPSR 3203).
