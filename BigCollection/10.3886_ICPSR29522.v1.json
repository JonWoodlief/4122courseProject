The project's primary goal was to produce promising practices that will help law enforcement and public health agencies improve interagency coordination related to terrorist threats, as well as other public health emergencies. Phase I of this study used the Surveillance System Inventory (SSI). The SSI is a database that documents and describes public health and public safety surveillance systems in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland.

The main purpose of this study was to identify promising practices used in other countries to solve the coordination problem and then recommend a set of preferred practices for use in the United States. To achieve this goal, it was necessary to first demonstrate that the coordination problem, as theoretically defined in the social choice literature, existed in the United States and other countries. Second, successes and failures in resolving the coordination problem in each of the four countries were examined. Finally, the experiences from the four countries to identify promising practices for solving the coordination problem were used. International considerations, sensitive research topics, and national security concerns added to the complexity of this research. As a result, the design employed was exploratory and not definitive.</p>\n<p>The SSI, was designed as a critical case to evaluate the level of coordination in a narrowly defined and fairly well-established area of a routine procedure used by both public health and law enforcement. This design was based on the assumption that interagency coordination would most likely be found in an area that was established for both types of agencies and that had the potential to improve our understanding of the nature of the terrorist threat and to develop response plans through a data-driven approach. For this reason, the level and type of coordination between public health and law enforcement agencies was examined on all federally funded public health and public safety surveillance systems, which served as valuable tools for planning, detecting, and responding to population-based health hazards and criminal\nactivity. Understanding the range of surveillance systems in these two categories across the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland will advance interagency coordination in the United States by demonstrating common goals and identifying resources that can be shared. In addition to addressing the coordination issue, the SSI served as a descriptive repository for coordination-related data on public health and public safety surveillance systems.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the SSI was designed to:</p>\n<p><ul>\n<li>attempt to provide a comprehensive list of all publicly funded public health and public safety surveillance systems that could be applied for terrorism planning, detection, and response</li>\n<li>provide a set of existing surveillance systems that have relevance to stakeholders</li>\n<li>serve as a point of reference and information for the stakeholder interviews</li>\n</ul></p>\n<p>Systems were identified through searches of published literature and the Internet. The published literature searches included relevant peer-reviewed articles, government reports, system documents and manuals, and other relevant documents. The Internet searches examined both government and private Web sites for surveillance information. These searches were iterative, with follow-up searches based on information gained during the initial search, such as document citations and references.</p>\n<p>Internet searches used the Google general search engine. Initial searches used a general keyword search. This information was augmented with targeted searches of both government agency Web sites and nongovernmental sites. The government search used the full range of agencies likely to fund, develop, or use public health or public safety surveillance systems.</p>\n<p>The project staff used published materials found during the search activities to code both basic and detailed information on each of the surveillance systems. Basic data elements were captured during the system identification stage. Project staff extracted detailed data elements during subsequent reviews of the information identified in the literature and Internet searches. The data elements were keyed into a data capture form and stored in an Access database.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The study contains a total 131 variables.
