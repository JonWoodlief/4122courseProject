<a href=\"http://healthit.hhs.gov/\">onchit</a> a close second.<br /> <br /> annual brfss data sets have grown rapidly over the past half-decade: the 1984 data set contained only\n12,258 respondents from 15 states, all  states were participating by 1994, and the 2011 file has surpassed half a million interviews. if you're examining trends over time, do your homework  and review the\n<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/technical_infodata/surveydata.htm\">brfss technical documents</a> for the years you're looking at (plus any years in between). what might you find? well for starters, the cdc switched to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/surveillancepractice/reports/brfss/brfss.html\">sampling cellphones in their 2011 methodology</a>.<br /> <br /> unlike many u.s. government surveys, brfss is not conducted for each resident at a sampled household (phone number). only one respondent per\nphone number gets interviewed. did i miss anything? well if your next question is frequently asked,\n<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/faqs.htm\">you're in luck</a>.<br /> <br /> all brfss files are available in sas transport format so if you're sittin' pretty on 16 gb of ram, you could potentially <a href=\"http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/foreign/html/read.xport.html\">read.xport</a> a single year and create a <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/survey/html/svydesign.html\">taylor-series survey object</a> using <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/survey/\">the sur\nvey package</a>. cool. but hear me out: the download and importation script builds an ultra-fast monet database (click here for <a href=\"http://www.asdfree.com/2013/03/column-store-r-or-how-i-learned-to-stop.html\">speed tests, installation instructions</a>) on your local hard drive. after that, these scripts are shovel-ready. consider importing all brfss files my way - let it run overnight - and during your actual analyses, code will run a lot faster. the brfss generalizes to the u.s. adult (18+\n) (non-institutionalized) population, but if you don't have a phone, you're probably out of scope. this new github repository contains four scripts:\n<br /> <br /> <b>1984 -
