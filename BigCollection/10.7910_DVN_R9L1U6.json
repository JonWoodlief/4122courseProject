The first one was administered in 1928, in honor of Radcliffe's semi-centennial, and was designed to provide an overall profile of Radcliffe alumnae, with special attention paid to political involvement. The 1944 survey served to gather similar information, with a further emphasis on the quality of the education received at Radcliffe. The results of this questionnaire were used by the University Committee on the Objectives of General Education in a Free Society to evaluate the liberal education offered by Radcliffe and to explore college education of women.\r\n<br /><br />  The samples for both surveys consisted of women who had attended Radcliffe from its beginning in 1879 up through the time of the survey. The 1928 survey, a self-administered questionnaire, was sent to all alumnae, including women who had attended Radcliffe only temporarily. Responses were received from approximately 3,300 alumnae. The 1944 survey was sent to a random sample of 1,000 alumnae out of the 5,549 Radcliffe A.B. recipients. Responses were received from 482 women.<br /><br\r\n/>  Both questionnaires included items regarding careers, marriage and motherhood. Specific items dealt with the reasons for deciding to attend Radcliffe, an evaluation of the education received, educational and employment history, family and marital status, and attitudes toward combining motherhood and a career. The 1928 survey also included extensive questions regarding volunteer and political work. The 1944 survey emphasized education and satisfaction with Radcliffe. Some of the 1944 surveys were accompanied by an additional shorter questionnaire designed to evaluate the tutorial system; these were completed and returned by 200 women.\r\n<br /><br />  The original questionnaires are stored at the Radcliffe College archives; access to these records is possible."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mra"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"over 1000"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sampsize"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"female"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gender"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mixed"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Age"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"White"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Race"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"middle"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SES"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Generations"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu/vocabulary"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"General education"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LCSH"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://authorities.loc.gov/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Murray Research Archive"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.murray.harvard.edu"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/logos/10/mra_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1989"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1920"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1950"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1928"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1944"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["individuals"]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quota sample"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"questionnaire"}]},"customMRA":{"displayName":"MRA Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"mraCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Education","Family.
