That is, the intent was to secure a sample with a mean age of roughly 16 years in each country. From this roster, one, two, or three classrooms were randomly selected within each designated school, based on school size. Rather than pull out the 16-year-olds for survey, all youths in the designated classrooms were recruited for assessment during a regular classroom session. The result was an approximate self-weighted sample, with a mean age of 16 years and with an age range reflecting the inclusion of younger and older youths within these classrooms. In several countries, especially within smaller schools, 16-year-olds are grouped in classrooms with youths as young as 10 years and as old as young adults, and the sample reflects these educational practices.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self-enumerated questionnaire"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>There are no weight variables in this data collection.
