Respondents were also asked to give their opinions on how President George W. Bush and his administration were handling the following: the war on terrorism, Social Security, the economy, health care, prescription drug benefits, and the war with Iraq. They were asked whether these issues affected their voting selections and if so, in what way. Opinions of President George W.

In addition, respondents asked about what the priorities of the nation should be, the current state of the national economy, and their personal financial situation.
