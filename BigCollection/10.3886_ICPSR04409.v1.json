Two projects funded  by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) evaluated these Milwaukee  domestic violence experiments. The first project examined the  effectiveness of a specialized domestic violence court that opened in  September 1994. The primary intent of the specialized domestic  violence court was to speed up the disposition of cases. The second  project examined the impact of a change in the district attorney's  (DA's) screening policy that admitted more cases into the special  court, which became effective January 1, 1995. The liberalized  prosecutorial policy was intended to determine whether arrests that  the DA normally rejected for prosecution because victims failed to  attend the prosecutor's charging conference could be prosecuted  successfully none the less. The researchers collected data from three  time periods: (1) prior to September 1994, (2) between September 1994  and January 1995, and (3) post-Janurary 1995. For the first  experiment, several samples were selected from court and DA records to  assess the impact of the introduction of the special domestic violence  court and its impact after the change in the DA's charging policy.  These samples of domestic violence cases (court samples) filed by the  prosecutor included: (1) 237 cases from Summer 1994, (2) 190 cases  from Fall 1994, and (3) 242 cases from Spring 1995. For the second  experiment, three additional samples (complaint room samples) were  collected of domestic cases declined by the prosecutor to determine  how victim attendance at the charging conference and other factors  affected the decision to prosecute: (1) 152 cases from Summer 1994,  (2) 155 cases from Fall 1994, and (3) 152 cases from Spring 1995.  Variables in this dataset include if the case was filed, type of  charges, number of prior misdemeanors, number of prior felonies,  number of misdemeanors after, number of felonies after, number of  felony convictions, number of misdemeanor convictions, number of  subpoenas, number of judicial body attachment orders, whether the  victim was cooperative, if the victim testified, method of  disposition, type of disposition, time to disposition, time to  sentencing, sentencing conditions, if the defendant received jail or  prison time, if the defendant received probation time, number of  months incarcerated, number of months on probation, and several date  variables.

Official statistics indicate that, immediately after the statute was  enacted, as many as 90 percent of domestic violence misdemeanor  arrests in Milwaukee were not charged by the district attorney's  (DA's) office. By mid-1994 the DA realized that Milwaukee was  prosecuting a smaller proportion of domestic arrests than other  Wisconsin cities. Officials in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, introduced two  experiments designed to provide answers to questions of how to deal  with victim reluctance in domestic violence cases. Two projects funded  by the National Institute of Ju\nstice evaluated these Milwaukee  domestic violence experiments. The first project examined the  effectiveness of a specialized domestic violence court that opened in  September 1994. The primary intent of the specialized domestic  violence court was to speed up the disposition of cases in order to:  (1) reduce backlogs, (2) reduce the amount of time the victim had to  change her mind about prosecution, thereby increasing convictions, and  (3) reduce opportunities for pretrial violence. The second project  examined the impact of a change in the DA's screening policy that  admitted more cases into the special court, which became effective  January 1, 1995. The liberalized prosecutorial policy was intended to  determine whether arrests which the DA normally rejected for  prosecution because victims failed to attend the prosecutor's charging  conference could be prosecuted successfully nonetheless. To do this,  the DA's office jettisoned the requirement that victims come to the  complaint room, resulting in a doubling of the number of domestic  arrests filed with the court. The second experiment focused on  evaluating if it was in the interests of victims and in the interest  of justice to open the intake gates wide and prosecute cases previously thought not winnable."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The researchers collected data from three time  periods: (1) prior to September 1994, which marked the start of the  special domestic violence court, (2) between September 1994 and  January 1995, the period after the special court began and before the  change in the district attorney's charging policy, and (3)  post-January 1995, after the change in the district attorney's  charging policy.
