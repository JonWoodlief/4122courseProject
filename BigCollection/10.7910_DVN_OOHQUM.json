Drawing on theories of electoral choice and on socio-psychological literature largely ignored by scholars of electoral behaviour, it suggests and tests a number of competing hypotheses. The findings demonstrate that while religiosity has few direct effects, and while religious people are neither more nor less hostile towards ethnic minorities and thereby neither m\nore nor less prone to vote for a radical right party, they are not ‘available’ to these parties because they are still firmly attached to Christian Democratic or conservative parties. However, given increasing de-alignment, this ‘vaccine effect’ is likely to become weaker with time."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"extreme right,radical right, religiosity, western europe"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behaviour"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Social Survey"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ESS"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002"},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-01-19"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["imputed survey data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"3.12"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"3.12"}}]},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["European Social Survey"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Denkmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Western Europe"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["country"]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["West European Voters"]},{"typeName":"timeMethod","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cross-sectional"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Estimate the model separately for protestants&non-believers/catholics&non-believers (CH/NL).
