Proponents argue that microcredit mitigates market failures, spurs micro-enterprise growth, and boosts borrowers’ well-being. We tested these hypotheses with the use of an innovative, replicable experimental design that randomly assigned individual liability microloans (of $225 on average) to 1601 individuals in the Philippines through credit scoring. After 11 to 22 months, we found evidence consistent with unmet demand at the current price (a roughly 60% annualized interest rate): Net borrowing increased in the treatment group relative to controls. However, the number of business activities and employees in the treatment group decreased relative to controls, and subjective well-being declined slightly. We also found little evidence that treatment effects were more pronounced for women. However, we did find that microloans increase ability to cope with risk, strengthen community ties, and increase access to informal credit. Thus, microcredit here may work, but through channels different from those often hypothesized by its proponents."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Microcredit"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Microfinance"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Microloans"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Individual liability"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Credit scoring"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Entrepreneurship"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Small business"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English","Tagalog"]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"National Science Foundation"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"USAID"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Research Support, Innovations for Poverty Action"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-02-16"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2006-02-10"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-11-16"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Administrative data","Survey data"]},{"typeName":"software","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"softwareName":{"typeName":"softwareName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Stata"},"softwareVersion":{"typeName":"softwareVersion","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"12"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6035/1278"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Philippines"}},{"state":{"typeName":"state","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Rizal"}},{"state":{"typeName":"state","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cavitc"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Northern Capital Region"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Individual"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Marginally creditworthy applicants to First Macro Bank (FMB)"]},{"typeName":"dataCollector","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"First Macro Bank, Survey firm (unspecified)"},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Our sample frame and treatment assignments were created in the flow of the lender’s three-step credit-scoring process.

Second, loan officers entered household and business information on these 2158 applicants into the credit-scoring software, and the software then rendered its application disposition within seconds. Of this group, 391 applications received scores in the automatic approval range, And 166 applications received scores in the automatic rejection range. The remaining 1601 applicants had scores in one of the two randomization windows (approve with 60% or 85% probability), and this group constituted our sample frame. Of these 1601 marginal applicants, 1272 were assigned “approve\" and 329 applicants were assigned “reject” by the software, which simply instructed loan officers to approve or reject; that is, it did not display the application score or make any mention of the randomization. Neither loan officers, branch managers, nor applicants were informed about the credit-scoring algorithm or its random component."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Administrative data collection, in-person interviews"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Follow-up surveys used in the study.","label":"CreditScoring_Followup_Survey.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":85867,"categories":["Surveys"],"dataFile":{"id":2804126,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/VOTBOK/FBXNZB","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VOTBOK/FBXNZB","filename":"CreditScoring_Followup_Survey.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1388320,"description":"Follow-up surveys used in the study.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15435650536-d1b80d85bca7","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"11ad3697dd7346659dadacbecce13f47","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"11ad3697dd7346659dadacbecce13f47"}}},{"description":"The codebook that accompanies the main dataset.
