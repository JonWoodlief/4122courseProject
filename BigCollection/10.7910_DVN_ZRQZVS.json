The market for nurses has been described as a classic monopsony, so that one might expect increases in firm market power to be associated with declines in wages. However, we show that if one extends the monopsony model to consider effort, or if we apply a basic contracting model to the data, then we would expect to see effects on effort rather than on wages. This prediction is bourne out by the data Â— nurses see few declines in wages following takeovers, but see increases in the number of patients per nurse, our measure of effort. We also find that these changes are similar in the largest for-profit and non-profit chains, suggesting that market forces are more important than institutional form."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment, wages, nurse, health"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005-04"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Industrial and Labor Relations Review"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/ilrreview/vol58/iss3/9/"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-08-06"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data on hospitals used for study.","label":"Currie_Farsi_Macleod_2005.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":50353,"dataFile":{"id":1517374,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Currie_Farsi_Macleod_2005.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":906736,"description":"Data on hospitals used for study.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:50540","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2fb366dd42892fb980d6a5b19e7fdda0","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2fb366dd42892fb980d6a5b19e7fdda0"}}}]}}}
