The German part of the study Political Ideology I is documented under ZA Study No. 757, the international study under ZA Study No. 0765. Besides the Federal Republic the Netherlands and the USA are also involved in the continuation project. In all three countries a follow-up survey of the persons interviewed in 1973 to 1976 and a new cross-section survey were conducted (survey year: Netherlands 1979 and USA 1981). The current description (ZA Study No. 1191) is based on the cross-section survey (1980) in the Federal Republic; the follow-up survey (1980) is documented under ZA Study No. 1190. An integrated data set of the cross-section and follow-up surveys of the three countries still involved in the continuation project exists under ZA Study Nos. 1188 and 1189.
