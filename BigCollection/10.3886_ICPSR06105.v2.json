It  assessed Central and Eastern Europeans' awareness of and attitudes  toward the European Community (EC) and its programs and activities. In  addition, the survey asked respondents to give opinions on a number of  issues of importance to all European nations. It also explored  citizens' reactions to the political and economic reforms occurring in  their own countries. Respondents were asked whether things in general  were going in the right or wrong direction in their country, and  whether economic reforms and privatization were occurring too fast or  too slowly. Other questions probed for how well individuals felt their  country's economy and their own finances had fared over the past year,  and how well they would fare over the coming year. Opinions were  sought on whether the establishment of a free market economy was right  or wrong. The survey asked respondents how satisfied they were with  the development of democracy in their country, and whether they  intended to vote in the next general election. It also elicited  opinions on the degree of respect for human rights in the respondent's  country. Other questions asked how frequently respondents thought of  themselves as European, and whether they had considered going to work  in a country in Western Europe. A series of items focused on general  usage of television, radio, and newspapers, and on trust in various  forms of information media, including broadcasts from the  West. Several country-specific questions were asked about sources of  information on the European Community. Respondents were also asked to  indicate how aware they were of, and how interested in, the European  Community and its activities and institutions, and to rate how  positively they regarded the\nEC and the prospect of their country's  membership in it. Participants were also asked about how the economy,  government, and private citizens might be advantaged or disadvantaged  by the country's increasing ties with the EC. Opinions were sought on  the fairness of the Community's and other countries' trade and  assistance policies, especially the PHARE assistance program for  Central and Eastern Europe, and EC aid requested by the former Soviet  Union. Respondents were asked to rate the usefulness of EC initiatives  in Yugoslavia and its republics if they were aware of them.  Respondents' views were also obtained on the break-up of the Soviet  republics. Demographic data collected on each participant included  age, education, occupation, religion, ethnic background,  mother-tongue, citizenship, union membership, left/right political  placement, sex, and income. A brief section, not asked in Albania,  obtained data on lifestyle characteristics, such as household  appliances and machines, recreation and hobby activities, and optimistic or pessimistic attitudes."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"democracy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic
