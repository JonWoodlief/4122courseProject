Nearly two decades of democracy assistance in the former Soviet Union (FSU), however, appear to have had a negligible impact on democracy in the region. This research uses a time-series cross-sectional statistical analysis to establish that US democracy assistance efforts in the FSU have failed to enhance democracy in the region. The incentives that FSU leaders had to misrepresent their commitment to democracy and the United States' understandable misperception of these leaders' actions help to explain this failure."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ISQ 2012, Volume 56, Issue 2"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bosin, Yury V., 2012, \"Supporting Democracy in the Former Soviet Union: Why the Impact of US Assistance Has Been Below Expectations\" International Studies Quarterly 56(2), 405â€“412:"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00713.x"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2478.2011.00713.x"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-06-08"}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[]}},"files":[{"label":"ISQ_Bosin_Assist_Democracy_FSU.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":138667,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":3184243,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MFDDLJ/V3RIFO","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MFDDLJ/V3RIFO","filename":"ISQ_Bosin_Assist_Democracy_FSU.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":219648,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1647ff962d3-38303da03d2b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"19375dfa89b58c122b01dd6c34bbe6c6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"19375dfa89b58c122b01dd6c34bbe6c6"}}}]}}}
