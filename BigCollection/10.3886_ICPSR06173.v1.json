(The male counterpart to this poll is WASHINGTON POST   CAPITOL HIL\nL MEN IN THE WORKPLACE POLL, JANUARY 1993 [ICPSR 6174].)   Opinion regarding the sexual harassment of women on the job was the   major focus of the survey, and was assessed by items such as whether   sexual harassment was a major problem in the United States, whether it   was a major problem for women who work on congressional staffs, and   whether it was a bigger problem for women working in congressional   staff positions in Washington than for working women in general. The   survey also asked whether women who work on congressional staffs were   reluctant to take formal action against men who sexually harass them,   and whether such reluctance was greater among women on Capitol Hill   than among working women in general. Other questions covered the   reasons female staffers might be reluctant to report incidents of   sexual harassment, whether the respondent personally knew any female   staffer who had been sexually harassed on the job, and whether the   respondent had been sexually harassed while working for Congress.   Additional questions concerned the alleged sexual misconduct of Senator   Robert Packwood toward female members of his congressional staff, and   the perceived frequency of sexual harassment of women staffers by   members of Congress. Further areas of inquiry dealt with the importance   of the respondent's job, the biggest problem facing congressional   staffers working on Capitol Hill, and the respondent's level of   satisfaction with various aspects of her job. Background information on   respondents includes political party, vote choice in the 1992   presidential election, education, age, length of time worked on Capitol   Hill, marital status, parental status, and whether the respondent's  duties on Capitol Hill involved supervisory responsibilities."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"females"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Packwood, Robert"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sexual harassment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
