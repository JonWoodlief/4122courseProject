The data were collected to study political communication and voting   behavior during an election campaign. While the Main Respondent Data   (Part 1) provide the central database, these data are supplemented by   other data sources. The data collection combines three related surveys:   a survey of 1,318 mai\nn respondents (Part 1), a survey of 271 spouses of  the main respondents (Part 2), and a survey of 841 non-spouse   discussion partners of the main respondents (Part 3). Part 4 supplies   the text of open-ended question responses given by respondents to all   three surveys. Part 5 provides information coded from articles in  major local newspapers on issues dealing with the 1992 election  campaign. Topics of investigation in this study concerned factors   that influenced respondents' level of information about politics and   public affairs, political awareness, and voting behavior, such as the   kinds of newspapers and magazines respondents read, what national   network news they watched, and whether they watched talk shows.   Additional questions addressed candidate evaluations, general attitudes   toward public offices and election campaigns, and participation in   special interest groups, including political parties. The study also   queried respondents about their feelings on topics such as affirmative   action, foreign imports, using military force to overthrow Saddam   Hussein, the budget deficit, medical insurance, abortion, minority aid,   and the environment. Demographic characteristics of respondents include   educational level, occupational status, income level, age, gender, race   and ethnicity, marital status, religious preference, group affiliation,  and social status."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.A.2.a.
