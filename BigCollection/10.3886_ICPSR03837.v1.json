Residents of Washington, DC, were polled on their level of trust in Mayor Marion Barry, the city council, and the United States Congress to make budget cuts fairly, whether each was trying hard enough to deal with the city's budget problems, whether Mayor Marion Barry was moving too quickly or too slowly in making budge\nt cuts, and whether factors like a poor economy and too many city workers were important factors in the city's budget crisis. Respondents were asked whether the city was moving in the right or wrong direction, and rated the quality of Washington, DC's, parks and recreation facilities, programs for the elderly, public schools, public health facilities, public libraries, and streets, as well as the job done by city police, fire department, and ambulance services. Views were sought on United States Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, City Council Chairperson David Clarke, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, and political activist Jesse Jackson. Respondents were polled on whether they favored or opposed Congress appointing a federal board to temporarily manage the city's finances, whether Congress should take permanent control of the city's finances, and whether Newt Gingrich was serious about helping the city solve its financial problems. A series of questions addressed the effects of the budget cuts on rich, middle class, and poor residents of the city, and whether cutting spending and programs would make the city a better or worse place to live in the long run. Respondents were asked whether they wanted to move to the Maryland or Virginia suburbs, whether they had seriously considered moving, and whether the city's budget problems were a factor in their decision to move. Additional questions asked whether Washington, DC, should become a part of Maryland or a separate state. Background variables include sex, age, education, ethnicity, household income, political party, the part of the city in which the respondent resided, whether respondents were registered to vote, whether they voted in the last mayoral general election and Democratic mayoral primary election and if so, for whom."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Barry, Marion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"budget cuts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gingrich, Newt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jackson, Jesse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
