Three separate  surveys were conducted, with an elite sample (the present study), a  sample of the adult population (SURVEY OF BOTSWANA POLITICAL  PARTICIPATION, 1970: MASS SAMPLE [ICPSR 7362]), and a sample of  secondary school studen\nts (SURVEY OF BOTSWANA POLITICAL PARTICIPATION,  1970: SECONDARY SCHOOL SAMPLE [ICPSR 7351]). The elite sample was  selected from participants at governmental, trade, and professional  meetings and conventions. Respondents included members of parliament,  district council members, teachers, union and cooperative leaders,  members of women's associations, civil servants, and university  students. The questionnaire elicited views on the structure of local  and national decision-making processes and the relationship between  traditional (tribal) and modern (elected) loci of power. Variables  assessed respondents' perceptions of the power structure, their  participation in local politics and other decision-making processes,  their political knowledge, and views of community  cohesion. Demographic data include sex, age, education, marital  status, number of children, parents' education, father's occupation,  tribal affiliation, intra-tribal class, media usage, travel experience, and source of livelihood."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political awareness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public officials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.B.2.
