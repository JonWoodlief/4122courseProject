Measure 11 sentences superseded  any lesser existing guideline sentences for 21 violent and sex  offenses -- the original 16, plus five more added in 1995 and 1997 --  and ranged from 70 months for second degree assault, kidnapping,  robbery, and certain sex offenses, to 300 months for murder. In  general, Measure 11 penalties were longer than those imposed under  sentencing guidelines. Juveniles aged 15 years or older were also  subject to the measure. The researchers addressed the implementation  and impact of the measure on prosecution, sentencing, and convictions,  both statewide and in three separate counties, and sought to address  the following research questions: What was the sentencing context into  which Measure 11 was implemented? What other sentencing reforms and  major changes had occurred in the state prior to 1994 when the measure  was approved by Oregon voters? How was Measure 11 implemented? Were  all Measure 11 eligible offenses sentenced according to the new  measure? Did the researchers see changes in the manner in which  offenses were prosecuted by the district attorney? What impact did  Measure 11 have on trial rates? Did the measure inundate the courts  with requests for trials as critics feared? What are the  characteristics of offenders sentenced under Measure 11? Did the  measure appear to differentially affect minorities and youths? What  impact did the measure have on prison admissions and sentence lengths?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In order to assess the impact of Measure 11 and  other Oregon mandatory sentencing laws, trends in case processing,  sentencing, and prison admissions in Oregon during the 1990s were  examined. Data sources were analyzed at both the state level and for  the three most populous counties for which complete data were  available: Lane (Eugene), Marion (Salem), and Multnomah (Portland).  Data available\nin this collection were obtained from (1) the Oregon  Criminal Justice Commission's (OCJC) database and (2) the Oregon  Department of Corrections' (DOC) database. The OCJC maintained data on  all sentences for felony offenses in Oregon. These data, available for  1993 through 1999, were extracted from forms filled out at the county  level upon completion of sentencing. In addition to indicating trends  in sentence type and length before and after Measure 11, OCJC data  allowed the researchers to gauge the impact of prior criminal history  on sentencing and to determine method of disposition (plea vs. trial)  before and after passage of Measure 11. OCJC data were also used to  examine the possible effects of Measure 11 on the number of youths  sentenced as adults and to track changes in disposition patterns. The  Oregon Department of Corrections (DOC) maintained data for each felony  case under the department's supervision, available from 1990 through  1999, including all cases sentenced to jail, probation, prison, and  local control. These data were used to examine trends in the number of  prison admissions for M11-eligible and M11-alternate cases before and  after the passage of Measure 11, as well as trends in sentence  length. At the state level, patterns of charges, sentencing, prison  admissions, type of sentence, and sentence length were examined.  Whenever it was appropriate, separate analyses were performed on youthful offenders who had been sentenced as adults."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables in Part 1 (Oregon Criminal Justice  Commission Data) include data year, offender gender, race, and age at  sentencing, county of sentencing, plea trial information, first,  second, and third most serious conviction offenses, inchoate offense  information, total number of convictions, criminal history score,  sentence type, prison term for current convictions, severity and  severity codes for offense, and whether the case included an  M11-eligible or M11-alternate offense.
