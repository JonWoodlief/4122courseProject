How would an event that increases the prominence of terrorism, like a threat or attack, affect the 2008 election? The purpose of this study is to examine the role that exposure to terror threats has on the American publicâ€™s view of presidential candidates and candidate preferences; specifically, the effect that terror threats have on political attitudes. Moreover, researchers were interested in if Americans' view of the war on terror remained the same or changed. The survey was conducted by Knowledge Networks (KN) over the Internet in May 2006, using a nationally representative sample of 1282 American adults. KN recruits panel members over the telephone via random digit dialing (RDD) and provides them with WebTV equipment in exchange for their participation in weekly surveys, which they complete online. The major variables in this study consisted of demographic variables in addition to presidential approval, ranked importance, and preferred candidate in the 2008 presidential election. Researchers looked at political psychology batteries including variables such as measures of tolerance for ambiguity, openness to uncertainty, social dominance orientation, and traditionalism."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"democracy"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elections"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ideologies"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preparedness"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist incidents"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preparedness"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Willer, R., & Adams, N.

The first is half-sampling of telephone numbers for which no address could be found. The second is RDD sampling rates proportional to the number of phone lines in the household. The third is minor oversampling of Chicago and Los Angeles due to early pilot surveys in these two cities. The fourth is short-term double-sampling of the four largest states (CA, NY, FL, and TX) and central region states. The fifth is under-sampling of households not covered by MSN TV. The sixth is oversampling of minority households (Black and Hispanic). Finally, the seventh weight is the selection of one adult per household. In order to calculate final weights, the researchers derived weighted sample distributions along various combinations of five variables. The first is gender (male, female). The second is age (18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60 and over). The third is race/ethnicity (White, Black, other, Hispanic). The fourth is region (northeast, Midwest, south, west). Finally, the fifth variable is education (highest level achieved: less than high school, high school, some college, college degree or more). Similar distributions are calculated using the most recent U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data and the Knowledge Network panel data. Cell-by-cell adjustments over the various univariate and bivariate distributions are calculated to make the weighted sample cells match those of the U.S. Census and the Knowledge Network panel."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The response rate was 59.1% (1282 out of 2171)."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Terror_Warnings_Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43268,"dataFile":{"id":2300961,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Terror_Warnings_Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":267704,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69766","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9959bc8b74c2f250be937946c811751e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9959bc8b74c2f250be937946c811751e"}}},{"description":"","label":"Terror_Warnings_Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43268,"dataFile":{"id":2300962,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Terror_Warnings_Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":183232,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69764","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","originalFileSize":286643,"UNF":"UNF:5:pldMDjmyEyaJebTqNDy95A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"aa411c12941919c07f7da9451cb5f995","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"aa411c12941919c07f7da9451cb5f995"}}},{"description":"","label":"Terror_Warnings_Questionnaire.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43268,"dataFile":{"id":2300960,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Terror_Warnings_Questionnaire.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":60297,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:69765","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f191cd8b39cc87e15785bc311c54a333","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f191cd8b39cc87e15785bc311c54a333"}}}]}}}
