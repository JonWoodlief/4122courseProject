The research project sought to obtain information from a  broad sample of high-school-aged youth to achieve diversity regarding  history, cultural background, population size and density, urban and  non-urban mix, economic situation, and class, race, and ethnic  distributions. Data for the study were derived from two surveys  conducted during the spring of 1996. The first survey was a lengthy  questionnaire that focused on exposure to weapons (primarily firearms  and knives) and violence, and was completed by 733 10th- and  11th-grade male students. Detail was gathered on all weapon-related  incidents up to 12 months prior to the survey. The second survey,  consisting of a questionnaire completed by 48 administrators of the  53 schools that the students attended, provided information regarding  school characteristics, levels of weapon-related activity in the  schools, and anti-violence strategies employed by the schools. The  student survey covered demographic characteristics of the respondent,  family living situations, educational situations and aspirations,  drug, criminal, and gang activities, crime- and violence-related  characteristics of family and friends, respondent's social and  recreational activities, exposure to violence generally, personal  victimization history, and possession of and activities relating to  firearms and knives. Administrators were asked to provide basic  demographic data about their schools and to rate the seriousness of  violence, drugs, guns, and other weapons in their institutions. They  were asked to provide weapon-related information about the average  male junior in their schools as well as to estimate the number of  incidents involving types of weapons on school grounds during the past  three years. The administrators were also asked to identify, from an  extensive list of violence reduction measures, those that were  practiced at their schools. Variables are also provided about the type  of school, grades taught, enrollment, and size of the community. In  addition to the data collected directly from students and school  administrators, Census information concerning the cities and towns in  which the sampled schools were located was also obtained.

Past national-level studies asked only  very general questions about weapon-related violence among  youth. Other studies that utilized more select samples and provided  slightly more detail were hampered by questions of generalizability,  not the least of which pertai\nned to their urban, and often inner-city,  focus. What is singularly absent from the store of information about  youth, weapons, and violence is detailed data from the broader  spectrum of American juveniles -- high-school-aged youth from a range  of social and geographic environments. This research project sought to  obtain information from a broad sample of high-school-aged youth to  achieve diversity regarding history, cultural diversity, population  size and density, urban and non-urban mix, economic situation, and  class, race, and ethnic distributions. This study sought to address  the following important questions regarding weapon-related activity  among youth: (1) If weapons are indeed prevalent among youth, what  kinds of weapons are they? (2) To what use are they put -- protection,  intimidation, crime?  (3) In what settings are weapons carried -- on  school grounds or away from school? (4) Does weapon-carrying differ in  quantity and quality across the urban and non-urban spectrum and  across racial and ethnic groups, social classes, and age groups? (5)  In what ways are these behaviors linked to criminal, gang, and drug  activity among youth? (6) Does weapon-related victimization vary  across urban and non-urban settings and across sociodemographic  categories that distinguish youth? (7) In what ways does involvement  in illegal activities by youth increase the likelihood of  weapon-related victimization? (8) What kinds of guns are young people  likely to possess or carry? (9) Where and how do juveniles obtain  their firearms? (10) Is the link between drug trafficking and the  possession and use of guns by students more or less strong than the  link between drug activity and the possession and use of other types of weapons?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data for this study were derived from two surveys  conducted during the spring of 1996.

The second survey, consisting of a  questionnaire completed by 48 administrators of the 53 schools that the  students attended, provided information regarding school  characteristics, levels of weapon-related activity in the schools, and  anti-violence strategies employed by the schools. Researchers  initially sought to procure lists of 10th and 11th-grade students from  which they would choose a sample. In 8 of the 53 schools, project  staff were allowed to obtain the lists and choose a sample of 10  percent. They sent each student in the sample a letter describing the  study and guaranteeing confidentiality, a copy of the survey, a  postage-paid return envelope, and a ticket which, when completed and  returned with the survey, granted the respondent eligibility to win  one of ten cash prizes of $100 to be awarded through a  drawing. Distribution of these student surveys followed Dillman's  (1978, 1983) Total Design Method. Two follow-up letters were sent to  those who did not respond to the original request. The principals from  the remaining 45 participating schools chose to select the 10-percent  sample from their rosters themselves, via a prescribed method: The  researchers chose a number from one to ten. Principals started with  the assigned number and counted down, selecting every tenth  student. The principals then forwarded to their students, by mail, the  packet described above with cover letters they had written. In a few  schools, the administrators worked with the researchers to develop a  numbering system by which they could identify and mail a second packet  to students who had not responded to the first mailing. The majority,  however, did not have the resources to develop a follow-up  effort. Most student respondents completed over 95 percent of the  items in the survey. All administr\nators who responded completed the  entire administrator's survey. Student and administrator  questionnaires were primarily forced-choice.
