A  related goal was to discern trends, variations, and expansion of CPTED  principles traditionally employed in crime prevention and  deterrence. \"Security by design\" stems from the theory that proper  design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a  reduction in the incidence and fear of crime and an improvement in  quality of life. Examples are improving street lighting in high-crime  locations, traffic re-routing and control to hamper drug trafficking  and other crimes, inclusion of security provisions in city building  codes, and comprehensive review of planned development to ensure  careful consideration of security. To gather these data, the United  States Conference of Mayors (USCM), which had previously studied a  variety of issues including the fear of crime, mailed a survey to the  mayors of 1,060 cities in 1994. Follow-up surveys were sent in 1995  and 1996. The surveys gathered information about the role of CPTED in  a variety of local government policies and procedures, local  ordinances, and regulations relating to building, local development,  and zoning. Information was also collected on processes that offered  opportunities for integrating CPTED principles into local development  or redevelopment and the incorporation of CPTED into decisions about  the location, design, and management of public facilities. Questions  focused on whether the city used CPTED principles, which CPTED  techniques were used (architectural features, landscaping and  landscape materials, land-use planning, physical security devices,  traffic circulation systems, or other), the city department with  primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with CPTED zoning  ordinances/building codes and other departments that actively  participated in that enforcement (mayor's office, fire department,  public works department, planning department, city manager, economic  development office, police department, building department, parks and  recreation, zoning department, city attorney, community development  office, or other), the review process for proposed development,  security measures for public facilities, traffic diversion and  control, and urban beautification programs. Respondents were also  asked about other security-by-design features being used, including  whether they were mandatory or optional, if optional, how they were  instituted (legislation, regulation, state building code, or other),  and if applicable, how they were legislated (city ordinance, city  resolution, or state law). Information was also collected on the  perceived effectiveness of each technique, if local development  regulations existed regarding convenience stores, if joint code  enforcement was in place, if banks, neighborhood groups, private  security agencies, or other groups were involved in the traffic  diversion and control program, and the responding city's population, per ca\npita income, and form of government."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Crime prevention and deterrence rank among the  top priorities of local governments. \"Security by design\" stems from  the theory that proper design and effective use of the built  environment can lead to a reduction in the incidence and fear of crime  and an improvement in quality of life.
