Respondents were also asked whether they had favorable impressions of   Bush, Clinton, Perot, Quayle, and Gore, whether they were satisfied   with the candidates who were running, and whether Clinton's selection   of Al Gore as his vice-presidential running mate made it more likely   that the respondent would vote for Clinton. Regarding Bush and   Clinton, respondents were asked about each candidate's honesty,   integrity, and ability to understand the problems of average   Americans, whether the views of each candidate were too liberal or   conservative, and which candidate would do the best job with the   economy and with bringing the needed changes to government. In   addition, those surveyed were asked whether Bush should keep Quayle   on the ticket, whether they would approve if Bush decided not to keep   Quayle on the ticket, whether it would be better for the country to   have a younger or an older president, and whether the economy was   getting better. Respondents were also asked to identify the correct   spelling of \"potato\".
