The aims of the Scottish  Election Survey survey were (1) to contribute to the construction of a  time series on electoral change at a time when political divergence  was one of the key features of political behavior within the United  Kingdom (UK), (2) to model political behavior and attitudes in  Scotland with regard to Britain as a whole, the nations and regions of  the UK, and within Scotland itself, (3) to understand nationalism in  Scotland in the wider European context, and (4) to provide a benchmark  for assessing the outcomes of Scottish Parliament elections and  against which to assess future constitutional change. Respondents were  asked for their opinions on the possibility of a separate Scottish  Parliament, the Scottish National Party, how the European Union will  affect Scotland, the economic benefits to both England and Scotland of  Scotland's being part of the UK, social class differences between  England and Scotland, the relationship between Protestants and  Catholics in Scotland, the importance of a Scottish heritage, and the  faith held by the Scottish that British political parties will work in  their interest. Additionally, topics repeated from the Cross-Section  Survey include the 1997 campaign, participation in 1997 local  elections, British political parties, trust in government, images of  British leadership, the European Union, Northern Ireland, nuclear  weapons, unemployment, inflation, nationalization and privatization of  companies, redistribution of income, women's rights, the role of  government in social policy, abortion, ethnic minorities, the British  economy, political knowledge, and the future of governmental  institut\nions such as the House of Lords. Background information on  respondents includes age, sex, race, ethnicity, political party,  political orientation, marital status, number of members in household,  social class, employment history, health insurance status,  citizenship, country of birth, voter registration and participation  history, household income, education, religion, parents' employment  history, parents' voting behavior, spouse's employment history, and union membership."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"constitutional
