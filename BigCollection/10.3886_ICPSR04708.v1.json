Geographic variables  describing residence for births include the state, county, city,  county and city population size, metropolitan statistical area (MSA),  primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA), consolidated  metropolitan statistical area (CMSA), New England County metropolitan  area (NECMA), and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan county. Other variables  include place of delivery, person in attendance, live-birth order, and  medical and health data such as the number of prenatal visits, tobacco  and alcohol use during pregnancy, method of delivery, medical risk  factors, and infant health characteristics. Birth and fertility rates  and other statistics related to this study can be found in the  National Vital Statistics Report in the codebook documentation.

ICPSR is distributing the data and documentation for this  collection in essentially the same form in which they were received.  When appropriate, documentation has been converted to Portable  Document Format (PDF), data files have been converted to  non-platform-specific formats, and variables have been recoded to  ensure respondents' anonymity. (2) Per agreement with NCHS, ICPSR  is distributing the data files and text of the technical documentation  for this collection as prepar\ned by NCHS. (3) The codebook is provided  by the principal investigator as a Portable Document Format (PDF)  file. (4) The geographic code structure, as well as populations and  population-based rates listed in the codebook documentation, were  based on the results of the 1990 Census of Population. As a result,  rates were generally larger than would be the case if 2000-based  estimates had been used. The magnitude of the overestimate varies by  population group.
