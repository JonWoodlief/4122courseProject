Data were collected on six types of employment-related  health insurance policies, the first five of which were issued or  administered by commercial insurance companies and BC/BS plans:  ins\nured indemnity plans written for groups with under 100 employees,  insured indemnity plans written for groups with 100 or more employees,  self-insured plans administered by a commercial company or BS/BC plan  (administrative services only contracts), preferred provider  organizations, point-of-service networks, and HMOs. Three major issues  were addressed: whether specific reproductive care services were  covered, whether the dependents of insured individuals were covered  for all services included in the plan, and whether the plans had  provisions for patients to obtain confidential care. Reproductive  services investigated by the survey include routine gynecological  care, maternity care, reversible contraception, contraceptive sterilization, induced abortion, and infertility treatment."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA II.
