The study was conducted using a pretest and two post-tests on an experimental group and a comparison group. The pretest (Time 1) was given to 118 juveniles. The first post-test (Time 2) was completed by 78 juveniles and the second post-test (Time 3) was completed by 37 juveniles. The tests were designed to measure the respondents' perceptions of certainty of punishment, as well as to measure their out of home activities. Important variables included in the study are levels of parental supervision, self-reported behaviors of the juvenile respondent, perceived severity of punishments, measures of impulsiveness, and self-reported victimization of the respondent, as well as variables related to the Nightwatch program, including the number of visits, sanctions or rewards received by the respondent."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the  curfew check program in St. Louis, Missouri, known as Nightwatch, by  determining whether the program meets its stated goals of reducing  recidivism and victimization, as well as the mechanism by which this  is accomplished. This research sought to assess how the use of  graduated sanctioning affects a juvenile's perceptions of the  certainty and severity of punishment, and whether different formal punishments invoke different perceptions."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To evaluate the impact of Nightwatch on recidivism  and victimization, the study administered a pretest and two post-tests  to an experimental group and a comparison group between December 2003  and January 2005. The experimental group of 55 juveniles received  Nightwatch visits according to their court orders issued by the  judge. The comparison group of 24 juveniles did not receive Nightwatch  visits, and there are several reasons why this occurred, including  residing outside the city, participating in the Victim/Offender  Mediation (VOM) program, and being assigned to the program after the  Time 2 survey was administered. Juveniles were given a pretest prior  to their assignment to Nightwatch in order to establish a basis for  their perceptions of certainty of punishment, as well as to measure  their out-of-home activities. Informed consent was obtained from 132  study eligible juveniles. The pretests (Time 1) were administered to  118 juveniles (14 juveniles declined to participate in the study after  giving informed consent) as soon as possible after informed consent  was obtained, with all pretests completed within four days of  obtaining it. With the exception of five juveniles who were  interviewed at the VOM office, all juveniles were given the pretest  while in the detention center. Two post-tests (Time 2 and Time 3) were  administered, with a target interval of roughly two months, to measure  any changes in perceptions or opportunities over time. At Time 2, 78  juveniles completed surveys. At Time 3, 37 juveniles completed  surveys. Post-testing for juveniles under official court supervision  occurred at variable points, and took advantage of times when the  juvenile was required to come to the court on official business. This  two-month post-test target coincides with the court's policy that  every juvenile on official court supervision have a review hearing  every 60 days. Post-testing for the VOM memb\ners of the comparison  group was slightly different, since juveniles participating in VOM are  not required to attend status conferences, and there is no  adjudication. Instead, VOM staff agreed to arrange extra office visits as needed to complete post-tests."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"These data contain demographic variables on the  respondent including age, gender, race, neighborhood in which the  respondent lives, and with whom. Further information on the respondent  includes whether the respondent is in the experimental or comparison  group, prior participation in VOM or other programs, current charge  the respondent is facing, prior referrals and charges, and the number  of days the respondent has been in detention. Respondents were asked  about: levels of parental supervision (do you tell your parents where  you are, who you are with, etc.), behaviors (how many nights per week  do you spend watching TV, doing homework, joyriding, hanging out,  etc.), moral views (how wrong is it to skip school, lie to your  parents, break curfew, cause property damage, etc.),severity of  punishments (how bad would it be to have to write a book report, pick  up trash, or receive detention), and the reactions of others (parents,  friends, teachers, and employers) to the respondent's behavior.  Respondents were also asked how likely they were to break the law, how  guilty they would feel if they were not caught, and the likelihood of  being caught. To develop an impulse index, respondents were asked to  rate their behavior and agree or disagree with the following: I act on  impulse, I act on the spur of the moment, I consider consequences, I  do not act hastily, I do things I regret later, and I act first, think  later. Respondents were also asked to self-report any incidences of  delinquency (skipping school, breaking curfew, vandalism, etc.) and  victimization (assault, robbery, etc.). Finally, there are variables  related to the Nightwatch program including the number of Nightwatch  visits, if the juvenile was home during the visit, the number of  sanctions and rewards received, the type of sanction and if it was  completed on time, and the number of doublebacks (extra visits for juveniles suspected of leaving the house after the initial check)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"curfew"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"delinquent behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile courts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile justice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile sentencing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"outcome evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"punishment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"status offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victimization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

Time 1 surveys were administered to 118  juveniles, which was roughly a 10 percent sampling of juvenile court  referrals. Juveniles included in this study fell into one of three  groups\n: those on official court supervision that received Nightwatch  visits, those on official court supervision that did not receive  Nightwatch visits, and those who participated in Victim/Offender  Mediation (VOM). Juveniles in the first group constituted the  experimental group (55 individuals), while those in the remaining two  groups constituted the comparison group (24 individuals). The only  selection criterion for inclusion in the study was that subjects had  no prior Nightwatch participation. Other variables including age, sex,  and offense type did not play a role in determining sample selection.  Juveniles participating in VOM were selected as the comparison group  for several reasons. First, juveniles who were eligible for VOM must  have had limited previous contact with the court and no prior  adjudications that assumed no prior Nightwatch participation. Second,  juveniles who participated in VOM were not assigned to Nightwatch when  the study began. Thus, the two groups were similar in their prior  court contacts, but one group received Nightwatch contacts, while the  other did not. This study should not be generalized directly to other  sites given the small sample size, high rates of attrition, and the fact that it was limited to only one study site."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"face-to-face interview"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"none"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In Time 1, 344 juveniles were eligible and 118  participated, for a response rate of 34 percent.
