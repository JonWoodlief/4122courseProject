The netcdf file contains samples from the synthetic ensemble of DJF temperatures over North America from 1966-2015. The synthetic ensemble is centered on the observed trend. Recentering the ensemble on the ensemble mean trend from the NCAR CESM1 LENS will create the Observational Large Ensemble, in which each sample can be viewed as a temperature history that could have occurred given various samplings of internal variability.
