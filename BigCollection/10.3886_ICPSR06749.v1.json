Additional  questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the  European Union (EU), including how well-informed they felt about the  EU, what sources of information about the EU they used, whether their  country had benefited from being an EU member, and the extent of their  personal interest in EU matters. Another major focus of the surveys  was the rights of EU citizens as well as issues of work safety, sun  exposure, and personal interviews. Respondents were asked about their  knowledge of and the importance of rights such as traveling, working,  buying, investing, studying, voting, and receiving medical care  anywhere in the EU. Respondents provided further interpretation as to  the meaning of some rights by indicating whether the right to live  anywhere includes the right to permanently relocate, work, vote, or  retire, if the right to work anywhere includes the right to set up a  business, receive unemployment, receive retirement pay, or work as a  civil servant, if the right to study includes equal access to schools,  universities, scholarships, or exchange programs, and if purchasing  rights include the right to buy any amount of goods f\nor personal or  other use. Questions concerning work safety asked respondents about  their satisfaction with steps taken to guarantee health and safety in  the workplace and whether employers, government inspectors, worker  representatives, company committees, or individual workers should  contribute more or less in order to reduce work accidents or  work-related illnesses. Responses were also elicited regarding whether  health and safety in the workplace contribute to worker efficiency,  benefits for the people, economic benefits, and costs that are  difficult for the employer to cover. Issues surrounding interviewing  and personal data were also investigated. Respondents were asked if  interviewing is a proper scientific tool, whether the interview format  allows people to express their opinions, and whether it enables  decision-makers to take people's views into account. Respondents were  also asked if interviewing represents a form of intrusion and whether  people need legal protection against the misuse of data. Respondents  also indicated whether they thought individuals should have the  decision as to whether their personal information can be passed on to  someone else. Respondents' attitudes and opinions about sun exposure  were also probed. Questions included whether respondents thought sun  exposure was good or bad for their health, how best to protect  themselves from the sun, and what type of skin, eye color, and hair  color they had. Questions also examined respondents' opinions on  European currency. Demographic and other background information  provided includes respondent's age, sex, marital status, and  left-right political self-placement, as well as household income, the number of people residing in the home, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil rights"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"euro"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European unification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupational safety and health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"privacy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
