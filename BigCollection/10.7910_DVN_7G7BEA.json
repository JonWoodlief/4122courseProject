Conventionally, an arterial cannula over 15Fr is inserted for full circulatory support in peripheral VA ECMO. However, limited data are available regarding the impact of cannula size on clinical and procedural outcomes.\r\nMethods: Between January 2014 and April 2016, 165 patients underwent peripheral VA ECMO with femoral artery cannulation were enrolled in a single-center registry. We classified patients into 2 groups according to the arterial cannula’s size: ‘Small cannula group’ (14-15Fr, n = 87) and ‘Large cannula group’ (16-21Fr, n = 78). We compared the clinical outcomes and procedural-related complications between the two groups.\r\nResults: Neither the in-hospital mortality (48.3% in the small cannula group vs. 42.3% in the large cannula group; p = 0.44) nor the weaning success rate (70.1% in the small cannula group vs. 64.1% in the large cannula group; p = 0.41) were significantly different between the two groups. The small cannula group showed significantly lower initial pump flow (3.2 [2.5-3.7] vs. 3.5 [3.0-4.0] L/min; p = 0.02) and shorter ECMO duration time (2.6 [0.7-5.2] vs. 4.0 [1.3-7.8] day; p < 0.01). Also, lower limb ischemia was significantly lower in the small cannula group than in large cannula group (4.6% vs. 15.4%; p = 0.02). But other complications (including cannula site or non-cannula site bleeding, thrombotic events, coagulopathy, or sepsis) were not significantly different between the two groups.\r\nConclusions: In peripheral VA ECMO, as compared with the large cannula strategy, the small arterial cannula strategy showed similar clinical outcomes and a decrease in lower limb ischemia."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-12-27"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Kim, Juwon"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-12-27"}]}},"files":[{"label":"ECMO cannula (Harvard Dataverse).xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":96900,"dataFile":{"id":2966964,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/7G7BEA/AVNDMN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/7G7BEA/AVNDMN","filename":"ECMO cannula (Harvard Dataverse).xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":55225,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1593f855c06-b463f6dda9e4","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4d96c22c6d206507d6ab16f90889b066","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4d96c22c6d206507d6ab16f90889b066"}}}]}}}
