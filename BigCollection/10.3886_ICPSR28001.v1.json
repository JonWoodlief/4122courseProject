This census, which is conducted every four years, includes all state and local law enforcement agencies operating nationwide that are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers. As in previous years, the 2004 census collected data on the number of sworn and nonsworn personnel employed by each agency, including both full-time and part-time employees. The pay period that included September 30, 2004, was the reference date for all personnel data. Variables include personnel totals, type of government, type of agency, and whether the agency had the legal authority to hold a person beyond arraignment for 48 or more hours.
