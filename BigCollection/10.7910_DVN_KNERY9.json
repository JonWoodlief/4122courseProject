2016."]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The project began by identifying all predecessor groups to ISIL, including: Tawhid and Jihad, al-Qaida in Iraq, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), the Mujahedeen Shura Council, and al-Nusrah Front (for the period of time before it broke from ISIL). With the exception of al-Nusrah Front, these other groups represent name changes of the group leading up to the adoption of the ISIL name in 2013.\r\n\r\nISIL affiliates were then identified by including all organizations identified as an Islamic State wilayat or “province” and that include this identity in their names. This led to the inclusion of 20 such organizations named as perpetrators in the GTD, including Boko Haram, which ostensibly adopted the name “Islamic State West Africa Province” upon declaring allegiance to ISIL. However, this name has not been widely adopted in favor of “Boko Haram.”\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive search of open source materials was then conducted to identify other organizations that made specific statements indicating that they act in support of the Islamic State and al-Baghdadi. Through this process 15 additional ISIL-affiliated perpetrator organizations were included. In certain cases, source materials indicated that elements of a group had declared allegiance to ISIL, but that this sentiment was not widely shared among all members. For example, the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the Philippines was not included among ISIL affiliates, despite the fact that ASG leaders announced allegiance to ISIL around the same time BIFM leaders did. Subsequent reports indicated that certain ASG battalions may have actually defected from ASG to join ISIL. Likewise, although reports indicate that some al-Shabaab members have pledged allegiance to ISIL, this is certainly a source of division within al-Shabaab and is characterized as defection rather than shifting allegiance of the group itself. \r\n\r\nThe 35 identified groups include: the Adan-Abyan Province of the Islamic State, Ahfad al-Sahaba-Aknaf Bayt al-Maqdis, the Algeria Province of the Islamic State, Ansar Al-Khilafa (Philippines), the Bahrain Province of the Islamic State, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Movement (BIFM), the Barqa Province of the Islamic State, Boko Haram, the Caucasus Province of the Islamic State, the Fezzan Province of the Islamic State, the Hadramawt Province of the Islamic State, the Hijaz Province of the Islamic State, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), the Islamic State in Bangladesh, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), Jabha East Africa, Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, Jund al-Khilafa (Algeria), Jund al-Khilafah (Tunisia), Jundallah, the Khorasan Chapter of the Islamic State, the Lahij Province of the Islamic State, the Maute Group, Mujahidin Indonesia Timur (MIT), the Najd Province of the Islamic State, the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, the Sanaa Province of the Islamic State, the Shabwah Province of the Islamic State, the Sheikh Omar Hadid Brigade, the Sinai Province of the Islamic State, Supporters of the Islamic State in Jerusalem, Supporters of the Islamic State in the Land of the Two Holy Mosques, Tehrik-e-Khilafat, and the Tripoli Province of the Islamic State.\r\n\r\nIn 32 cases source materials attributed responsibility for an attack to ISIL generically in locations and time periods where there was more than one ISIL affiliate known to be active or where an ISIL affiliated group would formally emerge shortly thereafter. Due to lack of information about which specific organization or emerging affiliate was implicated in the attack the perpetrator of record in the GTD was ISIL “core.” However, unless sources specifically indicated that these attacks were carried out by “core” ISIL operatives, we classified them as attacks by ISIL affiliated perpetrators for the purpose of this analysis.\r\n\r\nThe GTD includes information about the motive of each attack, as reported in source materials. To identify the attacks that were carried out by perpetrators inspired by, but not directly linked to ISIL, the event summaries and motives fields were reviewed for references to ISIL. Additional information about attack motives for those events attributed to unaffiliated individuals or Muslim extremists was then sought out. In order to classify an attack as ISIL-inspired, statements made by the perpetrator(s) or other direct evidence (e.g., journals, social media messaging) were relied upon. In four cases, ISIL-inspired attacks were claimed by organizations (al-Shabaab, Hamas, Jund Ansar Allah and Kilafah Islamic Movement) rather than unaffiliated individuals. Although these organizations had not explicitly declared allegiance to ISIL, sources indicated that the attacks were inspired by ISIL."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"record abstracts"},{"typeName":"dataCollectionSituation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Terrorist attacks in the GTD were classified into four ISIL-related perpetrator categories. ISIL Predecessor identifies attacks by organizations that were part of the ISIL lineage prior to adoption of the ISIL name in 2013. ISIL identifies attacks by operatives of the “core” of the organization, based in, and primarily active in, Iraq and Syria. ISIL Affiliate identifies attacks by organizations that have declared allegiance to ISIL. ISIL-Inspired identifies attacks by individuals who have indicated that they were motivated by allegiance to ISIL. Finally, a fifth variable, ISIL-Related, identifies whether any of the above conditions were met."}]}},"files":[{"label":"Global Terrorism Database ISIL-Related Auxiliary Dataset 2017.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":129365,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":3058431,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KNERY9/XAQPDR","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KNERY9/XAQPDR","filename":"Global Terrorism Database ISIL-Related Auxiliary Dataset 2017.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":94092,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f2651618b-45618c8a4cab","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"28c9d8ee4b89d5b6ca832c14a534b8af","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"28c9d8ee4b89d5b6ca832c14a534b8af"}}},{"label":"globalterrorismdb_ISILauxiliary_2002-2016.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":129365,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":3037410,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KNERY9/GQTVDO","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KNERY9/GQTVDO","filename":"globalterrorismdb_ISILauxiliary_2002-2016.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3576173,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15d665db7fd-7bdb0666399b","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","originalFileSize":2522374,"UNF":"UNF:6:NZKpt0ABU0BeIRZlBVnbpw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2778407b8a91cbcf558e2102f6765f2b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2778407b8a91cbcf558e2102f6765f2b"}}}]}}}
