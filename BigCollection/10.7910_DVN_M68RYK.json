Yet, despite claims that the\r\nstandard can be readily adapted to very different corporate and geographic settings, its take-up has been\r\nhighly geographically variable. This paper contributes to a growing body of work concerned with\r\nexplaining the uneven diffusion of ISO 14001 at the global level. Drawing from the existing theoretical\r\nand empirical literature we develop a series of hypotheses about how various economic, market, and\r\nregulatory factors influence the national count of ISO 14001 certifications. These hypotheses are then\r\ntested using econometric estimation techniques with data for a panel of 142 developed and developing\r\ncountries. We find that per capita ISO 14001 counts are positively correlated with income per capita,\r\nstock of foreign direct investment, exports of goods and services to Europe and Japan, and pressure from\r\ncivil society. Conversely, productivity and levels of state intervention are negatively correlated. The paper\r\nfinishes by offering a number of recommendations to policymakers concerned with accelerating the\r\ndiffusion of voluntary environmental standards."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-29"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for EPA (ISO14000).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":80624,"dataFile":{"id":2798976,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/M68RYK/6LG1TF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/M68RYK/6LG1TF","filename":"Article for EPA (ISO14000).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":807,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153c39051e5-627d98472958","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"da5f078e994cae727c2ea3da74137c93","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"da5f078e994cae727c2ea3da74137c93"}}},{"label":"Article for EPA (ISO14000).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":80624,"dataFile":{"id":2798975,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/M68RYK/DRAXCD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/M68RYK/DRAXCD","filename":"Article for EPA (ISO14000).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":177369,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153c39056f0-75c0d56a6348","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:rJeei2KKc2ddreBnzd4VYg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0fa6733f97cda70e3ea8409ac2fa4db9","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0fa6733f97cda70e3ea8409ac2fa4db9"}}}]}}}
