Respondents were asked if they felt that   things in the United States were going in the right direction and   whether they approved of how Bush was handling the presidency, the   economy, race relations, education, and the environment. Respondents   also offered approval ratings of Congress and their own Congressional   representatives, rated the condition of the economy, and indicated   whether they were better off financially than in 1989 when George   Bush became president. In addition, respondents gave their   impressions of Bush, Bill Clinton, Ross Perot, Dan Quayle, and   television character Murphy Brown. They were also asked whether Vice   President Quayle would be qualified to take over as president if   something happened to Bush, and whether after four years of Bush a   new president was needed that could set the country in a new   direction. Concerning the 1992 presidential election, those surveyed   rated their chances of voting, indicated for whom they would vote if   the election were held the day of the interview, and commented on   whether they supported a candidate because they liked him or because   they didn't like the other candidates. Perot supporters were asked   whether they would vote for Bush or Clinton if Perot did not run, and   whether they would switch their support from Perot to one of the two   major-party candidates in November. All respondents were asked if   they thought the candidates were qualified, whether there was a   candidate for whom they would definitely not vote under any   circumstances, and whether they would be better off financially under   Bush, Clinton, or Perot. Those surveyed were also asked which   candidate would do the best job of dealing with a variety of problems   including race relations, unemployment, foreign affairs, the economy,   the environment, health care, and protecting the Social Security   system. Respondents indicated the applicability of various   characteristics to each of the candidates including strong   leadership, vision for the future, trustworthiness in a crisis,   understanding the needs of average Americans, honesty, the right   temperament to serve as president, and high moral standards. In   addition, those surveyed indicated whether the views of Bush,   Clinton, and Perot were too liberal, too conservative, or just about   right, whether they had a good idea of where the three candidates   planned to lead the nation in the next four years, and whether they   would be more o\nr less likely to support a presidential candidate who   had engaged in extramarital affairs, had never run for public office,   or had come from a wealthy, privileged background. Other topics   included assessments of the Republican and Democratic parties,   re-electing representatives in Congress, the role of the federal   government, and the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Background information   on respondents includes political alignment, voter registration   status, most recent presidential vote choice, education, age,   religion, social class, area of residence, marital status, household   composition, labor union membership, employment status, Hispanic  origin, household income, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush Administration
