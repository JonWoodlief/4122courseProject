The data consists of digitized waveforms collected with eight different microphones simultaneously from 40 subjects reading 15 sentence articles drawn from various North American business news publications. The data is partitioned into development-test and evaluation-test sets. The test sets were collected with different subjects, prompts and microphones. No training data was collected for this corpus since a substantial amount of NAB acoustic training data was already available. Index files have been included that specify the exact subset of the evaluation test recordings which were used in the November 1995 tests.
