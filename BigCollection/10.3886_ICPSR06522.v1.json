The first wave (Part 1) of this three-wave panel   survey provided baseline measures on respondents prior to the 1984   general election campaign. Topics covered general political   participation histo\nry, primary election participation, general policy   opinions, opinions regarding important national problems, and intended   vote. Additionally, the instrument included a complete battery of   demographic questions for the respondent and the respondent's spouse,   as well as standard measures of political loyalties and preferences,   such as political party identification and liberal-conservative   identification. The second pre-election wave (Parts 2 and 3) was   designed to locate respondents sociologically. The instrument included   five batteries of questions regarding respondents' neighborhoods, work   places, organizational involvements, recreational pursuits, and   families. Questions regarding the political salience of each domain   were asked, as well as a battery of questions concerning political   discussion and the respondent's reliance upon informal,   socially-derived information regarding politics. In addition to   questions about the respondent's social environments, the instrument   also included questions on candidate preference and perceptions of   candidates, expectations regarding the economy and foreign affairs, and   various policy concerns. The third wave (Parts 4 and 5) of the survey,   conducted after the 1984 election, contained sections on media use,   political party contacted by the respondent during the campaign,   participation in the campaign, voting behavior in the election, and   opinions regarding campaign issues. The standard post-election   questions were supplemented by questions regarding local politics and   local political figures, group attitudes, and respondents' social   networks. The discussant survey interviews (Part 6) elicited   information from respondents' discussion partners on campaign-related   political involvement and behaviors, political opinions, basic   demographic characteristics, and network questions. The network   questions were included primarily to investigate reciprocity in network   links for the main respondents. Demographic data collected on   participants include information on marital status, educational level,   employment status, income level, age, sex, religion, ethnic background,  nationality, and ideological stance."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.A.1.
