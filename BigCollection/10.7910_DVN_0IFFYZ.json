Therefore, violent crime is not simply determined by modernization, population\r\ncharacteristics, and cultural factors. This result follows from rigorous econometric testing based on a\r\ncross-national panel of homicide data from up to 117 countries over the period 1980â€“97. Contrary to\r\nmost existing studies, which have applied ordinary least squares on data drawn from one time period\r\nonly, this analysis uses a fixed-effects estimator with fully robust standard errors. A fixed-effects estimator\r\nelegantly controls for time-invariant determinants, such as cultural factors, and allows the\r\npooling of homicide data from otherwise incompatible sources. This is complemented by random-effects\r\nestimation in sensitivity analysis. The results suggest that economic growth, higher income levels,\r\nrespect for human rights, and the abolition of the death penalty are all associated with lower homicide\r\nrates. The same is true for democracy at high levels of democracy. The transition from autocracy to\r\ndemocracy is likely to be accompanied by a rising homicide rate, however, until full democracy has\r\nbeen reached. Results also indicate that policies aimed at improving equity have no effect on violent\r\ncrime. In particular, there is evidence that the positive effect of income inequality on homicide rates\r\nfound in many studies might be spurious. The results reported here are strikingly similar to those found\r\nfor the causes of civil war."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-04-19"}]}},"files":[{"label":"JPR homicide.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":125660,"dataFile":{"id":3013489,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/0IFFYZ/6AJHIZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0IFFYZ/6AJHIZ","filename":"JPR homicide.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":3426,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15b86328a49-08607b3a1ce8","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"ae6e3fe232f45f73348b873cd7722011","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"ae6e3fe232f45f73348b873cd7722011"}}},{"label":"JPR homicide.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":125660,"dataFile":{"id":3013490,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/0IFFYZ/TCLCZI","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0IFFYZ/TCLCZI","filename":"JPR homicide.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":188600,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15b86329242-c7c4b94fd2ff","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:pSflkQY66IBtlSze/jOBXQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"48757662dbbdd876caf13801defd11cb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"48757662dbbdd876caf13801defd11cb"}}}]}}}
