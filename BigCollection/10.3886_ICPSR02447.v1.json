The  National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects racial/ethnic  enrollment data from higher education institutions on an annual  basis. Some institutions do not report these data, and their  \"unknown\" categories have previously been distributed in direct  proportion to the \"knowns.\" This resulted in lower than accurate  figures for the racial/ethnic categories. With the advent of the  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), NCES has  attempted to eliminate this problem by distributing all  \"race/ethnicity unknown\" students through a two-stage  process. First, the differences between reported totals and  racial/ethnic details were allocated on a gender and institutional  basis by distributing the differences in direct proportion to reported  distributions. The second-stage distribution was designed to eliminate  the remaining instances of \"race/ethnicity unknown.\" The procedure  was to accumulate the reported racial/ethnic total enrollments by  state, level, control, and gender, calculate the percentage  distributions, and apply these percentages to the reported total  enrollments of institutional respondents (in the same state, level,  and control) that did not supply race/ethnicity detail. In addition,  the original \"race/ethnicity unknown\" data were also left unaltered  for those who wish to review the numbers actually distributed. The  racial/ethnic status was broken down into nonresident alien, Black  non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific  Islander, Hispanic, and White non-Hispanic. There are six data  files. Part 1, Institutional Characteristics, includes variables on  control and level of institution, religious affiliation, highest level  of offering, Carnegie classification, and state FIPS code and  abbreviation. Variables in Part 2 cover total original enrollment by  race/ethnicity and sex and by level and year of study of  student. Race/ethnicity data were not imputed for institutions that  only reported total enrollment. The \"race ethnicity unknown\"  category was not distributed among the race/ethnicity categories. In  Part 3, enrollment data are presented by race/ethnicity and sex of  student, and by level and year of study for the following selected  major field of studies: architecture, education, engineering, law,  biological/life sciences, mathematics, physical sciences, dentistry,  medicine, veterinary medicine, and business management and  administrative services. This file contains data for four-year  institutions only. Part 4 provides summary enrollment data by  adjusted race/ethnicity and sex of student and by level and year of  study of student. The \"race/ethnicity unknown\" category data were  distributed across all known race categories in this file. Also, race  data were imputed for institutions that did not report enrollment by  race. Part 5, Residence and Migration, contains enrollment data for  first-time freshmen, by state of residence. Part 6, Clarifying  Questions on Enrollments, provides information on students enrolled in  remedial courses, extension divisions, and branches of schools, and  numbers of transfer students from in-state, out of state, and other countries."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gender"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school enrollments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
