Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, inhalants, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of psychotherapeutics. Respondents were also asked about problems resulting from their use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, their perceptions of the risks involved, insurance coverage, and personal and family income sources and amounts. Demographic data include gender, race, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, household composition, and population

Unique code values (7, 8, or 9) were assigned to the recency-of-use variable when such logical imputation occurred. These code values are readily identifiable by the phrase \"... LOGICALLY IMPUTED\" in the code value descriptions. For those recency-of-use variables with missing data for which no indication of use of the drug could be found by examination of all relevant variables in the record, a code value of 91 (\"Never Used\") was assigned if there were one or more indications of such nonuse in the set of relevant variables.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Data were weighted based on the three stages of sampling that were used. The person-level sampling weight is the product of the three-stage sampling weights, each of which is equal to the inverse of the selection probability for that stage. Adjustments were made to compensate for nonresponse and sampling error. Adjustments also included trimming sample weights to reduce excessive weight variation and a post-stratification to Census population estimates.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: To protect the anonymity of respondents, all variables that could be used to identify individuals have been deleted from the public use file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For some drugs that have multiple names, questions regarding the use of that drug may be asked for each distinct name.
