In the 1978 study, a national sample was drawn that included many respondents from the 1971 study. The purpose of the study was to survey Americans about their perceived quality of life by measuring their perceptions of their socio-psychological condition, their needs and expectations from life, and the degree to which those needs were satisfied. The data, similar in scope and content\nof that in the 1971 survey, were collected via personal interviews from a nationwide probability sample of 3,692 persons 18 years of age and older during the summer of 1978. Closed and open-ended questions were used to probe respondents' satisfactions, dissatisfactions, aspirations, and disappointments in a variety of life domains, such as dwelling/neighborhood, local services (e.g., police, roads, and schools), public transportation, present personal life, life in the United States, education,\noccupation, job history/expectation, work life, housework, leisure activities, organizational affiliations, religious affiliation, health problems, financial situation, marriage (including widowhood, divorce, and separation), children/family life, and relationships with family and friends. In addition to broad questions about satisfaction with each of these domains and their importance to the respondents, specific sources of gratification and frustration were explored. Other questions focused on\nlife as a whole and about the extent to which respondents felt they had control over their lives (e.g., rating of various aspects of life, (dis)satisfaction with life, personal efficacy, and social desirability measures). A major difference between this study and the earlier study is that the 1978 respondents were asked more detailed questions concerning their perceived financial status relative to their family, friends, and past personal financial status. Personal data include sex, age, race,\nethnic background, childhood family stability, military service, and\nfather's occupation and education. Observational data are included on\nhousing and neighborhood characteristics as well as respondents'\nappearance, intelligence, and

Two independently chosen samples  were co\nmbined to form the total sample: (1) a sample of 761 segments  (clusters of approximately four housing units) selected at the overall  rate of 1 in 22,250 for the 1971 Quality of Life sample, and (2) a new  sample of 549 segments (clusters of approximately four housing units)  selected at the overall rate of 1 in 35,490 for the 1978 Quality of  Life sample. The combined samples include approximately 4,870  households (occupied housing units). Even though each of the two  samples is located in 74 primary areas, they are not in all cases the  same 74 areas. In 1971 the SMSA definitions and population counts that  determined selection probabilities were those reported for the 1960  Census. In 1972 the sample of primary areas was revised to incorporate  1970 SMSA definitions and population counts. Nine of the 1971 sample  points were dropped and nine others added in the revision process. The  1978 household sample was selected from the revised primary area  sample. When the two samples (1971 and 1978) are combined, there are  83 different sample points located in 37 states and Washington  DC. First stage stratification of SMSAs and counties was carried out  independently within each of the four major geographical regions --  Northeast, North Central, South and West -- each of which received representation in proportion to population."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Performed consistency checks."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Quality of American Life, 1978","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":40252,"dataFile":{"id":2652559,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Quality of American Life, 1978","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
