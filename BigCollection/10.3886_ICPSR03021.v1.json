The survey  was conducted just as term limits were about to be initiated in close  to 20 states. Respondents were asked how many terms they had served,  whether they supported the idea of term limits, and if they had taken  a position on term limits during their campaigns. They were also asked  about the relative influence of party leaders and staff, among others,  in determining legislative outcomes and how this influence had changed  recently. With regard to the job of legislator, respondents were  queried regarding how many bills and amendments they had authored, how  much time they spent on various duties and tasks, and if they  specialized in single policy areas. Also elicited was campaign  information regarding headquarters and staff, as well as information  on opposition, vote percentages, and campaign expenditures. Additional  questions regarding the respondent's political future were asked as  well. Former state legislators also answered questions regarding which  other offices they held, and whether they were appointed or elected to  those positions. In addition, they were asked why they departed from  the legislature, if they were likely to run for office again, what the  political background of the person who held the seat after them was,  and, if they chose not to run for re-election, the reason for that  decision. Demographic information, including gender, year of birth,  ethnicity, occupation outside of politics, income level, and religious  affiliation was also collected. Contextual information was added to  the file by the principal investigators, and includes data on state  population, the date when term limits were adopted in the state,  length of term, timing of elections, number of seats in the legislature, legislative expenditures, and legislator compensation."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"campaign issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elective offices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political campaigns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state legistlators"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state legislatures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"states (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIII.B.
