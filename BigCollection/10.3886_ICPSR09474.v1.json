In terms of the Public Use   Sample as a whole, a sample density of 1 person per 100 was chosen so   that a single sample point was randomly generated for every two census   pages. Sample points were chosen for inclusion in the collection only   if the individual selected was the first person listed in the dwelling.   Under this procedure each dwelling, family, and individual in the   population had a 1 in 100 probability of inclusion in the Public Use   Sample. The complete sample, which will be released by the principal   investigators in December 1993, will contain approximately 500,000   individuals living in 100,000 families, or 1 percent of the United  States population in 1880."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Census of Population, 1880 [United States]  Public Use Sample (1 in 1000 Preliminary Subsample)","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":36290,"dataFile":{"id":2618709,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Census of Population, 1880 [United States]  Public Use Sample (1 in 1000 Preliminary Subsample)","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
