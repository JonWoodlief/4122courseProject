This project was initiated in August 1996 when a stratified random sample of 171 farmers in Ouro Preto do Oeste was selected along with 25 households that participate in the Association of Alternative Producers (APA) to investigate the decisions of farmers using slash-and-burn agriculture and others using sustainable methods of farming. The survey questions consisted of inquiries about the household (including age, education level, farming experience, and number of farm animals owned), lot characteristics (including size and division between pasture, forest, agriculture, and agroforestry), harvest of market and subsistence crops, agricultural and other forms of income, and the use of agroforestry and major influences determining farming techniques. Questions about income derived from agriculture provided information about the harvest of all perennial and annual crops, milk harvest and meat harvest, the amount of each item that was sold, and at what price.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agriculture"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crop income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crop production"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crop value"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crops"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"deforestation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"farmers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"farms"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"livestock"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rural population"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR VI.

The sample  includes considerable variation in distance to the main road (from 0  to 90 km) as well as soil type and topography. In the initial data  collection, a random sample of 171 households, stratified by the rural  population of each of the six municipalities in the region, were  interviewed over a six-month period (August 1996 through January  1997). Jill L. Caviglia-Harris, assisted by a local farmer, conducted  each of the interviews. The distance between interviews, in terms of  lots, was designated in each municipality to represent the areas  equally and to obtain spatial variation in topography, soil type, and  distance to market. If the house was unoccupied at the time of the  interview or the owner of the lot was not available,\nthe owner of the  next house on the same side of the road was interviewed, and if the  same occurred at the next house, the owner of the next house on the  same side of the road was interviewed. This occurrence was generally  uncommon since most of the farmers stay close to, or on, their lots  during the time of year the surveys were conducted (August through  January), which ranges from the end of the burning period to the  beginning of the planting season. Data were collected from the same  farm lots in the August to November 2000 interview period. Some of the  original 171 lots were dropped from the panel data because they were  sold to land speculators who did not take up residence on the land  purchased some time during the four-year time period. This reduced the  stratified random sample to 152 households, a combined set of 304 observations across both years."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"There was only one refusal to participate in the  survey in 1996. This was in the municipality Mirante da Serra. The  high response rate is attributed to two factors: first, culturally,  Brazilians are generally very hospitable to strangers, and second,  because of the lack of contact with people, the farmers were generally  pleased to communicate with outsiders. Many of the farmers do not  leave their farms on a daily basis (especially during the rainy  season) due to a lack of transportation, long distances to city centers, and poor road conditions."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Diffusion of Sustainable Agriculture in the Amazon [Brazil]  A Panel Database, 1996-2000","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":34769,"dataFile":{"id":2607716,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Diffusion of Sustainable Agriculture in the Amazon [Brazil]  A Panel Database, 1996-2000","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
