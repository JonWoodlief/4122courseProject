Even in the absence of estrogen, ERa can be activated by growth factors, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen; however, the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown. Here we show that the EGF-induced ERa genomic targets, its cistromes, are distinct from those induced by estrogen in a process dependent on the transcription factor AP-1. The EGF-induced ERa cistrome specifically regulates genes found overexpressed in ERBB2-positive human breast cancers. This providesa potential molecular explanation for the endocrine therapy resistance seen in ERa-positive breast cancers that overexpress ERBB2. These results suggest a central role for ERa in hormone-refractory breast tumors dependent on growth factor pathway activation and favors the development of therapeutic strategies completely antagonizing ERa, as opposed to blocking its estrogen responsiveness alone.
