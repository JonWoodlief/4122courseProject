A national sample of 1,131 adults was surveyed, including an oversample of African Americans, for a total of 203 African Americans respondents. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling his job as president, and whether they approved of the way the Congress was doing its job, whether they approved of the way the Republicans in Congress and the Democrats in Congress were doing their jobs, and who respondents wanted to see in control of Congress after the next congressional election. Opinions were sought on whether things in this country were on the right track, and who could be trusted more, the Democrats or the Republicans, to do a better job handling the situation in Iraq, health care, the United States campaign on terrorism, the economy, taxes, and immigration issues. Several questions were asked about the war in Iraq, including whether the war was worth fighting,  whether the United States was making progress in restoring civil order in Iraq, whether the number of military forces should be increased, and whether United States forces in Iraq should be withdrawn immediately. Respondents were also asked how closely they were following the 2008 presidential race, for whom they would vote if the 2008 presidential primary were held that day, their opinion of the candidates, who they thought was best able to handle various situations facing the country, and their opinion of the most important issue in their choice for president. Additional topics covered whether the respondent was a feminist, whether smaller or larger governments were favored,  whether homosexual couples should be allowed to form recognized civil unions, whether giving illegal immigrants the right to legally live in the United States was supported,  whether abortion should be legal, and opinions about the nationâ€™s economy and a possible recession.  Demographic information includes voter registrat\nion status and participation history, sex, age, race, income, marital status, religious preference, religious service attendance, education level, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political philosophy, and political party affiliation."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush
