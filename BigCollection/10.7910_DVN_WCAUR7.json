The study also examined how women's military roles mirrored their civilian roles, the relationship between men and women in the 1940s, and the long-term effects of women in the military on the position/status of women in American society.\r\n<br /><br />  The sample consisted of 565 participants (100 military nurses and 465 non-nurse military personnel). The extensive 11-page questionnaire includes both open-ended and precoded questions focusing on these womens experiences in military service, relations with people in the military, pre- and postwar personal histories, current attitudes toward military service (Vietnam War/Korean War) and women's issues (ERA), community involvement, and the influence/effect of the military experience on their lives. Military nurses were also asked about their nursing experience during and after the war.\r\n<br /><br /> The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (paper data).
