This dataset contains information on every year in which a state mandated HSEEs as part of their general graduation requirements. Archival data on each states' HSEE policy was collected in order to (1) test hypotheses about the factors that have lead to the diffusion of state HSEEs over\ntime and across states, and (2) test hypotheses about the impact of state HSEEs on student academic achievement and high school graduation rates. These variables were derived from a variety of primary source materials, including public records, legal archival resources, newspaper reports, and communications with officials in state education agencies. In order to make these materials available to future users, a separate linked data file was created that (1) provides a full bibliographic reference for each piece of source material, (2) gives the three-digit unique identifier that is associated with it, and (3) provides the name of the file that houses the actual document. The data describe not only which graduating classes in which states faced these requirements, but also the level of difficulty of the HSEEs. The data cover graduating classes between the years 1977 and 2007.
