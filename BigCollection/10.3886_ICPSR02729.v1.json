Three of the eight cities originally studied by Margaret Zahn and Marc Riedel (NATURE AND PATTERNS OF HOMICIDE IN EIGHT AMERICAN CITIES, 1978 [ICPSR 8936]) were revisited for this data collection. In each city, police records were coded for each case of homicide occurring in the city each year from 1980 to 1994. Homicide data for St. Louis were provided by the St. Louis Homicide Project with Scott Decker and Richard Rosenfeld as the principal investigators. Variables describing the event cover study site, year of the case, date and time of assault, location of fatal injury, method used to kill the victim, and circumstances surrounding the death. Variables pertaining to offenders include total number of homicide and assault victims, number of offenders arrested, number of offenders identified, and disposition of event for offenders. Variables on victims focus on whether the victim was killed at work, if the victim was using drugs or alcohol, the victim's blood alcohol level, and the relationship of the victim to the offender. Demographic variables include age, sex, race, and marital status of victims and offenders."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Although homicide rates declined in many cities  in the late 1990s, the rate of homicide in cities with populations  over 250,000 increased significantly during the 1980s. In addition,  there were major changes in the characteristics of homicide. The most  striking changes involved the increase in homicide victimization and  offending among young males, especially those 18 and under. At the  same time, research on homicide has pointed to, but not fully  documented, the importance of community characteristics in relation to  changing levels of violence. Theoretical advances have suggested that  it is important to locate events in their cultural context and to  examine changes in context and the resulting patterns of violence. The  researchers undertook a multiple-city study of homicide rather than a  single-city study to allow for better generalizability regarding  patterns of homicide and circumstances that trigger changes in  patterns. Further, by examining the problem from an individual,  case-level perspective, the study sought to assess changes in volume  and types of homicide over time and to document the nature of those changes."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In an earlier study by Margaret Zahn and Marc  Riedel (NATURE AND PATTERNS OF HOMICIDE IN EIGHT AMERICAN CITIES, 1978  [ICPSR 8936]), data were collected on homicide in eight cities  representing the four regions of the United States. These sites had  representative overall patterns of homicide for large cities in their  regions. Initially, this study was to return to four of the eight  cities, with one city again representing each region: Philadelphia in  the Northeast, St.Louis in the Midwest, Dallas in the South, and  Phoenix in the West. However, Dallas was dropped and only three of the  original eight cities were retained because (1) the researchers had  maintained contact with personnel in Philadelphia, Phoenix, and  St. Louis, which facilitated securing the data fro\nm those sources, (2)  these cities had witnessed substantial increases in the homicide rate,  and each had demonstrated changes in patterns of the victim-offender  relationship, as measured by the limited Uniform Crime Report data,  and (3) cost prohibited research in more sites. In each city, police  records were coded for each case of homicide occurring in the city  each year from 1980 to 1994. Collecting information on all homicide  events rather than sampling cases had two major advantages. First,  sampling could produce inadvertent biases in types of cases and/or too  few cases of a particular type for analysis purposes. Second, analysis  of the universe of cases in each site enabled direct comparability  with databases that were collected under other auspices and included all cases over multiple years."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Selected variables salient to understanding  homicide were measured in order to examine changes in the nature of  homicide in urban areas.
