The  National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects racial/ethnic  enrollment data from higher education institutions on an annual  basis. Some institutions do not report these data, and their  \"unknown\" categories have previously been distributed in direct  proportion to the \"knowns.\" This resulted in lower than accurate  figures for the racial/ethnic categories. With the advent of the  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), NCES has  attempted to eliminate this problem by distributing all race/ethnicity  unknown students through a two-stage process. First, the differences  between reported totals and racial/ethnic details were allocated on a  gender and institutional basis by distributing the differences in  direct proportion to reported distributions. The second-stage  distribution was designed to eliminate the remaining  \"race/ethnicity\" unknowns. The procedure was to accumulate the  reported racial/ethnic total enrollments by state, level, control, and  gender, calculate the percentage distributions, and apply these  percentages to the reported total enrollments of institutional  respondents (in the same state, level, and control) that did not  supply race/ethnicity detail. In addition, the original \"race  unknown\" data were also left unaltered for those who wish to review  numbers actually distributed. The racial/ethnic status was broken down  into nonresident alien, Black non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan  Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and White  non-Hispanic. There are four data files. Part 1, Institutional  Characteristics, includes variables on control and level of  institution, religious affiliation, highest level of offering,  Carnegie classification, and state FIPS codes and abbreviation. Part 2  covers Enrollment Data by Race/Ethnicity and Sex and by Level and Year  of Study, while the focus of Part 3 is Enrollment Data by Age  Categories and by Sex and Level of Student.  Part 4, Clarifying  Questions on Enrollments, provides information on students enrolled in  remedial courses, extension divisions, and branches of schools, and  numbers of transfer students from in-state, out-of-state, and other countries."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gender"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school enrollments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
