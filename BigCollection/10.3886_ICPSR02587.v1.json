Survey data were obtained from students, teachers, and principals in each of the 44 junior and senior high schools in a county in Ohio that agreed to participate in the study. The data represent roughly a six-month time frame. Students in grades 7 through 12 were anonymously surveyed in February 1994. The Student Survey (Part 1) was randomly distributed to approximately half of the students in all classrooms in each school. The other half of the students received a different survey that focused on drug use among students (not available with this collection). The teacher (Part 2) and principal (Part 3) surveys were completed at the same time as the student survey. The principal survey included both closed-ended and open-ended questions, while all questions on the student and teacher surveys were closed-ended, with a finite set of answers from which to choose. The three questionnaires were designed to gather respondent demographics, perceptions about school discipline and control, information about weapons and gangs in the school, and perceptions about school crime, including personal victimization and responses to victimization. All three surveys asked whether the school had a student court and, if so, what sanctions could be imposed by the student court for various forms of student misconduct. The student survey and teacher surveys also asked about the availability at school of various controlled drugs. The student survey elicited information about the student's fear of crime in the school and on the way to and from school, avoidance behaviors, and possession of weapons for protection. Data were also obtained from the principals on each school's suspension/expulsion rate, the number and type of security guards and/or devices used within the school, and other school safety measures. In addition to the surveys, census data were acquired for a one-quarter-mile radius around each participating school's campus, providing population demographics, educational attainment, employment status, marital status, income levels, and area housing information. Also, arrest statistics for six separate crimes (personal crime, property crime, simple assault, disorderly conduct, drug/alcohol offenses, and weapons offenses) for the reporting district in which each school was located were obtained from local police departmen\nts. Finally, the quality of the immediate neighborhood was assessed by means of a \"windshield\" survey in which the researchers conducted a visual inventory of various neighborhood characteristics: type and quality of housing in the area, types of businesses, presence of graffiti and gang graffiti, number of abandoned cars, and the number and perceived age of pedestrians and people loitering in the area.

While no  consensus exists on the size of the problem, the results of every  investigation have revealed that a large number of students are  victimized at school. Coupled with the fact that students are required  to attend school, these results make the issue of in-school  victimization a priority concern for students, parents, educators, and  the criminal justice system. This concern has led to calls for greater  discipline and control through diverse mechanisms such as using armed  security guards and metal detectors and establishing profit-making  schools. However, discipline and control may also be achieved through  a variety of more humanistic, normative methods rather than the  imposition of coercive measures -- for example, student participation  in policy-making, particularly in relation to school rules,  regulations, and sanctions. While concern over safety in schools has  grown dramatically, no consensus exists on the impact of various forms  of discipline and control to eliminate or curtail in-school  victimization. This study gathered evidence on the relationship  between discipline and the control of victimization in schools and  investigated the effectiveness of humanistic versus coercive  disciplinary measures. The study focused on four hypotheses: (1)  School discipline and control measures are negatively related to  levels of in-school victimization. This hypothesis assumes that  changes in discipline and control precede changes in victimization  based on the common assumption that victimization levels respond to  discipline and control efforts (or the lack thereof) rather than the  reverse. (2) More humanistic/consensual discipline/control measures  have a greater negative impact on in-school victimization than do  coercive/custodial measures. (3) The community environment has a  strong impact on the level of in-school victimization. (4) The  presence of gangs in the school is positively related to the level of in-school victimization."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Survey data were obtained from students, teachers,  and principals in each of the 44 junior and senior high schools in a  county in Ohio that agreed to participate in the study.
