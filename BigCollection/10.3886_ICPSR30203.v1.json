A national sample of 1,000 adults was surveyed. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way Barack Obama was handling the presidency, the economy, health care, and the federal budget deficit, and whether they thought the country was headed in the right direction. Respondents were queried on whether they approved of the way the United States Congress was doing its job, whether they approved of the way Nancy Pelosi was handling her job as Speaker of the House, whether they approved of the way Harry Reid was handling his job as Majority Leader, and which party they trust more to do a better job in coping with the main problems the nation faces over the next few years. Respondents were asked whether they supported or opposed the changes to the health care system that have been enacted by Congress and the Obama Administration, whether they have health insurance, whether they thought health care costs would increase or decrease as a result of the changes to the health care system, and whether they thought these changes to the health care system would increase or decrease the federal budget deficit. Information was collected on whether the respondents thought the health care plan created too much government involvement in the nation's health care system, whether respondents had a good basic understanding of the upcoming changes to the health care system, whether respondents have contacted their senators or representatives in Congress about the health care reform, and whether they thought these changes to the health care system represent a major change in the direction of the country. Respondents were queried on whether they would vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in the upcoming election for United States House of Representatives, whether respondents thought it would be a good thing or a bad thing if control of Congress switched from Democrats to Republican, whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Tea party, and Sarah Palin. Finally respondents were asked a number of question about the United States Post office, whether they thought the post office would still be used by most people at the end of the century, and whether respondents thought abortion should be legal or illegal in all cases. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, household income, education level, political party affiliation, political philosophy, political ideology, religious preference, and whether the respondent is a born-again Christian."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Afghanistan

To achieve greater consistency and reduce the chance of large weights, ABC News in 2007 tested and evaluated iterative weighting, commonly known as raking or rim weighting, in which the sample is weighted sequentially to Census targets one variable at a time, continuing until the optimum distribution across variables (again, age, race, sex, and education) is achieved. ABC News adopted rim weighting in January 2008.
