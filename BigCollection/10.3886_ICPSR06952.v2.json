Respondents were asked to rate the health risk to themselves and their families, and to individuals from their country, from various external sources (power plants, power lines, AIDS, street drugs, nuclear waste). Questions were also asked of respondents regarding perceived health risk from natural sources (storms and floods), environmental sources (air quality, climate change, ozone level, pollution), and other sources (smoking, stress, x-rays). Other items focused on the importance of key problems facing society today, such as decline in moral values, lack of national leadership, economic troubles, and environmental problems. In ad\ndition, respondents were asked for their level of agreement with statements concerning environmental health problems, health risks, and the need for nuclear power and alternative power sources, as well as general statements regarding attitudes and philosophies about technology, politics, economics, and other issues. Demographic questions including age, gender, education level, area of study, and personality traits were also asked."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
