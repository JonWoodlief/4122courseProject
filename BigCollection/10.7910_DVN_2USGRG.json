The survey aims at testing attitudes towards alternative European Unemployment Benefit Schemes (EUBS). We model different EUBSs as varying across 6 dimensions: the size of the programme, country-level conditionality, impact on cross-country redistribution, impact on taxation, level of administration, and individual-level conditionality. Each of these dimensions has multiple levels; there is a total of 324 alternative combinations. Each respondent is confronted with randomly selected pairs and he/she is asked to (1) pick the preferred combination, and (2) report how much each combination is liked or disliked (independently from each-other). The experiment is repeated three times. \r\nThe Survey is carried out in 13 countries: NL, BE, FR, ES, IT, AT, DE, PL, DK, EE, FI, HU, IE. The countries have been selected so to ensure variation in (1) welfare state models, (2) economic performance over the last 10 years, (3) geographical location, (4) Euro Area membership. The full survey will include a new sample of 1500 individuals in each of the 13 surveyed countries. At the moment of this pre-registration, the fieldwork is yet to begin.
