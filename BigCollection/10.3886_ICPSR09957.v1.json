Questions concerning consumer goods asked whether respondents  read product information before purchasing, what additional product  information they would like to see, what three things other than price  were most important in deciding whether to purchase an item, and  whether it was necessary to have the same type of product information  available for all members of the European Community (EC). Respondents'  attitudes and opinions on Social Security were probed with questions  that asked whether they agreed that Social Security properly protects  the unemployed, the elderly, the sick or disabled, those with  work-related injuries or illness, and the poor. Respondents were also  asked whether policies on pensions, minimum income, and unemployment  should be decided by national governments or by the EC, and whether  foreigners should have the same Social Security benefits as citizens.  The general health of respondents and their health care benefits were  assessed through questions that asked whether they had a long-standing  illness, disability, or infirmity, whether they had cut down their  activity due to illness or injury, and whether they had taken medicine  or talked to a doctor within the last 30 days. Respondents were also  queried about which conditions they would see a doctor for and what  type of examinations they had had in the past three years. Respondents  were asked to rate what they paid for various medical services, the  general quality of their health care, and the nature and availability  of health insurance. The main problems facing the elderly and the role  the elderly play in society were also topics of investigation in this  survey. Questions elicited respondents' views toward possible changes  in pension terms, whether retirement should occur at a fixed age, what  types of discrimination affect the elderly who are working, whether  the government should introduce laws to try to stop age  discrimination, whether a minimum level of income should be provided  to the elderly, and whether the elderly needing personal care should  go into residential/nursing homes or should have social services help  them remain in their homes for as long as possible. Respondents were  also asked whether they provided long-term care to anyone either  living with them or not living with them, who was in the best position  to decide which services are most important for the elderly, what the  best method of financing long-term care for the elderly was, and  whether the EC was doing enough with regard to the elderly. Questions  on retirement dealt with what ages respondents retired/planned to  retire, whether the retired felt their pensions to be adequate,  whether working people looked forward to retiring, whether pensions  should be extended to widows and dependent children, whether pensions  should be reduced for those who work for earned income beyond  retirement, and whether pensions should be provided through government  taxation, employer/employee contributions, or private contracts  between workers and pension companies. Queries about alcohol and drug  usage probed the use of beer, wine, spirits, and other forms of  alcohol, age at which the respondent began drinking, familiarity with  major forms of drugs, age at which drugs were first offered, how  difficult it was to get drugs, and the means available for getting  drugs. Additional questions focused on how the respondent viewed the  drug problem, the top priority in eliminating the drug problem,  diminishing the effects of drug use, whether drug use leads to AIDS,  prostitution, health problems, social problems, violence, suicide,  personality breakdowns, and problems with the law, and the major  reasons for alcohol and drug use. Demographic and other background  information was gathered on life satisfaction, number of people  residing in the home, si\nze of locality, home ownership, trade union  membership, region of residence, and occupation of the head of  household, as well as the respondent's age, sex, marital status,  education, occupation, work sector, religiosity, subjective social  class, use of media, left-right political self-placement, and opinion leadership."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"age
