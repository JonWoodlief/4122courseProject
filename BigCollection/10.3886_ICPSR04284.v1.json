The  data contain the results of the three popular referenda on Black civil  equality held in 1857, 1868, and 1880 in the state of Iowa: the first  just prior to the onset of the Civil War, the second following the  Civil War, and the third coming at the close of the Reconstruction  period. In order to provide a more comprehensive political context for  these well-spaced referenda, the data files contain all relevant  annual elections occurring in Iowa between August 1848 and June 1882,  capturing the period of time beginning with the first elections  involving antislavery candidates through the end of Reconstruction. In  addition, the data contain the results of various other referenda,  including banking and liquor prohibition referenda voted upon during  the time period. Parts 1 and 2 contain county-level data for all 99  Iowa counties. Part 1, County File: Elections and Referenda, contains  the outcomes for the various elections and referenda that were put to  the vote in Iowa during the mid- to late-1800s. Part 2, County File:  Miscellaneous, contains various characteristics describing the voting  Iowan population including religion and occupation data. Parts 3 and 4  contain township-level data. The data contain results from 186 of 292  Iowa townships that had surviving 1857 referenda returns. Of the 186,  127 townships had records for all three of the referenda regarding the  rights of Blacks (1857, 1868, and 1880). As a result, Part 3, Township  File: Referenda, contains the outcomes, by township, for the three  civil rights referenda voted on in the state of Iowa. Part 4, Township  File: Voters, contains hand counted voter birthplace data keyed to each of the three referenda."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"African Americans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"American Civil War"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Black White relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil rights"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"counties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"historical data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legislation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nineteenth century"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"racial attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Reconstruction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"referendum"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter turnout"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting rights"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.

There  were a total of 292 counties in Iowa, however data concerning the 1857  referenda on Black suffrage was only available for 186 counties.  These counties are sometimes referred to within the study as the \"186  subfile.\" Furthermore, of these 186 counties found in Parts 3 and 4,  127 of them contained data for all three of the Black suffrage  referenda that were voted upon in 1857, 1868, and 1880. These counties  are referred to as the \"127 subfile.\" Furthermore, of these 186  counties found in Parts 3 and 4, 127 of them contained data for all  three of the Black suffrage referenda that were voted upon in 1857,  1868, and 1880. These counties are referred to as the \"127 subfile.\"  (2) Per the author, since the estimated \"Nonvoters\" variables are  arithmetic calculations, they occasionally are represented as minus  numbers. This simply means that the number of actual voters exceeded  the number of estimated eligible voters. These negative numbers are  usually small and do not pose a systematic error in the data. (3) The  author also points out that it will be seen that some entries take the  form of large even numbers (e.g., 200, 300, 700). These are obviously  estimates made by county-seat election officials for losing candidates  in lopsided elections. At the time, there were no partisan  poll-watchers demanding an exact count. Such entries are not serious  errors, since they are not systematic. In any event, they are, given  present knowledge, the only extant data, and can only be utilized or  excluded as the user sees fit. (4) The author notes that the data does  not include the sometimes useful \"Ineligibles\" variable, employed in  comparisons of any two sets of election data, that designates new  voters coming into the electorate since the first of the compared  elections. It is calculated by subtracting the first election's  Estimated Eligible Voters (EEV) from that of the second. (5) For the  purposes of this study, voters are defined as adult, male citizens of  the United States.
