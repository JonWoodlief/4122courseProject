For the October 1974 Cross-Section survey,  2,365 British electors were interviewed, of which 1,674 had also been  interviewed in the February 1974 cross-section, although this is NOT a  panel file. As with other surveys in the series, electors in Northern  Ireland and the Scottish Highlands and Islands were excluded from the  sampling frame. Interviewed in October 1974 (and stretching to January  1975 in order to boost the response rate), respondents answered  questions relating to the mass media (e.g., attention to newspapers  and television and perceived bias in newspapers), their first and  second choices in the October 1974 general election, and their  opinions of the Conservative, Labour, Liberal, Scottish Nationalist,  and Plaid Cymru political parties (e.g., perceived difference among  parties, knowledge of party position/record, party identification, and  the strength of party preference). Respondents also were asked for  their views on a range of social issues relating to domestic and  foreign affairs, with emphasis on the economy and the Common  Market. Respondents were then asked how the parties stood on each  issue, and how much that influenced the respondent's vote. Some of the  issues include rising prices, strikes, unemployment, pensions,  housing, North Sea oil, taxation, the Common Market, social services,  nationalization, wage controls, and the amount of power held by unions  and by big business. Respondents were also asked for their attitudes  about their personal financial status, change/getting ahead, life in  general, today's standards, local government, their own occupation,  and the government's achievements. They also gave their predictions  for Britain's future economy and of the outcome of the October  election, and compared Britain's government and industry with those of  Europe. Respondents were asked if they felt the following had gone too  far: sex and race equality, police handling of demonstrations, law  breakers, pornography, modern teaching methods, abort\nion, welfare  benefits, and military cuts. Respondents were then asked to agree or  disagree with the suggestions that government should: establish  comprehensives, increase cash to health service, repatriate  immigrants, control land, increase foreign aid, toughen on crime,  control pollution, give workers more say, curb Communists, spend on  poverty, redistribute wealth, decentralize power, and preserve the  countryside. Background information includes age, sex, marital status,  place of residence during childhood, subjective class, forced  subjective class, family class, tenure, type and length of residence,  employment status, degree of responsibility in and training for job  (respondent and spouse), experience of unemployment in household,  income, trade union membership (respondent and spouse), and socioeconomic group."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic
