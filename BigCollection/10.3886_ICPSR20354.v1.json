These data were organized into monthly  increments to capture the occurrence of both short-term and long-term  changes in filing patterns and to provide a sufficient number of data  points to conduct the analysis. The trends in\ncivil rights suits filed  (Dataset 1) and habeas corpus petitions filed (Dataset 2) were  measured by the number of petitions filed per 10,000 state  prisoners. Prison population size was used in calculating a filing  rate because the number of prisoners was the pool from which potential  filers arose.
