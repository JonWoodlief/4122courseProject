The later time point was 1989 for all states except Georgia,   for which it was 1990. In all but two of the states, only cities with a   Black population of 10 percent or more were examined. Exceptions were   Texas, where a combined Black and Hispanic population of 10 percent was   the threshold, and North Carolina, where a combined Black and American   Indian population threshold of 10 percent was used. Data were collected   in each state for cities over a certain size, using 1980 United States Census   figures. The po\npulation threshold was 1,000 in Mississippi, 2,500 in   Louisiana, 6,000 in Alabama, and 10,000 in Georgia, Texas, and South   Carolina. In North Carolina all incorporated cities were examined,   including cities with a population of less than 500.
