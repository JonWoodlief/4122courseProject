Yet more notable are the differences,\r\nwith several political economy factors which\r\nhave a statistically significant influence on countries’ level\r\nof compliance with existing smoke-free laws in public\r\nplaces found not to consistently influence their propensity\r\nto adopt bans in the first place. Possible explanations for\r\nthis discrepancy are that governments are motivated to\r\nadopt smoking bans for reasons other than protecting the\r\nhealth of their citizens and that the real costs of smoking\r\nbans are predominantly borne at the compliance stage.\r\n\r\nConclusions More effort needs to be made to ensure that\r\ngovernments realize their existing policy commitments\r\nthrough effective enforcement of bans."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-31"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for IJPH (smoking).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":80697,"dataFile":{"id":2799334,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/9LAULC/BXDF7L","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9LAULC/BXDF7L","filename":"Article for IJPH (smoking).do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":14908,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153ce2be669-0781db67bd79","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e799b749db92ed43681481c0d3cba881","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e799b749db92ed43681481c0d3cba881"}}},{"label":"Article for IJPH (smoking).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":80697,"dataFile":{"id":2799335,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/9LAULC/7GHYJ1","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/9LAULC/7GHYJ1","filename":"Article for IJPH (smoking).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":48316,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:153ce2be9aa-536f65ff6263","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:lB4wmk7+W//tHIwHD6RJuA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"83461e55dcf04e2992aaa081bf490957","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"83461e55dcf04e2992aaa081bf490957"}}}]}}}
