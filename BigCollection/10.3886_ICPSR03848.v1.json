Simpson and domestic   violence. Respondents were asked whether they had\nheard about the   case involving O.J. Simpson, whether they previously admired O.J.   Simpson, whether they had lost their admiration for him, and if they   still admired him for his previous accomplishments. Views were sought   on how serious the problem of domestic violence was in the United   States, whether police, prosecutors, judges, and laws were too tough   or not tough enough in combating spouse abuse, and whether   respondents would support or oppose a proposed law requiring police   to arrest anyone seriously suspected of spouse abuse, even if the   victim did not want to press charges. Respondents were also polled on   whether they or a close friend or relative had ever been physically   abused by their partner, how often it occurred, whether it was still   continuing, whether it was reported to the police, whether the   respondent was injured, and whether the abuser was arrested. Other   topics addressed respondents' interest in professional football.  Background variables include sex, age, and ethnicity."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"domestic violence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Simpson, O.J."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
