According to Survey of Young People in Egypt (SYPE) 2014, 21.1% of married female youth aged 25-29 in Egypt were married before 18 while 33.3% of young women residing in rural Upper Egypt were reported to be married before 18.  Early marriage deprives a girl of education and employment opportunities and places her at risk of early and repeat pregnancy, gender based violence (GBV) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  The present study examines sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs of married adolescent girls (MAGs) in rural Upper Egypt and identifies key contextual and cognitive factors that could mitigate or exacerbate the effects of early marriage on MAGs sexual and reproductive health.
