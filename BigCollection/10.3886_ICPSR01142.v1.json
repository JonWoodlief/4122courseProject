In  turn, they cause concurrences and dissents to fluctuate around a  common level. If consensual norms are a substantial influence on the  behavior of the Court, the long-run extent of concurrence and dissent  on the Court will covary substantially, and will do so to varying  degrees under different Chief Justices. To test their hypotheses, the  authors used cointegration and error-correction analyses of the  number of Supreme Court cases with concurring and dissenting opinions,  from 1800 to 1991. Because of the dramatic\nincrease in concurrences  and dissents during the 1940s, they made use of recently-developed  methods for detecting cointegrating relationships in the presence of  structural breaks. Consistent with expectations, dissents and  concurrences moved together over time. Thus consensual norms appeared  to influence substantially both concurrences and dissents on the  Court. The effects of such norms vary in the long term under different Chief Justices."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court decisions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court justices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Supreme Court"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
