Additionally, GTD data for the years since and including 1998 were gathered retrospectively, likely leading to a more conservative number of attacks than if sufficient data had been gathered at the time of the attack. Because this study was conducted using open source technology terrorist events occurring in certain areas of the world may not have received as extensive news coverage as other more visible events.

Palestinian terrorist attacks were defined in this research as cases involving a minimum of one Israeli target in either Israel or the Palestinian territories. Attacks, documented in the GTD, against such targets that lack information about the perpetrators (30.2%) are assumed by this study to have been Palestinian related.  Israeli actions towards non-state actors were found by utilizing Textual Analysis by Augmented Replacement Instructions (TABARI) to search Reuters articles from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 2004 for articles containing the search term \"Israel.\" These results were filtered again to include only articles relating to Israeli government actions, both conciliatory and repressive, towards non-state actors. To determine if actions were conciliatory or repressive, from the Palestinian perspective, the \"Seven-Point Guide for the Conciliatory-Repression Scale\" was developed. Data were also auto coded to reflect whether the action was discriminate or indiscriminate. The data were then divided into four temporally based sets, (1)most of the 211 months in the period with the exception of the twelve months in 1993 for which the GTD lacks data, the first four months of 1994 as they are dependent on the missing 1993 data, and the first four months of the data set because they are dependent on data outside the scope of this study; (2) those months during the First Intifada (December 1987-August 1993); (3) those months during the Oslo Lull (September 1993-August 2000); and (4) those months during the Second Intifada."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Record abstracts"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43254,"dataFile":{"id":2424109,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":192408,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:92103","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9689482ce47574d5bcded73e44922b61","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9689482ce47574d5bcded73e44922b61"}}},{"description":"","label":"Data.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43254,"dataFile":{"id":2424108,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":38389,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:92102","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","originalFileSize":26794,"UNF":"UNF:5:jPRWAw/AaA2llTkaFQJfPg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e830fabacfdcb2e8d0a10bc55ab7ac40","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e830fabacfdcb2e8d0a10bc55ab7ac40"}}}]}}}
