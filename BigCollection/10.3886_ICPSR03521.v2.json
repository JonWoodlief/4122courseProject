Additional questions focused on respondents' knowledge and opinions about the EU, including how well-informed they felt about the EU, what sources of information about the EU they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EU member, and the extent of their personal interest in EU matters. Another major focus of the surveys was EU enlargement. Respondents were asked about their opinions in regard to how well-informed they felt about EU enlargement, which countries they favor to join the EU, the effects of enlargement, and EU decision-making among the member states after enlargement. The second major focus of the surveys was the European Parliament (EP). Those polled were asked about their voting practices for different types of elections, likes and dislikes about the EP, the effects of government activities and decisions, and their exposure to information about the EP through media or personal contact with the EP, as well as their interest in obtaining mor\ne information about the EP. For the final major focus, the euro, certain respondents were asked to provide their opinion about the replacement of national currencies with the euro, the future effects of the introduction of the euro, and their comfort in using the euro. For respondents in countries where the euro was introduced, the poll solicited their opinions regarding price display in euros and in their national currency, and need for these indicators, and queried them about their methods and practices in converting prices between these currencies. Respondents were also asked their opinion about the attributes of euro notes and coinage, the rounding of prices, and their experience in using the euro and with the changeover from their national currency to the euro. In addition, the survey asked respondents to identify who helped them most during the introduction of the euro, to estimate the cost of certain items in euros, and whether they had heard about or benefited from a Euro information campaign directed towards disabled citizens. Respondents were also asked about the presence of foreign coins in their country, their attachment to the euro or their national currency, and their identity as a European in using the euro. For certain countries, respondents were asked whether they had seen the euro logo in shops, and whether the presence of the logo had affected their confidence in the store. Other survey questions included whether respondents were afraid of organized crime and certain disaster situations, as well as particular scenarios in relation to EU enlargement, whether decision-making about select issues should be done by a member country alone or jointly with the EU, and whether the EU should develop a constitution, as well as common foreign, defense, and security policies. In addition, respondents were asked about their opinion regarding the electoral processes of the EU government and member states, and tax revenue, while respondents in Spain were asked about the EU presidency. Demographic and other background information collected includes respondent age, gender, nationality, marital status, left-right political self-placement, age when stopped full-time education, household income, occupation, type and size of community, region of residence, and language of interview."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen
