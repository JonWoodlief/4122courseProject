In  the  day context,  all  types  of  libraries  viz:  academic,  public  and  special  are  not  only providing printed resources to their library users rather they provide printed, electronic  as  well  as  other  Internet  resources  like  e-books  and  databases  for fulfilling the day to day academic and research requirements of the library users.\r\n\r\nThe challenge, the present society faces in the 21st century is keeping pace with the rapid developments in the information and communication technology, one needs to continuously upgrade their knowledge and skills. It is understood that we live in an information rich society where the amount of information and knowledge in the present world is increasing at a tremendous pace. Information\r\nliteracy is the ability to evaluate information across the range information needed, locate, synthesize and using the information effectively, using technology, communication networks and electronic resources. Information literacy includes the full range of experience, and the user needs to enable the use of information literacy. \r\nPeople who are not fond of reading will agree with the fact that a library is the most peaceful place on the earth. Library is like corpora of knowledge. One could find books in a library in almost all topics, like history, geography, or even science e-fiction.  Libraries are considered as the shrine where all the relics of the ancient  saints,  full of true virtue,  and that without  delusion  or imposture,  are preserved.  A library is like the whole world encompassed in one room.  Without a library an institution will not be complete.  It is very essential to the education and any problem,  any query  unanswered  one can find it in one of the books stored in the library.   Libraries are an integral part of the education system and one is incomplete without the other.   A well- stocked library is an asset to any institution. .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA library is a place where not only books but also magazines, journals and newspapers are well – stocked for the benefit of the readers.  Besides this one can also get the entire charts, Encyclopedia, government gazette, etc.    A reader can either read in the library or borrow the book / journal of his choice and take it to home.   The library  is a popular  place  in the academic  curriculum.    With the growing  popularity  of internet,  the retrieval  of information  becomes  faster. In view of the above facts, it is apparent that a library is a very important place in the society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries are the repositories of knowledge form of an integral part of education.  The primary objective of the library is to organize and provide access to information.  This objective will never change but the format and methods that are \r\nused  will  change  dramatically,   providing   new  opportunities   and  challenges. Libraries have witnessed a great metamorphosis in recent years.    Print medium is increasingly  giving  way  to  the  electronic  form  of  materials.     Library  is  an extremely important entity in an ever- changing society and it must be responsive to the needs of society.  Information Technology (IT) has changed the complexion of today’s libraries.  Libraries have evolved to become information provider rather than  mere  document  providers.     The shift  from  the traditional  libraries  to the digital  is  not  merely  a  technological  evolution,  but  requires  a  change  in  the paradigm by which the users access and interact with information.  This move from traditional to electronic library also alters the fundamental role of library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1  IMPACT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNCIATON TECHNOLOGY ON MODERN LIBRARIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advances in networking and communication  technology  have made the information  services available to the users on their desktop.   In the era of networked information, internet, the largest worldwide networks, has emerged as the most powerful tool for an instant access to information.  Information at nano seconds of time to end user at any time and at any place in the world.  Today’s users can no longer depend on conventional information sources to cope up with the  latest  developments  in  their  respective  fields.    E  –  Resources  are  now emerging as vital source of information for all recent and emerging thoughts and ideas coming into existence in whatever area of research.  Emergence of internet and  World  Wide  Web  (WWW)  has  provided  a  platform  to  display  these \r\nresources  globally.    The  features  inbuilt  in  the  search  and  retrieval  of  these resources have made the usage to the maximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) has a major impact on materials for search.  ICT can provide the enhanced forms of research resources, as e-resources’ and is changing the shape of both the primary resources like texts, images  and  data,  and  secondary   resources   like  catalogues.     Libraries   are subscribed to various bibliographic and full text databases which are of interest to the users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries  have changed  its face with the emergence  of ICT.   They have assumed the role of educators, train the users to find, evaluate and the usage of information in the library and also through electronic networks.   Libraries have been using ICT in general and computer technology in particular, to automate a wide ranges of administrative and technical processes and provide better services to their users.  ICT has helped the library and information science professionals in conquering  space and time and rendered  it possible  to retrieve  information from  any  corner  of  the  world  instantaneously  and  provide  it  to  the  users efficiently   and  effectively.      In  an  age  of  information   explosion,   ICT  is progressively  replacing  the old methods of information  collection,  storage and retrieval.  Academic Library System is a major beneficiary of ICT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation is knowledge, facts or data.  For the purpose of enabling the users to assimilate information, it should be repacked.   Knowledge becomes information when it is externalized i.e., put into the process of communication. \r\nThe effectiveness of communication technology depends how well it provides its clients with information rapidly, economically and authentically.  A large number of ICT enabled service including OPAC. E-resources,  etc. are available in the academic library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2   E-LIBRARY / DIGITAL LIBRARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn  e-library  or  Digital  library  is  a  physical  site  and/  or  website  that provide  around  the  clock  online  access  to digitized  audio,  video,  and  written material.   It provides free copies of books, journals etc. available to the users. Normally  these materials  are classics which have no copyright  digital formats (as opposed to print, microform, or other media) and accessible by computers. The digital content  may be stored  locally,  or accessed  remotely  via computer networks.   A digital library is a type of information  retrieval  system.   Digital Libraries are increasingly popular research area that encompasses more than traditional information retrieval or database methods and techniques.   There are many numbers of definitions.\r\n\r\nAn e- library  is the electronic  information,  library  organizers  usage  of catalog,  tag  and  search  books  and  journals.    It  maintains  a  database  as  the collection of e-materials and provides services in digital form.   Many libraries traditionally have been repositories of local information and heritage document such  as  manuscripts,  rare  books,  maps,  photographs  and  paintings,  etc.    In university  libraries,  documents  generated  in  –house  such  as  dissertation  and theses, research reports etc. represents the intellectual strength of the institution. Libraries  are  developing  digital  repositories  of  such  resourced  and  providing \r\naccess to internet or intranet access to these.  Large public and academic libraries also  provide  up  to  date  local  information  via  internet.  Digital  libraries  are  a natural  progression  from  electronic  document  sharing.    The  main  benefit  of digital library is the ability to provide around the clock, remote access to high- demand or restricted materials for multiple concurrent users.  Setting up a digital library  can  either  be  done  by  using  ‘off-the-shelf’  digital  library  products, document  management  products  or  library  management  products  capable  of digital  library  management  or  in-house  system  development  by  using  open archives software.  A simple definition of digital library is ‘a library consisting of digital  materials  and  services’.    Digital  materials  are  items  that  are  stored, processed  and  transferred  via  digital  (binary)  devices  and  network.    Digital library   services   are  information   services   that  are  delivered   digitally   over computer networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2.1    Advantages of E- Library\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   E-library is the easiest to use the available online research tool.\r\n\r\n2.   Standards searching help the educators to integrate the technology into the curriculum, by increasing the technology literacy.\r\n3.   Students  can  use the search  by  topic  feature  to retrieve  a manageable amount of quality content, quickly and easily.\r\n4.   Public libraries need to offer an easy –to-use research solution to patrons.\r\n\r\n5.   Point-and-click functionality ensures all the users finding the information they need. \r\n6.   Reference  desk gives the integrated  access to dictionary,  encyclopedia, almanacs, and much more.\r\n7.   Visually impaired people are no longer disabled in searching and surfing information on digital library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a number of reasons for building digital libraries such as, information explosion, dwindling budgets of the library, space problem, high information  demand,  available  technologies  etc.    The  other  major  points, which compel us for digitization of present day libraries, are,\r\n\r\n1.   Documents   and  other   materials   hashed   in  the  collection   of traditional libraries are deteriorating at a rapid rate.\r\n2.   Libraries  with  unique  collection  of  manuscripts  and  archived should be digitized so that these rare materials should be available for extensive access throughout.\r\n3.   Digital  Library  Technology  is  to  manage  the  large  amount  of digital contents such as thousands of images, audio clips etc.\r\n4.   Vast  amount  of information  being  created  and  stored  each  day makes it more difficult to find specific information later.   There are electronic  tools,  which  enable  this  to be dome  quickly  and easily by text search and also by the actual searching on the closer texture and even in shapes in images.\r\n5.   Digital  libraries  enable  greater  access to the content.   They are capable  of  managing  the  content  from  multiple  locations  and provide a way to enrich teaching and learning environment from the distance. \r\n6.   The information available on the web is not uniformly distributed and only a small portion of which exists in print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2.2    Functional Components of Digital Library\r\n\r\n\r\nThough diverse varieties of digital libraries are being developed  today, most   of   them   share   a   few   common   functional   components.      A   basic understanding of the key functional components will help in developing digital library.  The key components are briefly discussed below;\r\n\r\nSelection  and acquisition  - Typical process covered in this component include the selection of document to be added, digitization and/ or conversion of these documents to appropriate digital form.\r\n\r\nOrganization – Key process involved in this component include the assignment of metadata (e.g. bibliographic information) to each document being added to the collection.\r\n\r\nIndexing and storage- This component carries out indexing and storage of documents and metadata, for efficient search and retrieval.\r\n\r\nRepository – This is the digital library front-end used by the end-users to browse,  search,  retrieve  and view  the contents  of the digital  library.   This  is typically presented to the  users as an HTML page.\r\n\r\nDigital library website- This is the server computer that hosts the digital library collection, and presents the collection to the user in the form of a website home page.  The user selects a suitable link on this page to go to the search and retrieval front-end mentioned above. The digital library delivers the content based \r\non search and retrieval operations.   The digital library home page itself may be integrated with the library website through an appropriate hypertext link.\r\n\r\nNetwork connectivity – For online access, the digital library website computer should have dedicated connection to the intranet and/ or internet, depending on the target user community, access may be restricted to the intranet (organizational LAN) or extended to the external users through the internet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 E.-LEARNING\r\n\r\n\r\nE-learning is one of the fastest growing technologies and will continue its trend far into the future.  The  aim  of  e-learning  is  to  improve  the  quality of  learning   experience   for   students.   American   society   for   training   and development  (ASTD)     defines     e-learning     as     teaching     and     learning delivered,   enabled   or mediated purpose of learning. E-learning is a form of learning that uses network for delivery.  It is also known as distributed learning, distance learning and technology enabled learning. E-learning is empowering a paradigm shift from the traditional classroom to network based digital learning environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.1 Digital Libraries and e-Learning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the natural responses to the challenges of e-learning environment is  the  introduction  of  the  digital  library  to  support  e-learning  with  resources network,  designed  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  learners,  in  both  individual  and \r\ncollaborative settings, constructed to enable the dynamic use of a broad array of materials  for  learning  primarily  in  digital  format,  and  managed  actively  to promote the reliable access anytime and anywhere to quality collections and services, available both within and outside the network.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of digital libraries into the education process was made easier  by  distance  education,  which  has  developed  over  the  years.  With  the internet and the World Wide Web, distance education programs can mount sets of materials on web servers to support online courses. One of the basic ideas is to aggregate the learning materials on various topics, written by many educators, in a digital library of courseware. Digital libraries have the potential to significantly change  the fundamental  aspects  of the classroom  in ways  that could  have an enormous  impact  on teaching  and learning.  New pedagogical  methods  should accompany digital libraries as an emerging technology for education to reach the compelling  vision  of  education.  Therefore,  for  an  ideal  e-learning  situation, digital libraries are regarded as the hub of the library collections and services that function together in the real e-learning environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.2 E-Learners' Expectations from the Librarians\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunication is not just important to break the isolation of students in an e-learning environment but also for a much more basic reason: Whatever one person says or writes, the receiver of the information will always interpret the information  in  the  receiver's  personal  context,  created  through  upbringing, culture, language, etc. This does often lead to deep misunderstandings. The only \r\nway to make sure that the information is properly understood is not by reading, listening, or looking, but by being able to check or ask if things have been understood. That is why an e-learning system ignores the importance of communication which will not workout.\r\n\r\nWhat do e-learners need from the librarians? Suggestions advocating the changes in librarians' role in support of e-learning in the information age appear throughout the literature. Librarians must assert themselves as key players in the learning process, thereby changing their roles from the information providers to educators, and they have been transferred from 'information gatekeepers\" to information gateways and advocates the librarian’s involvement in teaching communities so as to shift the focus from explaining library resources to meeting the  ongoing   information   needs   of  the  students   in  the  broad   information environment.\r\n\r\nIn responding to the need to provide ongoing digital library support, librarians  have worked at translating  what they do in a traditional  library into virtual or digital environments while customizing their services and resources for e-learners. The traditional role of academic library services has always been to provide information resources for the teaching and learning activities within the academic sphere. Its role in supporting the virtual learning environment  is not different.  The  linking  of  digital  libraries  and  virtual  library  environments  is required  to  provide  a  meaningful  connection  between  learning  activities  and learning resources. The digital libraries can help to provide information content to teaching staff who are engaged in e-learning. Traditionally, libraries offer circulation  services,  interlibrary  loans, course reserves,  an information  desk, a \r\nreference desk, and library instruction. To serve learners connected to their institutional libraries primarily through a computer network or internet, librarians are providing remote access to, and delivery of, library resources and are using communication technologies to deliver electronic reference services and instructional support.\r\n\r\nAs the literature suggests, e-learners are a wider community  of learners than  \"students\".  An academic  library's  learners  may  include  students,  faculty, staff, teachers, etc. The library is seen as a source of training and guidance to a community  of learners who are concerned with navigating  the complexities  of locating and using digital resources and services. Moreover, the move towards a digital environment has resulted in a shift from the systematic one-to-one information flow of the past to a new model in which the users and the providers of information are able to relate in a many-to-many,  dynamic relationship. For example,  in  the  traditional  model,  a  librarian  provides  a  bridge  between  the learners and the information providers by selecting and cataloguing the resources and by providing assistance with these resources. In the new model, the library serves  as  a  facilitator  by  offering  ongoing  support,  enabling  the  learners  to interact and exchange knowledge with others, to communicate directly with the publishers   and  vendors   of  information   resources,   and  to  participate   in  a collaborative endeavor to make available rich collections of online scholarly information resources. \r\n1.3.3 Parameters of Success in e-Learning Implementation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of e-learning  depends  on how learning takes place online, that is, the underlying pedagogy and the real value of e-learning lies in our ability to deploy its attributes to train the right people to gain the right knowledge and skills at the right time. The successful implementation of e-learning depends on the adherence to underlying principles that are embedded in the e-learning experiences.  Though  these  principles  apply  to  both  the  e-learning  and  the traditional classroom delivery method, they are yet to be included in the former. These pedagogical principles should form the basis for inclusion of features in e- learning  management  systems.  Bixler  and Spotts (2000) have identified  seven parameters affecting the successful implementation of e-learning: institutional support; course development; teaching and learning; course structure; student support; faculty support; and evaluation and assessment\r\n\r\nThe availability  of strong  institutional  support  is crucial  for e-learning deployment  and success.  The changing  roles of staff  must be recognized  and acknowledged. Support strategies must be developed for management of the transformation   processes.   Standards   must  be  set  and  applied   consistently. Although   the   teaching   and   learning   process   encourages   a   flexible   and independent approach to knowledge acquisition, the notion of student support is markedly different from the traditional method.\r\n\r\nLearning  is  supported  through  the  use  of  information  and communication  technology.   E-learning  can  take  place  in  one  of  the  two modes:\r\n\r\nSynchronous  e- learning  : It  is  a computer  assisted  e-learning  where \r\ninstructors  and participants can   log   on   and   interact   with   t h e  instructors and  other  participants  at  multiple locations.\r\n\r\nA   Synchronous e -learning:   C omputer ass i s t ed tr a i n i n g wh er e th e instructors and participants are involved in the course at different times.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb-based training,\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic bulletin boards, Blogs and e-mails.\r\n\r\n\r\nE-learning  includes   a  number   of  different   delivery   methodologies within   it,   including   self–paced  contents,  virtual  classrooms,  online  chats, threaded discussions etc.\r\n\r\n1.3.4 Merits of E-Learning:-\r\n\r\n\r\n•   E-learning is fast and easy to create.\r\n\r\n•   It is interactive and collaborative.\r\n\r\n•   Easy to track any given information.\r\n\r\n•\tIt has the ability to merge text and graphics by enabling the instructors to prepare quality learning materials.\r\n•\tIt has the ability to serve the large members of students at a reduced cost.\r\n•   It is consistent and cost effectiveness. \r\n•\tIt is beneficial  for working  professionals  who have no time for classroom learning.\r\n\r\nE-learning components:\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending  on  the  course  objectives  with  experience  or  expertise  of learners, e-learning may include some of these components like:\r\n\r\n•   Defined learning objectives\r\n\r\n•   High-resolution graphics.\r\n\r\n•   Video/ animation sessions.\r\n\r\n•   Authoring or programming\r\n\r\n•   Simulations\r\n\r\n•   Technology\r\n\r\n•   Training\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFigure : 1    An academic e-Learning model \r\nAssessment reinforces the learning approach of a student and is an indispensable  part  of  teaching  and  learning.  Evaluation  and  assessment  of learning  should be based on higher  order thinking  skills so that students  may adopt  a  deep  holistic  approach   to  e-learning.   Based  upon  the  underlying parameters, the authors have developed the above conceptual academic e-model as depicted in Figure: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.5 E-learning is required in Educational Institutes because:-\r\n\r\n\r\n•   To increase the academic performance of students community.\r\n\r\n•   To encourage independent learning\r\n\r\n•\tTo improve the quality of teaching by introducing various pedagogical methods.\r\n•\tTo  develop  current  learning,  learning  materials  in  interactive  e- learning.\r\n•\tTo  determine  the  information   needs  of  the  students  through  e- learning.\r\n•   To identify the appropriate existing multimedia systems.\r\n\r\n•   To identify the appropriate existing infrastructure systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE-learning improves the quality of the learning experience of the students. The driven changes are numerous and learning quality ranks poorly in relation to most of  them.   A  student   who  is  learning   in  a  way  that  uses  information and   communication   technologies   (ICTs)   is   using   an   e-learning.      These interactive  technologies  support  many  different  types  of  capabilities.  Internet \r\naccess to digital versions   of  materials   unavailable   locally,   internet   access  to search  transactional services, personalized   information and guidance for learning support, simulations   or  models   of  scientific   systems,  tools  for  creativity  and design  data analysis,   modeling   or  organization   tools   and  applications.   Over the   past   few decades,  the  new  information  and  communication  technologies have a huge impact  on the world economy  corporate  management,  globalization trends and education at all levels, including higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4 E- RESOURCES\r\n\r\nInternet and World Wide Web (WWW) have the biggest source of information  with  widest  coverage  and  the  fastest  access.    It  is  the  most powerful tool for global communication  and exchange of information.   The amount   of   publicly   available   information   on   the   web   is   increasing consistently at an unbelievable rate.  It has revolutionized the way that people access  information,  and  has  opened  up new  possibilities  in  areas  such  as digital  libraries,  information  dissemination  and  retrieval,  education, commerce, entertainment, government and health care.  The WWW can be a great place to accomplish research on many topics but finding quality web materials.\r\nE- resource is an electronic information resource that can access on the web, on or off campus.   Material  (data  and / or program  (s) encoded  for manipulation by a computerized device.  This material may require the use of a peripheral  directly  connected  to  a computerized  device  (e.g.  CD-  ROM drive) or a connection to a computer network (e.g. Internet). \r\nE-resource is defined   as a resource which requires computer access or any electronic product that delivers a collection of data, be it text referring to full  text  based,  electronic  journals,  image  collections,  other  multimedia products and numerical, graphical or time based, as a commercially available title that has been published  with  an aim to be marketed.   These  may be delivered on CD- ROM, on tape, via internet and so on.  Over the past few years, a numbers of techniques  and related standards  have been developed which allow the documents to be created and distributed in electronic form. Hence to cope up with the present situation, libraries are shifting towards new media, namely electronic resources for their collection developments that the demands of users are better fulfilled.   E- resources on magnetic and optical media have a vast impact on the collections of university libraries.  These are more useful due to the inherent capabilities for manipulation and searching, providing information access is cheaper to acquiring information resources, savings in storage and maintenance etc. and sometimes the electronic form is the only alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers are increasingly expected to use the electronic resources.   Studies were undertaken to determine the level of using of this type of resource, how users feel about various issues surrounding electronic resources and whether attitudes  change  dependent  upon  subject  studied  to determine  the level of using of various  electronic  information  resources,  ways in which they felt electronic resourced had hindered or improved their academic career, if they perceived themselves capable of using the resourced, would the standard of \r\ntheir work suffer without the use for these resource and  the various methods employed to acquire the skills necessary to use the sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with these technological advances, many stand alone CD- ROMs,  which  have  been  in  operation   for  the  last  decade,   are  being increasingly networked, providing access from any networked computer terminal in the institution not solely within the library itself, hence improving the user accessibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic  information  sources  offer  today’s  user’s  different opportunities from their predecessors.   The advantages of e-resources for the user,  the  information  needed  can  be  delivered  from  the  most  appropriate source to the user; the user can re-specify his or her needs dynamically; the information is obtained when it is wanted, so becomes ‘just in time’ rather than ‘just in case’; the user selects only the information needed to answer the specific question  and, finally, the information  is only stored for the user’s wish.   Electronic information can therefore provide a number of advantages over traditional print based sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese advantages  include the fact that electronic  information  sources are often faster than consulting print indexes, especially while searching retrospectively, and they are straighter forward while wishing to use combinations  of  keywords.     They  open  up  the  possibility  of  searching multiple files at one time; a feat accomplished more easily that while using the printed  equivalents.    Electronic  resources  can be printed  and searches \r\nsaved to be repeated at a later date; they are updated more often than printed tools.    One  main  advantage,  especially  to  distance  learners  or  those  with limited time to access the library, is their availability from outside the library by     dial–up access.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternet  and  electronic  information  with  no  print  equivalents  present new  challenges  to  the  scholars.  Increasing  information  is  being  published only in electronic formats, and questions about how to cite these sources in academic papers which have become frequent at library service desks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.1    Types of E- Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nThe e-resources are basically divided in to two major types\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   Online e-resources, which may include\r\n\r\n-    E-journal (Full Text & Bibliographic Databases)\r\n\r\n-    E- books\r\n\r\n-    On-line Databases\r\n\r\n-    Web sites\r\n\r\n2.   Other e resource may include\r\n\r\n-    CD ROM\r\n\r\n-    Diskettes\r\n\r\n-    Other portable computer databases\r\n\r\n\r\nThese components are explained in the following sections. \r\n1.4.1.1 E- Journals\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic   issues  of  journals  and  articles  to  periodicals   the  library subscribes  in.   It consists of Full-text and Bibliographic  Databases.   Full- text databases contain the whole content of an article such as citation information, text,  illustrations,  diagrams  and  tables.    Bibliographic  databases  only  contain citation information of an article, such as author’s name, journal title, publication date and page numbers. An e-database is an organized collection of information. It supports flexible and in-depth searching of different fields, e.g. journal title, article title, author, abstract, year, etc.  We can only search for journal title in the Library Catalogues, but not the title or author of individual articles.   Therefore, e-database is extremely useful to find out the articles on particular topics, e.g. Peer assessment in classroom.   A particular journal articles can retrieve from e- database, which could not find the same information via the Library Catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries have been exploring easily to cope up with the problems of ever increasing  prices  of  the  journals,  space  requirements  and  decreasing  level  of usage as the journals get older. Nevertheless, libraries are required to maintain back the issues of the journals, usually in bound form.  Electronic Journal helps the librarians in addressing these problems to a great extent without significantly affecting the service levels.  Electronic journals can be accessed via internet from any web enabled PC. Depending on the type of subscription, one or more users can access the service simultaneously,  either directly from an independent web enabled PC or in a local area network through a proxy server (IP addresses based access).   Electronic   journals   also   offer   benefit   of  full   text   searching   and \r\ndownloading  of  articles.    Many  publishers  of  electronic  journals  offer  their journals through consortia of libraries at much lower rates.   INDEST and INFLIBNET  are two such consortia  operating  in India.   Access  to articles  in electronic  journals  can  also  be made  through  aggregator  services  which  offer searchable databases of contents of e-journals from several publishers, and links to journal site for full text.  Emerald, OCLC and J-Gate are some of the example of e-journal aggregator services.  The main disadvantage of electronic journal is that libraries cannot physically posses the journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE-journals  are becoming  increasingly  in demand both as a means of rapid desktop access to current research materials and as a way to view past volumes. E-journals offer a range of potential advantages to libraries and end-users:\r\n\r\n•   Allows remote access\r\n\r\n•   Can be used simultaneously by more than one user\r\n\r\n•   Provides timely access and at the rate of 24 X 7 X 365 formula\r\n\r\n•   Supports different searching capabilities\r\n\r\n•\tAccommodates  unique  features  (e.g.  Links  to  related  items,  reference linking)\r\n•   Saves physical storage space\r\n\r\n•   Supports multimedia information\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above advantages, libraries today buy licenses for an ever- increasing number of Electronic Journals from a range of different publishers and providers, and use a diverse set of technologies for information delivery. \r\n1.4.1.2 E- book\r\n\r\n\r\nAny library is to provide quality information services for complete user satisfaction through optimum utilization of the resources the library has. In order to achieve this goal libraries acquire, preserve and disseminate the documentary as well as the non-documentary records of information. In earlier days, the library documents  were  mostly  in the  form  of  “traditional”  books  with  a designated format, i.e. a physically distinct creation made up of a collection of pages and presented  in a bound  volume.  Recent  information  handling  technologies  have significantly  influenced  the basic nature of traditional  print-based  libraries and have   created   electronic,   digital   and   virtual   libraries   containing   electronic documents like e-books, e-journals, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEspecially  in Libraries  and Information  Centers  of Indian  Universities, Institutions  of Higher  Education,  and other institutions  of national  importance like IITs, IIMs, and IIScs etc. It can be concluded that there is a need to formulate a workable and sustainable strategy in Academic Libraries. It also urgently needs that systematic efforts are taken to develop suitable information infrastructure for providing access to e-books. This impact will definitely enhance in future when demand and usage of e-books will be much more than now. \r\n1.4.1.2.1 Origin & Evolution of E-books\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first printing press with movable type that was invented in 1450 by Johannes Gutenberg revolutionized the printing process by making it simpler and more affordable. Although the first hypertext novel was published in 1987 (Afternoon,  A Story  by  Michael  Joyce),  electronic  books  did not capture  the public attention until the online publication of Stephen King’s novella Riding the Bullet in March 2000. Within 24 hours, the text had been downloaded by 400,000 computer users.\r\n\r\nThe modern concept of e-books became common after Martin Eberhart and Jim Sachs both started their own companies and developed Rocket eBook and SoftBook, the first two handheld e-book reading devices. In 1999, nowadays, there is an increasing  interest in the use of e-books and other forms of online documentation to disseminate information and provide global access to it.\r\n\r\n1.4.1.2.2 Role of E-books\r\n\r\n\r\nE-books are preferred by the users for their features like portability, upgradeability,  note making, citation, changeable font size, references, links to other relevant sites, searching, etc. The libraries purchase the e-books and view them on monitor or some specific e-book readers.\r\n\r\nE-books can also be circulated as printed books.\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Their portability gives a new chance of learning, eg., Distance learning.\r\n\r\n¾   Can be carried and transferred anywhere.\r\n\r\n¾   Their feature like changeable font size makes it easy for use.\r\n\r\n¾   Searchable and navigable through links are provided. \r\n1.4.1.2.3    Types of E-Books\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are ifferent types of e-books available in the market. Some of the types are explained in this paper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure : 2     A user viewing an electronic page on in eBook reading devices\r\n\r\n\r\nDownloadable e-Book\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contents of e-book are available on a website for downloading to the user’s PC. The users do not have to purchase any special reading device and can employ standard and well-known web techniques to obtain the book.\r\n\r\nDedicated e-Books\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  contents  of  the  books  are  downloadable  to  a  dedicated  hardware device; this has a high quality screen and a special capability for book reading. Much of the activities of dedicated e-book arena centers around the emergence of dedicated  e-book  reader’s  hardware  devices  specially  built  and  designed  to improve  the  reading  experience  and  they  incorporate  special  control  to  make book  reading  easy  and  simple.  There  is  no  need  for  PC  or  Internet  access \r\nfacilities, because the readers incorporate  modems that dial directly into the e- book publisher’s server to download books.\r\n\r\nWeb accessible e-Books\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book remains on the providers’ web site and can be accessed on a fee basis. Readers can purchase the books to receive indefinite access. Users require PC to access this kind of e-book.\r\n\r\nPrint-on-Demand Book\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of a book is stored in a system connected to a high speed, high  quality  printer  from  which  printed  and  bound  copies  are  produced  on demand. The contents may be accessible chapter by chapter basis, to enable the creation of single copies of customized books.\r\n\r\nFormats of E-books\r\n\r\n\r\nThere exist many standard formats in which e-books are available. Some of the standard formats are being discussed as under:\r\n\r\nImage files\r\n\r\n\r\nAn e-book can be distributed as a sequence of images, one for each page.\r\n\r\n\r\nRich Text Format (.rtf)\r\n\r\n\r\nRTF  files  are  actually  ASCII  files  with  special  commands  to  indicate formatting information, such as fonts and margins. \r\nHyper Text Markup  (e.g., Mozilla, Language (.html)\r\n\r\n\r\nE-books  using  HTML  can  be  read  using  a  standard  browser  Firefox,  or\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   TEX   format   is   a  popular   academic   format   for   technical   writing applications in the scientific communities of mathematics and computer science.\r\n\r\nPortable Document Format (.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nPDF  files  are  created  mainly  using  Adobe  Acrobat  that  provides  a standard form for storing and editing printed publishable documents.\r\n\r\nPostScript (.ps)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is used for describing the contents of a printed page in a higher level than the actual output bitmap.\r\n\r\nExe-book (.exe)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a compiler that produces an e-book file that, when executed, produces a simulated book onscreen, complete with page texture.\r\n\r\nDesktopAuthor (.EXE and .dnl)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is used for the creation of digital web books with virtual turning pages, including brochures, e-books, digital photo albums, etc. \r\nTechnologies Available for Reading E-Books\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two types of technologies available for using e-books:\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   online or Internet-based\r\n\r\n¾   offline or specific e-book reader based\r\n\r\nIn  the  online  version  the  user  can  read  the  text  through  an  Internet browser and this opens up possibilities of linking to other resources, cross-text searching,   and   utilization   of   dictionaries   and   so   on.   There   are   several organisations  which each offer access to tens of thousands  of e-books from a range of different publishers. Examples include:\r\n\r\n¾   Netlibrary (http://www.netlibrary.com)\r\n\r\n¾   Ebrary (http://www.ebrary.com)\r\n\r\n¾   Questia (http://www.questia.com)\r\n\r\n¾   Adobe reader in PDF format\r\n\r\n(http://www.adobe.com/products/ebookreader)\r\n\r\n¾   Hiebook reader in HI format (http://www.hiebook.com)\r\n\r\n¾   Microsoft reader in LIT format\r\n\r\n(http://www.microsoft.com/reader/downloads/default.asp)\r\n\r\n¾   Mobipocket in PRC format (http://www.mobipocket.com)\r\n\r\n¾   DX Reader\r\n\r\n¾   dotReader\r\n\r\n¾   Palm reader in PDB format\r\n\r\n(http://www.palmdigitalmedia.com/products/palmreader/free) (Sulli,\r\n\r\n2004; Gibbons, 2005). \r\nE-book Resources and Accessibility\r\n\r\n\r\nElectronic  books  are  accessible  via  the  Web  in  a  number  of  forms. Generally, they are texts that have been scanned or typed and either published on a Web server or made available on the Web for downloading.\r\n\r\nThe International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF),\r\n\r\n\r\nFormerly the Open eBook Forum (OeBF), is the trade and standards organization   dedicated   to   the   development   and   promotion   of   electronic publishing.  It provides  information  on the industry  through  statistical  reports, policy documents, educational programs\r\n\r\n¾   Project Gutenberg  (http://www.promo.net/pg)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   University of Virginia e-book Library\r\n\r\n\r\n(http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/ebooks/ebooklist.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Electronic Book eXchange (EBX)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   University of Illinois Electronic books\r\n\r\n\r\n(http://www.press.uillinois.edu/epub/books.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   University of Pennsylvania Online Books\r\n\r\n\r\n(http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   The National Academies Press ( http://www.nap.edu/)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Open Reader Consortium\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Great Books Online: Bartleby.com\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Digital Book Index\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Free Tech Books \r\n¾   Google Book Search\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Free-books4Doctors!\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   WikiBooks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial Publishers and Aggregators of E-Books\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Springer\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Wiley Inter Science Online-books\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   NetLibrary  (http://www.netlibrary.com/Gateway.aspx)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾ \t\tKluwer Online (Recently merged with Springer ) (http://www.kluweronline.com/ebooks/sales/)\r\n\r\n¾   Safari Tech Books Online: (http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   John Wiley (http://www.wiley.com) \r\n1.4.1.6 Limitation of E-Book\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the e-book has great potential and bright future to attract the users it also have some limitations.\r\n\r\n¾   Physical and Mental Strain: to read an e-book is not comfortable in comparison with printed book.\r\n¾   Reading an e-book while travelling in train or bus is not so easy and cheaper comparison with printed books. Laptop or Palm top with battery system is urgently necessary to read an e-book, which is more costly than a book.\r\n¾   In addition to cost, the user has to carry the machine which is difficult and a matter of risk like breakage / damage or theft.\r\n¾   E-book is costlier than printed book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.1.2.4 Perspective and Benefits of E-Books\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Single platform for users to access all our e-Content, with a simple, easy- to-use interface\r\n¾   Anytime, anywhere access\r\n\r\n¾   Supports your users in a variety of ways—provides access to content through Web site and downloads to portable digital devices, when possible\r\n¾   Trusted content from the world’s leading publishers—known for comprehensiveness, quality and desirability\r\n¾   Automatic check in; no shelving; no lost, stolen, damaged or overdue materials \r\n¾   Robust reporting facilitates collection development decisions\r\n\r\n¾   Integrated with leading ILS systems, including SIRSI, Dynix and\r\n\r\nInnovative Interfaces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.1.2.5 perspective and future of e-books\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Multiple formats: eAudiobooks, eBooks, eJournals, eMagazines and eDatabases\r\n¾   Multiple languages: English, Chinese, French, Spanish\r\n\r\n¾   Remote authentication accessibility; materials are available inside and outside library, 24/7\r\n¾   Collection development tools such as TitleSelect, TitleDirect, Patron- Driven Acquisition, Library Resource Center and more\r\n¾   Full-level OCLC MARC cataloging records included\r\n\r\n¾   Search functionality within and across all NetLibrary content\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.1.3 On-Line Databases\r\n\r\n\r\nOn-line Database  is a collection  of information  categorized  by specific fields.  Databases are usually searchable by keywords topics.  An e-database is an organized collection of information, of a particular subject or multi-disciplinary subject areas.   The information of an e-database can be searched and retrieved electronically.     Contents  include  journal  articles,  newspaper   articles,  book reviews and conference proceedings, etc.  Information   organized and stored in a database, with structured cross-document search and retrieval, relational data structured, efficient query mechanisms. \r\nOn-line search access to databases has generated the concept of libraries because  the  literature  reported  in  the  on-line  searches  is  scattered  in  many libraries. The libraries instead of acquiring everything on their subject field, will depend  more  on  the  network  of  which  they  will  form  a  part  and  share  the resources among themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.1.4 Websites\r\n\r\n\r\nA  library  web  page  or  Universal  Resource  Locator  (URL)  facilitates single window access to various web enabled library services.  A URL could b e as simple as a library web page listing the services with some links to catalogue and external free and subscribed resources or may include advance features like interactive  helps and value added services  such as subject  gateways,  self-help tools and frequently  asked questins, and information  about the library such as timings, calendar, rules etc can be hosted on the library web site a part from the ICT  enabled  conventional  services.    Libraries  are  making  use of potential  of internet  and  computing  power  to provide  new  and  innovative  services.    It is intended to help guide its users towards understanding  the consciousness.  The ability to view the most recent content from hundreds of websites from a single program not only keeps up-to-date on the news and information,  it is fast and easy to use.\r\n\r\nWeb pages are the presentation of information which can be presented in a  carefully  chosen  media  most  appropriately.    Web  pages  can  be  static  or dynamic,  meaning  that  the  content  is the same  each  time  someone  visits  the webpage or is taken form a database which is updated with new content.   For \r\nexample if a webpage, say the home page, had a ‘news’ area describing current news in relation to a  company or event, then when a new news item came up or expired,  new item would  appear  and old news item disappear  from the news section on the homepage.\r\n\r\nContent and its presentation is the most important part of website.   It is what people visit and hopefully recommend the website for.   Websites content can be presented in many forms, the most common and accessible being text and graphics. For example,  a website  aimed at blind or partially  sighted people is going to be a non- visual website making best use of the text (which can be heard using a text to audio web browser) spoken word and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.1.4.1 Merits of Website\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   Fast and easy access to website content.\r\n\r\n¾   No spam, few ads (about to change), only content and photographs.\r\n\r\n¾   User chooses the sites and content they want.\r\n\r\n¾   User controls what they see and don’t see.\r\n\r\n¾   User  sees  the  most  recently  updated  content  without  having  to  prowl around the site.\r\n¾   Less time searching and hunting for commonly needed information and resources.\r\n¾   Information  is presented in excerpts of full articles, free of styling and heavy-handed site designs and layouts-content and information is the priority. \r\n¾   Replaces email and newsletters to alert users of updated, new content, and other typical information like press releases and events.\r\n¾   Provides another form of content delivery in addition to the website itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.1.4.2 Objectives of Library Websites\r\n\r\n•   Promote the library usage\r\n\r\n•   Provide information about the library and its activities\r\n\r\n•   Provide online access to local information sources\r\n\r\n•\tAct as a gateway  to the networked  information  resources  (CD- ROM, Intranet / Intranet)\r\n•   Integrate Push-based services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.2.   Advantages of E- Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  reasons  for  actually  embarking  on  the  purchasing  of  electronic resources  are generally  accepted  because  of the ease  of usability,  readability, affordability and accessibility.   The following are the advantages of e-resources over the print media\r\n\r\na)  Multi-access: A networked product can provide multiple points of access at multiple pints round the clock and to multiples simultaneous users.\r\nb)  Speed:  An  electronic  resource  is  lot  quicker  to  browse  or  search,  to extract information from, and to integrate that information into other material and to cross-search or reference among the different publications. \r\nc)   Functionality:   E-   resources   will   allow   the   user   to   approach   the publications  to analyze  its content  in new ways  by clicking  of the mouse on search mode.\r\nd)  Content: The e-resources can contain a vase amount of information, but more importantly the material can consist of mixed media i.e. images, video, audio animation which could not be replaced in print.\r\ne)   Mobility\r\n\r\nf) \tSavings physical Space g) \tConvenience\r\nh)   Saving time& money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4. 3   Disadvantages of E-Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  more and more  people  prefer  e-resources  to traditional  ones, because  it can save  their  time  and  money.    However,  with  various  e- resources   flooded   in,   more   and   more   people   are   aware   of   the disadvantages of e-resources.\r\n\r\na)   The fact that, e-resources require special devices or personal computers can be looked as a disadvantage.   Many e-resources are typically produces to be compatible for certain software which in turn may be not easily available.   Since e-resources are dependent on other equipments, certain hardware or software failure may affect it.  Unless the hardware, Internet connection or battery power that is required by an e-resource reader is readily available, then its electronic document \r\nis  useless.  In  addition,   e-resources   depending   on  hardware   and software and are more easily damaged than a printed book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb)  E-resource reading devices are surely more expensive than printed books.\r\n\r\nAll devices of e-resources require power. There is a growing concern that the e-resources at present may not be accessible or compatible to the futureS e-resources software or devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc)   Screen glare and eyestrain are a serious concern for many potential users of  e-resource  technology.    A  major  worry  of  reading  from  an  e- resource  reader  could  hurt  the  eyes.     The  display  resolution  of computer screens and electronic devices is considerably less than the print quality produced by a printing press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nd)  Reading  from a computer  lacks the familiarity  and comfort  of reading from a book.  A paper book can be opened and flipped; through, while an electronic text is more difficult to navigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne)   E- Resources have unreliable life span.  Paper has a much longer life span than most digital forms of storage.  Because of the rapid development of new computer systems it is difficult to judge whether the software or hardware will become outdated.   As new hardware is developed, structures must be put into place to allow for the migration of existing materials  to  the  new  platforms  so  that  they  can  still  be  accessed. Methods   of   preserving   the   electronic   document   must   also   be \r\ndeveloped.   A high degree of reliability of the equipment must be a part of the electronic devices that handle the replacements for printed books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nf)   Many  titles  that  are  available  in  traditional  print  books  are  not  yet available in an electronic book format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ng)  New technologies always require time, experience, and money in order to take full advantage of its capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.4    Indian Scenario for E-Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries function as an essential integral component in higher education system.   Academic libraries in India are facing a lot of problems due to static budget and exponential price hike of library collections.  The library environment is currently undergoing a rapid and dynamic revolution leading to new generation of libraries with the emphasis on e-resources.  A lot of efforts have been taken in the past few years  to overcome  this problem  of financial  crunch  by resource sharing through consortia for university libraries.  UGC-INFONET and INDEST- AICTE  consortium  are  the  two  major  initiatives  for  university  library  users. These  revolutionary   steps  are  providing  scholarly  resources  including  peer reviewed  journals,  databases,  abstracts  proceeding  etc.   These efforts  must be boon to university library users which will definitely boost the level of higher education in our country. \r\nLibrary Consortium is a group of two or more libraries which have agreed to co-operate with one another in order to fulfill certain similar needs, usually resource   sharing.      It   usually,   refers   to   co-operation,   co-ordination   and collaboration between, and amongst the libraries for the purpose of sharing information.   Consortia are basically, evolving a form of cooperation among the libraries which come together to share the resources electronically.  It has gained momentum even in developing countries like India.\r\n\r\nSome of the successful library consortia setup so far in India are;\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  UGC-INFONET E-journal consortium.\r\n\r\n2)  Indian   National   Digital   Library   in   Engineering,   Sciences   and\r\n\r\nTechnology (INDEST) consortium.\r\n\r\n3)  Inter University Centers (IUC_DAEF Consortia)\r\n\r\n4)  Health Sciences Library and Information Network (HELINET)\r\n\r\n5)  Forum   for   Resource   Sharing   in   Astronomy   and   Astrophysics\r\n\r\n(FORSA)\r\n\r\n6)  Council  for  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  (CSIR  e-  journals consortium)\r\n\r\nApart  from  the  mentioned  consortia,  there  have  been  efforts  to  setup similar kind of consortia by ICAT, ICMR, ICSSR and other government agencies to provide  and access  to e-resources.    Among  the above  all consortia,  UGC- INFONET and INDEST- AICTE consortium  are proving to be a boon for the academic users.  These two major initiatives have come to the rescue of academic libraries so that they can cater to the needs of academic depending upon them. These  revolutionary   steps  are  providing  scholarly  resources  including  peer \r\nreviewed journals, databases. Abstracts, proceedings etc. these efforts will boost the higher education system in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4.5    Motivation for the Effective Utility of E-Resources\r\n\r\n\r\nToday availability  of e-resources  in an academic library is very common. But  their  proper  and  maximum  use  is a matter  for  discussion.    Advances  in computer applications during the past few decades have brought radical changes on  the  way  information  is gathered,  store,  organized,  accessed,  retrieved  and consumed. The application of computers in information processing has brought several  products  and  services  to  the  scene.    The  internet  and  the  Web  are constantly  influencing  the  development  of  new  modes  of  scholarly communication;   their  potential  for  delivering  goods  is  quite  vase  as  they overcome  successfully  the  geographical  limitations  associated  with  the  print media.  Further, the distribution time between product publication and its delivery has been drastically reduced.  The internet can be used for efficient retrieval and meeting information needs.   This is very important for university libraries since most  of them  call for more  and  more  research  work.   This  important  fact is convincing many libraries to move towards digital e-resources, which are found to be less expensive and more useful for easy access.  This is especially helpful to distant learners who have limited time to access the libraries form outside by dial- up access to commonly available electronic resources, mainly CD-ROM, OPACs and Internet, which are replacing the print media. \r\n1.5   NEED AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\nWith ever increasing information needs of the information seekers on one side  and  the  information  explosion  on  the  other  side  followed  by  the  ever shrinking library budget, price exculpation has become an inevitable problem in providing the right information to the right user at right time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the advent of computers, the nature of libraries has changed dramatically.    Today  almost  every  important  reference  tools  is  available  in electronic  format  whether  offline  or  online,  providing  convenience  of  use, storage,   timeliness   and   currency   of   information.   Computer   storage   and compression technologies have made it possible to store large amount of data and information on small digital and optical media, eliminating requirement for large space for holding the printed sources.   It is also faster and easier to keep the electronic sources up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo cater the information need of the researcher’s libraries required accessibility   to   a   variety   of   information   sources,   particularly   the   digital information in addition to the printed documents.   There is a need to study the usage  of electronic  resources  by professional  institutions  in Vellur  District  in Tamil nadu. \r\nThe  main  objective  of this  study  is to analyse  the  awareness  of Web browsers, satisfaction with the e-resources provided by the library, ranking of e- resources,  performance  of  library  and  barriers  to  access  e-resources.     The research scholars are posed to an array of electronic resources through internet for research.   They should be able to differentiate  between relevant and irrelevant information and should be able to access the needed information effectively and efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Primary objectives of the study are to identify the usage of electronic resources amongst the faculty member’s researchers, students and staff members of E Resources Users. The specific objectives of the present investigations are:\r\n\r\n¾   To examine the awareness of Library users for E-Resources ;\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   To   identify   the   availability   of   different   types   of   electronic resources in professional Institutions library;\r\n\r\n¾   To evaluate the frequency, time spent, purpose and utilization of\r\n\r\nE- Resources by the library uses;\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   To identify the frequently used databases /E-journals; and\r\n\r\n\r\n¾   To find out the problems, prospects and measures for improving the usage of e-resources in Vellur District Educational Institution Library \r\n1.7 BRIEF RESUME OF THE SUCCEEDING CHAPTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II deals with the review of related literature and gives a list of various studies to the investigation.\r\n\r\nChapter  III is concerned  with research  design  gives  a detailed  account  of the objectives,  hypothesis,  sample,  data  collection  and  methods  adopted  for  the study.\r\n\r\nChapter IV deals with the analysis and interpretation and gives the detail analysis of the data collected and statistical analysis made.\r\n\r\nChapter V  concludes the findings, recommendations and future scope. \r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

In the following sections a review of the earlier studies conducted in the area of e-resources by various authors have been collected and presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch is the process of raising a question and then trying to find an answer. It means a sort of investigation describing the fact that some problem is being investigated to shed for generalization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  paper  aims  to  provide  details  of  a  study  conducted  at  Hunter  College Libraries in   2005. The focus of the study was how the presentation of initial digital resource pages (or gateway pages) on the library's web site impacted students' subsequent steps in the research process. Results from the computer-based key tasks exercises were bifurcated. Completion rates for computer-based key task using the in-house developed Hunter College Library database grid, with less than 80 percent (37 percent-73 percent) students successfully completing all the tasks, was inferior compared to the performance using the Serial Solutions access page and the Academic Search Premier database, both commercially-developed products, with most of the tasks successfully completed by at\r\nleast 80 percent of the                students. [1] \r\nThis case study seeks to discuss the author's experience of providing e-journal services to the scientists at the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute – a centre of excellence in the field of glass and ceramics situated in Kolkata, India. It describes the developmental activities involved in providing user access to the e-journals and its impact on library operations. The author also shows that e-journals have added enormous resources to the collection and have improved the service of the library, enhanced access to  journal  literature,  and  decreased  the  demand  for  photocopy  services  as  well  as\r\ndocument delivery of single articles. [2]\r\n\r\nThe  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  report  upon  the  design,  implementation  and findings  of  a  research  study  by  investigating  the  perceptions  of  electronic  library resources within the UK to promote the education sector. While such resources are widely available to the sector, very little qualitative investigation has been done as to cast its impact upon teaching and learning and how it is viewed by those who have access to it.  The  findings  of  the  research  are  entirely  qualitative,  and  are  reported  through  a sequence of annotated quotations, which reveal personal experiences and perceptions of using electronic library resources and the influence and impact they have had on teaching\r\nand learning activities. [3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article reviewed the library performance evaluations found in the literature of the UK, Germany, USA and Taiwan and constructed primary performance evaluation indicators. The Delphi Method was then used to summarize the opinions of the experts in completing the construction of a performance evaluation model for the e-library. With all the factors of e-library, user satisfaction and input of libraries as the basis, Analytic \r\nHierarchy Process is used to illustrate the problems and combine the two to establish the hierarchy structure for the performance evaluation of this research. The weights of all the indicators within hierarchies are calculated and then the weight of the overall hierarchies is worked out.   The e-library plays two important roles: data searching and academic study. [4]\r\nThe paper seeks to provide some insight into the sharp increase in scientific\r\n\r\npublications originating from Turkish academic and research institutions in the last few years. The underlying reasons – widespread access to literature through electronic databases being the most important – are also investigated. The number of publications in electronic databases that index thousands of scientific journals can give some indication. Web of Science is one of these, and it is provided to the Turkish academic community along with several other databases by the national library consortium. Based on the Web of Science data, a comparative analysis was performed to investigate the publications\r\noriginating from Turkey and other countries. [5]\r\n\r\nThis paper addresses another important organizational impact triggered by the migration of electronic journals that has received little attention in the literature: the changes in the library's operational costs associated with shifts in staffing, resources, materials, space and equipment. A common assumption is that converting library journals to digital format will ultimately improve the library service and lower costs, but this is yet to  be  proven.  Understanding  the  total  costs  associated  with  the  library  model  for delivering digital information has now become a requirement for library survival since in the digital world, as opposed to print, the library has many viable competitors. Our goal is to develop a framework for assessing the shifts in personnel and costs that can be used for \r\nplanning and budgeting at Drexel and provide guidance to other academic libraries which are not yet so far down this path.[6]\r\nThis paper focuses on data collection techniques representing the use of library networked electronic resources.  It briefly notes some of the e-metrics initiatives of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL), and lists out the relevant standards for vendor supplied data.   This paper argues that as libraries become increasingly less dependent upon vendor-supplied, subscription e-journals and full-text databases for access to scholarly information, so web-based surveys coupled with a networked infrastructure of assessment, such as suggested by the MINES for Libraries project, will become more important tools for evaluating the networked electronic resources.   Web-based usage surveys  are  increasingly  relevant  to  the  collection of usage  data  to  make  collection development and service decisions, to document evidence of usage by certain patron\r\npopulations, and to collect and analyze performance outputs. [7]\r\nTo determine whether Canada's university research capacity could be increased in quantity, breadth and depth of published scholarly information available to academic researchers, especially through the use of e-journals and cooperatively negotiated pricing and licensing of them. It also demonstrates that CNSLP has successfully found a new model for negotiating and licensing electronic information to expand the information available to the researchers. It is also identified that over 80 percent of the respondents believe  that  e-journal  access  had  a  significant  impact  on  their  ability  to  conduct research.[8]\r\n\r\nThis paper examines the pressures being exerted on university library budget structures  by  consortial  license  agreements  and  “Big  Deal”  arrangements.  Particular \r\nreference is made to the developments at three higher educational institutions located in the city of Glasgow, Scotland: the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow Caledonian University, and the University of Glasgow. Pricing in the electronic information environment is likely to remain a complex and a difficult area for the foreseeable future and academic library budgets will need to be sufficiently flexible in nature to be able to accommodate the complexities of current economic models. This flexibility is likely to\r\nrequire some degree of funding to remain under central control. [9]\r\nElectronic journal packages, or bundles, have become standard resources in academic libraries in just the last few years. The impact on collections and budgets will be significant, but are largely yet unmeasured. A survey was designed to provide some data concerning the financial and collection implications of these bundles, and was distributed to the fourteen academic libraries within the Boston Library Consortium. Results are presented and discussed. [10]\r\n\r\nThis  study  assesses  the  ways  in  which  citation  searching  of  scholarly  print journals is to back link searching of scholarly e-journal articles on the WWW, and identifies problems and issues related to conducting and interpreting such searches. Back link searches are defined here as searches for Web pages that link to a given URL. Back link searches were conducted on a sample of 39 scholarly electronic journals. Search results were processed to determine the number of back linking pages, total back links, and external back links made to the e-journals and to their articles. The results were compared to the findings of a citation study performed on the same e-journals in 1996. A content analysis of a sample of the files back linked to e-journal articles was also undertaken. The authors identified a number of reliability issues associated with the use \r\nof  raw  search engine data to evaluate the impact of electronic journals and articles. No correlation was found between back link measures and ISI citation measures of e-journal impact, suggesting that the two measures may be assessing something quite different. Major differences were found between the types of entities that cite, and those that back link, e-journal articles, with scholarly works comprising a very small percentage of back\r\nlinking files. [11]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few experimental projects, peer-reviewed electronic journals (e-journals) have been in existence for only about ten years. The purpose of this research was to study the effects of e-journals, at this early point in their lives, on the scholarly communities they are serving. The study addresses the question: To what extent are scholars and researchers aware of, influenced by, using, or building their own work on research published in e-journals? To put the question another way: What impact are e- journals having on the process of scholarship, research, and the advancement of knowledge? A sample of scholarly, peer-reviewed e-journals was drawn and techniques of citation analysis were used to conduct several analyses. The data shows, with a few possible exceptions, that the impact thus far of e-journals on scholarly communication\r\nhas been minimal. [12]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper discusses the first findings of the empirical research project focusing on users' experiences of the virtual reference desk. The most central issues of the article deal with the user perceptions of reference transactions by using e-mail or chatting services and comparing those with perceptions about in-person transactions. The initial findings suggest that virtual reference service is not necessarily more successful than the traditional services received at the physical reference desk. This indicates the limitations \r\nof computer-mediated communication; the results also imply many challenges for the development of virtual reference services so that they would be able to complement more effectively the traditional in-person transactions. [13]\r\nThe journal is fundamental to formal scholarly communication. This research report highlights the preliminary findings from an empirical study of scholarly electronic journals. The purpose of the research is to assess the impact of electronic journals (e- journals) on scholarly communication, by measuring the extent to which they are being cited in the literature, both print and electronic. The intent is to provide a snapshot of the impact of         e-journals on scholarly communication at a given point in time, roughly at the end of 1995. This study provides one measure of that impact, specifically on the formal, as opposed to informal, communication process. The study also examines the forms in which scholars cite e-journals, the accuracy and completeness of citations to e- journals, and practical difficulties faced by the scholars and the researchers who wish to retrieve e-journals through the networks. [14]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the present survey is to study the use of the internet by the researchers at Punjab University, Chandigarh in all the three fields of knowledge—Science, Social Science and Humanities, so as to determine its impact on their academic routine. For this purpose, 200 questionnaires were distributed, 80 questions to the researchers in Science,\r\n80 questions to the researchers in Social Science, and 40 questions to the researchers in Humanities. This was in proportion to the total number of researchers working in these fields. The results of the survey indicate that Internet has had a great impact on the academic environment. The researchers in the Sciences are making the maximum use of \r\nthe Internet facility provided by the University; however, the researchers in other fields still rely on bibliographies and printed journals. Researchers in Social Sciences and Humanities  consider  their  institutional  libraries  as  the  last  resort  for  obtaining information. Although academic resources are offered through online in their fields also, it may be that researchers have not been taught, or have not yet figured out, how to locate these resources. For this purpose, firstly the academic staff should encourage the use of electronic information sources for the research study. Secondly, the librarians should be\r\nprovided with proper training in the use of online information               sources. [15]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries have witnessed a great metamorphosis in recent years both in their collection development and in their service structure. Over the last several years, a significant transformation has been noticed in collection the development policies and practices. The  print  medium  is  increasingly  giving  way  to  the  electronic  form  of materials. This study examines the libraries by region within the State of Karnataka, India. It examines the level of effort taken by the Engineering college libraries in Karnataka to build electronic resources. The collection and service infrastructure of the libraries in the sample regions are not up to the mark. Engineering college libraries are struggling to build digital collection and disseminate digital information, due to the following factors: lack of ICT infrastructure, lack of IT trained manpower, lack of awareness of the digital resources, lack of user demand, lack of financial support, lack of access like computer facilities, lack of knowledge about the digital preservation methods,\r\nlack of training for the digital access, etc. [16] \r\nThe Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) launched the Scholars Portal in 2001.  The Portal provides access to the networked electronic resources purchased consortially  by  twenty  Ontario  Universities.   The  assessment  team  at  OCUL  has partnered  with  the  Association  of  Research  Libraries  Statistics  and  Measurement Program to use the innovative survey methodology: Measuring the Impact of Networked Electronic Services for Libraries (MINES for Libraries™) to assess the impact of the Scholars Portal on the academic community in sixteen Ontario libraries. MINES for Libraries™ are an online transaction-based survey that collects data for the purpose of use and demographics of electronic resource users. This paper describes the evolution of MINES for Libraries™ as a new survey method has been adapted from the earlier well- established approaches, discovers how the evaluation process unfolded with the OCUL\r\nimplementation, and analyses the OCUL/MINES survey results. [17]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ascertain whether the open access articles have a greater research impact than the articles not freely available, as measured by the citations in the ISI Web of Science database. The four disciplines represented a range of open access uptake: 17% of articles in Philosophy are open access, 29% in Political Science, 37% in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and 69% in Mathematics. There is a significant difference in the mean citation rates for open access articles and non-open access articles in all four disciplines. The  percentage  difference  in  mean  is  45%  in  Philosophy,  51%  in  Electrical  and Electronic Engineering, 86% in Political Science, and 91% in Mathematics. Mathematics has the highest rate of open access availability of articles, but Political Science has the least difference in mean citation rates, suggesting there are other, discipline-specific\r\nfactors apart from the rate of open access uptake affecting research impact. [18] \r\n\r\n\r\nAs  a  part  of  the  2006  Colorado  Academic Library  Impact  Study,  undergraduate students and the faculty from nine colleges and universities were asked to provide information about the services they used at their institution’s library. They were also asked about their success in accessing the resources through their own library and other libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•   Computer access is utilized by the students far more than by the faculty.\r\n\r\n•\tThe use of interlibrary loan services is much more widespread among the faculty members than the students.\r\n•\tOnly slightly more than half of the surveyed faculties (52%) feel that they can usually find the print periodicals they need through their institution’s library. [19]\r\n\r\nA  library's  digital  collection  development  objective  is  not  far  from  its  original mandate, i.e., to select, acquire, manage, preserve, and finally archive learning resource materials, which will support the academic, curricular and research needs of its parent institution. However, as far as the usage of digital resources over their print counterparts is concerned we have experience a paradigm shift. In most of our academic institutions and research centre, the user communities have access to digital information by using personal computers in their offices, libraries, computer centre. Unless the state-of-art strategies are adopted from time to time, the libraries will face the problems in many ways. This chapter explores the possibilities and strategies towards creating and operating a digital repository, a Central Digital Archive of the IIM Consortium Resources, in Internet compatible format, and making the contents accessible to all the IIM’s via the \r\nWorld Wide Web, on 24 x 7 x 365 basis. The archive is envisaged as a robust backup of the vast digital wealth of the IIM Consortium and a central repository playing the role of an intellectual network nerve centre. [20]\r\n\r\nThe economic development of a country depends heavily on its scientific strength and the ability to resolve the problems in such areas as public Health, Infectious Disease, Environmental Management, or Industrial Progress. Access to the research information traditionally depends on the ability to pay, which has a negative impact on developing countries. A number of new initiatives address this imbalance, ranging from consortial licensing and new publishing models to the Open Access Initiative, and have the ability to meet the needs of research in financially constrained countries. The advent of the Open Access strategies, particularly international institutional archives, has the potential to\r\nrevolutionize the access to essential research. [21]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper examines the methodology and results from the Web-based surveys of more than 15,000 networked electronic services users in the United States between July\r\n1998 and June 2003 at four academic health science libraries and two large main campus libraries serving a variety of disciplines. A statistically valid methodology for administering simultaneous Web-based and print-based surveys using the random moments sampling technique is discussed and implemented. Results from the Web-based surveys showed that there were approximately four remote networked electronic services users for each in-house user at four academic health science libraries. This ratio is even higher for faculty, staff, and research fellows at the academic health sciences libraries, where more than five remote users for each in-house user were recorded. At the two main \r\nlibraries, there are approximately 1.3 remote users for each in-house user of electronic information. Sponsored research (grant funded research) has accounted for approximately\r\n32% of the networked electronic services activity at the health science libraries and 16% at  the  main  campus  libraries.  Sponsored  researchers  at  the  health  science  libraries appeared to use networked electronic services most intensively from on-campus. The purpose of using the networked electronic resources by the patrons within the library is different from the purpose of using those resources by patrons from the remote place. The implications of these results on how the librarians reach decisions about the networked\r\nelectronic resources and services are discussed. [22]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo examine the use of electronic information services (EIS) among the users of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Library in Delhi, India, both questionnaires and observational methods were used for data collection where 300 valid samples were collected. The analysis of data collected covers the awareness of EIS services, use of e- journals, advanced search facilities, acquaintance with electronic information sources, the purpose of using e-information, problems faced by the users while using EIS, infrastructure facilities available and the satisfaction level of the users.  It is found from the study that Boolean logic and truncation are the most often used search facilities by IIT users. Lack of printing facilities, terminals and trained staff are the major reasons that would discourage the users from accessing the EIS. The survey also reveals that some 60\r\nper cent of the users face difficulties while browsing e-information. [23]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  present  paper  explains  the  research  conducted  into  various  aspects  of  the author’s  experience,  attitudes  and  perceptions  of  publishing  in  paper  and  electronic \r\njournals. A sample of 1,040 authors in a variety of disciplines was identified as having published a journal article in the preceding year. A questionnaire was distributed to those authors and 537 usable replies were received. The questionnaire was analysed in terms of author experience in the paper and electronic domains, authors’ views on various aspects of electronic journals and their current skills. The results of the questionnaire suggest a small but increasing willingness to submit articles to electronic journals, and also suggest the continuing concern about the permanence of such media. Almost a third of the sample felt that the addition of multimedia to their articles would be beneficial but few had the necessary skills to produce and incorporate multimedia objects. It is concluded that the authors  should  be  involved  more  in  future  research  and  debate  in  electronic  serial\r\npublishing. [24]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe escalating price of the rapidly growing number of electronic journals, databases, indexes, and books, along with the traditionally published print subscriptions and monographs, will soon force the library administrators and collection development officers to make decisions between electronic or print products in the new millennium. The increasing costs of the dual format subscriptions or indexes are unfeasible and perhaps even unnecessary from the users’ point of view in the disciplines of Political Science and Economics. The researcher compared the annual subscription prices and the percentage increases of the 203 core printed journals with their electronic counterparts in the disciplines of Political Science and Economics during the academic year 1998-2000. The complete list of electronically available titles were identified and priced, and then the titles costing greater than $500 were separated. The electronic usage of statistics was examined for the expensive serials, based upon the number of hits cumulated by the \r\nusers’ requests via the Web sites of the Texas A&M University Libraries. After the pricing information and the usage of statistics for both electronic and printed resources were produced, the researcher had a clear answer for the electronic and paper dilemma. [25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutlines of the issues concerning electronic journals are found in higher education libraries.  Reports  on  a  research  project  at  Liverpool  John  Moores  University  to investigate the reasons for any resistance to the purchase of electronic journals, given that the library/information profession has embraced a new technology. Comments on the findings from the first stage of the research (the UK situation), and details of the methodology for the second, third and the final stage (the North America situation) is in process now. The findings from the first stage including cost issues, the electronic environment, document delivery and archiving and identifying areas for further research\r\nhas been discussed. [26]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReflecting upon the short history and fast development of electronic journals, there is no doubt that electronic journals open up many exciting service opportunities for academic libraries. This technology possesses both advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages include multimedia capabilities, speed of production and distribution, and accessibility. Disadvantages are technological, socio-cultural, and economic barriers. As a literature review, this article begins with a brief historical background of electronic journals.  It  then  delineates  the  positive  and  negative  aspects  of  the  technology  and reviews the crucial issues and trends concerning electronic journals, which librarians need to be aware of and understand. Some practical implications that are unique to \r\nacademic libraries are also discussed. Although it is a relatively new territory, it is certain that librarians’ analytical abilities and cooperative efforts to examine and balance the factors can make electronic journals a success in academic libraries. [27]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of electronic journals and electronic versions of journals have made serial collection management more complex. Libraries want to offer a particular journal both in print and electronic formats, which is often not financially feasible. More publishers are charging separately for the print or electronic versions or charging a higher price for both bundled together. As the budgets become tight, librarians have to choose between one format and another. In order to make the decision about what format to purchase, librarians need to know the format preferences of the users. To determine these preferences, library professionals can use several methods, such as user surveys, usage\r\nreports, and educated guessing. [28]\r\n\r\n\r\nSukovic  discusses  that  the  appearance  of  electronic  text  centres  within  the libraries during the past several years has been a significant development for both the library and research communities. At the same time, electronic texts have become a great challenge to the traditional roles in the library, research and publishing communities. Development of electronic textual resources mean dealing with the documents in new ways and in different levels, often involving work on a document's content through text encoding. This development challenges the library's assumed position in the research process. Discussing were done about why libraries should be involved in text encoding, particularly since text encoding affects information access and preservation, which are traditional library tasks. [29] \r\n\r\n\r\nCliff describes the application of Open Archives Initiative (OAI) techniques, via the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol at the Resource Discovery Network (RDN) for the development of Resource Finder, a search engine intended to provide a seamless search across all the gateway databases and present the mixed results from any subject area. Because Resource Finder merges all the results from all the databases. The distributed model significantly slows the response times. This is because any search is limited to the slowest database or network connection. In addition, Resource Finder has to wait for all the results from a given database (not, say, the first ten) and locally rank the complete set and there is a processing overhead. The RDN is a collaborative network of subject gateways, funded for the usage by UK Higher and Further Education by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). Each subject gateway, as a part of its service, provides the end user with access to the databases of descriptions of freely available, high\r\nquality, World Wide Web resources. [30]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBerthon  aimed  to  build  a  distributed  and  permanent  collection  of  digital resources  from  the  field  of  digital  preservation.  All  resources  incorporated  in  this\r\n'safekeeping' project have been selected from the PADI (Preserving Access to Digital Information)  subject  gateway  database  (http://www.nla.gov.au/padi),  whose  initiative aims to provide mechanisms that will help to ensure that information in digital form is managed with appropriate consideration for preservation and future access. Its Web site is a subject gateway to the resources about digital preservation. Describing the first phase of this safekeeping project, being undertaken by the National Library of Australia, with \r\nfunding from CLIR (Council on Library and Information Resources). This project aims to identify the significant resources in digital preservation early in their lifecycle and also aims to facilitate the cooperative development of a distributed network of 'safe kept' material with resource owners, or parties nominated by them, providing long-term access to their material. It is anticipated that a diversity of technical and organizational solutions will be employed within this project that relies on cooperation within the digital preservation community, rather than on formal agreements, to realize an asset of communal  value.  It  discusses  some  early  findings  and  outcomes  of  the  safekeeping project but recognizes that a full assessment of this approach must await evaluation over\r\nan extended period. [31]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHart etc. describes the introduction of a Competency Based Progression (CBP) scheme by Staffordshire Library and Learning Resources Service (LLRS) to facilitate the staffing  reorganization  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the  services  remain  viable  in  the dynamic world of both higher education and library and information services. It sets out the individual stages in the implementation of the CBP scheme, covering: the Steering Group; identification of competencies; framework structure; phases (development, target,\r\nachieving, outstanding); profiles; assessment; reward  model; and evaluation. [32]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGray and Abaid introduced a philosophical framework for cultural diversity in academic and public library collections followed by a practical approach to the collection development for library media collections. They investigated the issues related to identifying, evaluating and acquiring audiovisual resources that accurately portray the \r\npeople from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Practical information such as sources for selection, sources of reviews, promotion of multicultural collections, current awareness strategies for identifying the new resources, and listings of relevant catalogues and Web sites were discussed. [33]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKenney etc. explained that the actuaries are concerned with calculating what benefits a company should offer, at what price, and for how long. Their job is to make sense of all the empirical and statistical evidence of age, gender, health, heredity, life styles, physical habits, and living and working conditions that serve as the indicators of longevity,  productivity,  and  obligation.  Archivists  and  the  research  librarians  are interested in preserving the World Wide Web resources to face a similar challenge. Librarians increasingly depend on digital assets which they neither own nor manage. This research describes the current Web preservation efforts by the libraries and the archives and suggests how a new preservation strategy could use a risk management methodology. The approach taken by Cornell University's Project Prism (Main Project Prism (http://www.prism.cornell.edu/) and Library Project Prism (http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/prism.html)  is  to  explore  the  technologies and tools designed to assess the lifestyle and habits of the Web that  the research libraries and other entities can monitor and is useful to develop the retention policies for online resources. The approach begins with characterizing the nature of preservation risks in the Web environment, develops a risk management methodology for establishing a preservation monitoring and evaluation program and leads to the creation of management tools and policies for virtual remote control. The approach demonstrates how the Web \r\ncrawlers and other automated tools and utilities can be used to identify the risks; to implement appropriate and effective measures to prevent, mitigate, recover from damage and loss of Web-based assets; and to support post-event remediation. [34]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorlin expresses that traditional reference services, where librarians gives the users the right or wrong answers to the questions, has slowly begun to change. With the emergence of electronic resources, digitalization, World Wide Web resources, and full text databases, many students need more of a consultation on where to get started than on which option is correct. Librarians at Arizona University Libraries strive to help the students to gain user sufficiency and information literacy. When on the reference desk, they tend to teach rather than do the work for the students. As the libraries are customer centered,  it  was  decided  to  conduct  an  evaluation  for  its  reference  services.  The evaluation involved using a combination of surveys, focus groups, and unobtrusive observation  worksheets  with  a  small  sample  of  students.  The  results  were  very\r\nmeaningful. [35]\r\n\r\nWilkinson describes that the electronic reference resources are becoming an increasingly greater part of reference publishing and reference collections. At present an interview-style joint discussion among several US academic librarians and publishers, who provide valuable insights into the current and future position of print and electronic reference materials and reference publishing. Topics covered include: the proportion of a reference collection in electronic format and the proportion of reference titles published in electronic format; the extent to which publishers are abandoning print versions of reference resources and the librarians' reactions to this trend; the impact on librarians and \r\npublishers about the marketing of electronic resources that have as their core existing print  resources  along  with  the  expanded  or  updated  materials  and  links;  and  the importance of the usage of statistics for electronic resources. [36]\r\n\r\n\r\nBlock traces the long history of the usage of remote, off-site storage for library materials. Despite the changes in the kinds of information and materials that are stored and the technologies that enable their storage, the relationship between a reader's time and  the  distance  of  material  from the  reader  is  a  constant  challenge  to  information providers. It is concluded that the competing visions of service and economics, to which remote storage is one response, are timeless. [37]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlock compares the coverage of electronic databases not usually searched by educating the students and the faculties which may be more useful for comprehensive retrieval in the discipline of higher education. These databases were analysed and compared in terms of their usefulness for educational research using 3 topics of current interest in the field: affirmative action; tenure; and school to work. The Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) served as a benchmark database against which the results  from  other  databases  were  compared  and  was  itself  examined  to  see  how\r\neffectively it covered the 3 topics. [38]\r\n\r\nPhelps suggests that building 'permissive, but robust' digital libraries and services is an attractive alternative to the library and computer science tradition of building 'strict, but fragile' systems. Strict, but fragile, systems are efforts to the engineer to complete the systems that ensure the desired properties, but which often prove impractical in the \r\ndistributed environments without a central authority to co-ordinate change. The permissive, but robust, approach, permits the individual components to change in ways that might cause a desired property to fail to persist. It describes the application of the permissive, but robust, approach to two related problems of reference in the distributed information systems. The first application yields robust hyperlinks and the second, robust locations. Robust hyperlinks address the familiar issue of providing persistent reference to the networked resources, such as Web pages, given changing, unco-operating services. Robust locations concern references to the changing subdocument resources. (Original\r\nabstract - amended). [39]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClyde discusses that the article included in a special issue devoted to the theme: Library automation: moving into the next generation. It starts from the assumption that all school libraries should be computerized and considers the contribution that computers could make to the school library: as an administrative tool; as a resource for teaching information skills; and as a part of the library collection in the form of software and databases on disc. It is concluded that if school libraries are automated for the right reasons, to provide better access to the information resources and to provide a tool for the teaching  of  information  searching  skills  through  the  online  public  access  catalogue\r\n(OPAC), then a case can be made for every school library to be automated. [40]\r\n\r\nRoyan, B. Scran describes the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network (SCRAN) (http://www.scran.ac.uk), a 15 million pound project to build a networked multimedia full text database for the study and celebration of human history and material culture,  drawn  largely  from  the  libraries,  museums,  archives  and  built  heritage  of \r\nScotland. SCRAN currently provides access to 80,000 images, sound and film clips and virtual reality objects, and this total is expected to rise to 120,000 by August 2001. It pays particular attention to the methods of information searching and retrieval.  [41]\r\nWeimer  etc.  express  mostly  about  the  computer  programming  manuals  or\r\n\r\nmaterials about the Internet. The increasing publication and acquisition of books accompanying          CD-ROMs, it was felt necessary to review the libraries' policy of separating CD-ROMs from their books and securing them behind a service desk. It was believed that CD-ROMs shelved in the open stacks with their books would circulate more than when the CD-ROMs were housed separately. Further it was believed that the books and their accompanying CD-ROMS, if lost or stolen, would be easily replaced. Data were gathered about the circulation rates of these materials when they were separated, the loss of rates in the open stacks when they were shelved together and the availability of replacements. Based upon the data gathered as well as other considerations, it was recommended that for items accompanying CD-ROMs, the CD-ROM should be kept\r\nwith in the book, with no additional security beyond the book's sensitized stripe. [42]\r\n\r\nEvans and Brickley describe the origin and the development of the Bristol Biomedical  Image  Archive  (http://www.brisbio.ac.uk)  the  World  Wide  Web  based service at the Institute for Learning and Research Technology (ILRT), Bristol University, UK, consisting of a growing collection of 8500 images in the medical, dental and veterinary fields, donated by the academics worldwide and freely available following registration. It describes the online cataloguing of the digitized images using metadata, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language Scheme and the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. Other aspects covered \r\ninclude:  image  checking;  technical  development;  security  and  electronic  teaching resources. [43]\r\nBrancolini discusses the collection development in an electronic environment. One of the most important challenges faced by the digital library planners is the selection of  research  collections  for  digitisation.  The  costs  associated  with  creating  digital resources are significant. Planners must develop the selection criteria and procedures in order to ensure that limited time and resources are committed to the projects to digitise the most significant collections with the highest probability of successful completion. Librarians  at  many  academic  libraries  have  developed  the  selection  criteria  for  the creation of digital collections. These criteria consider many of the same factors that go into the decision to license or purchase information resources. However, there are additional considerations. Librarians at Harvard University have written the most comprehensive guide to the selecting research collections for digitisation. In this article, the author applies the Harvard Model to a digitisation project at Indiana University in order to evaluate the appropriateness of the model for the usage at another institution and\r\nto adapt the model to local needs. [44]\r\n\r\nSharma   describes   that   Information   technology   (IT)   involves   computers, electronic media, and satellite, telecommunications and storage devices. It has made a deep impact on the academic libraries. The emphasis of these libraries is shifting from collection to access. Academic libraries in India still face several challenges due to the emergency of IT. It lists all the challenges and deals in detail about one of the foremost challenges, i.e. manpower development in the context of IT. It discusses the provision of raising the facilities on IT in the library schools, inclusion in curriculum, short term \r\ntraining facilities by other organisations, refresher courses, participation in workshops, seminars, conferences, conventions etc. For their own survival and for the survival of the profession, the librarians have to play their role effectively in future; otherwise they will be replaced by a new group of professionals. [45]\r\nMacArthur  discusses  many  librarians,  especially  those  in  technical  services;\r\nseem reluctant to accept Web-based opacs, or webpacs. However, libraries are facing the real competition from the Internet information supplied by other organizations and it is important that they begin offering Web-based opacs as soon as possible in order to keep their credibility as information providers. It suggests the categories of materials that should be prioritized for inclusion in Web-based opacs and provides a list of helpful Web resources for cataloguing the electronic resources. [46]\r\n\r\nDavis and Stone tell    explain the decision to install Web Cat to integrate the electronic journals into the print collection, provide hypertext links to journal home pages from within the catalogue record and offer catalogue access across 5 sites. It describes the Web Cat functionality, linking to the Internet based resources and the feasibility of using Z39.50 for integrating catalogue access. [47]\r\nHinchcliffe explains the following: combining traditional and distance education\r\ndelivery methods; evaluating Web-based courseware; affect and impression management; and faculty training. Reports of the following topics and programmes: teaching information literacy skills in online courses; converting training methods to a dynamic learning environment; learning in the digital age; distance education quality standards; the library's role in distance learning support services; and electronic library resources and                   instructions [48] \r\nCuendet covers the national consortium for electronic information in research and education  Bib link (workshop on the Swiss Internet clearinghouse for information specialists, which provides links facilitating research); reference services and the new media (workshop on electronic reference services in relation to skills and training requirements for librarians); analog and digital supports (presentation on the range of supports now available, with emphasis on the Internet); and digitisation of sound archives at Radio Swiss Romande (identifying priority material for conversion, both current and\r\nretrospective). [49]\r\n\r\nCalhoun reviews which are published in Choice are known to influence book selection, particularly for academic library collections. It reports the results of an investigation to determine how many books, which were reviewed over a 7 year period in Choice Reviews (the CD-ROM database version of Choice), were subsequently received or purchased by the Cain Library, California State University at Dominguez Hills, as well as by a large number of other libraries across the USA. Check list of the online public access catalogues (OPACs) in the libraries revealed that all of the books mentioned in Choice Reviews were purchased by (1) or more libraries, while the majority of the books were  purchased  by  several  hundred  libraries.  The  findings  were  further  tested  to determine the extent to which they could be incorporated into an academic approval programme. (2) Notification slip approval plans were created for new titles from the presses and publishers of the best received books. Notification slip titles were searched shortly after they appeared or were profiled by the vendors and a correlation was found\r\nbetween the later review holdings and these early approval holdings. [50] \r\nYu  discusses  the  electronic  resources  and  their  use  in  libraries,  from  the viewpoint of reference services, with an emphasis on the Internet and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). It discusses the concept and functions of GIS and compares the use of GIS in libraries with library map  collections. It  reviews GIS projects in libraries and examines GIS user services and the challenge they pose. It discusses the user access to GIS and argues that simplified and varied user interfaces are important to\r\nimprove user access. [51]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSklar   defines a licence and outlines the difference between licensing and copyright. It looks at the issues for consideration while entering into a licensing or other agreement with a vendor of electronic resources. These are: defining use and users; monitoring use and maintaining security and privacy; and the question of warranties. It outlines the procedures to be followed while purchasing the electronic resources. [52]\r\n\r\n\r\nWilson expresses that the Documents Center Web site, created at the Michigan University Graduate Library's Documents Center is designed to fill 2 major missions: to serve  as  a  reference  tool  for  answering  in  person,  telephone,  and  e-mail  questions, relating to US government and international organization publications, asked about the Documents Center staff; and as a bibliographic instruction platform for teaching library research skills to graduate and undergraduate students. The Web site has dramatically changed the information delivery at the Documents Center, suggesting the need for new statistical  measurement  standards,  a  reallocation  of  staff  time,  and  active  library marketing strategies. [53] \r\n\r\n\r\nWalters discusses that the internet resources have grown in number and importance, public and private organizations have begun to develop World Wide Web based   aggregations   of   periodicals,   conference   reports   and   data   files.   The   best aggregations of Web resources combine the authoritative information, effective retrieval mechanisms and dependability of access. The worst can be incomplete, inaccurate and difficult to use. Libraries can expand their Web holdings and maintain high quality information services by selecting aggregations based on objective standards of content, coherence and functionality. It describes the work of the Albert R. Mann Library, Cornell University and concludes that these 3 criteria’s can also be used to plan the most effective\r\npresentation of aggregated resources in the library catalogue or Web site. [54]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademic Libraries have the outlines of the background to the preparation by the Media Resources Committee of the Association of College and Research Libraries in the USA of draft guidelines for media resources. The guidelines are set out under the following headings: objectives; organization/administration; staff; budget; user services; collections; facilities; and bibliographic access and cataloguing. [55]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLee analyses the results of a survey undertaken with the joint support of the Readex Corporation and the Government Documents Round Table of the American Library Association. The survey was administered to foreign documents libraries at 132 research libraries in the USA and Canada to determine the current collecting practices and policies among those libraries with strong foreign documents collections. Trends \r\nidentified include: continuing  reliance on print format with a slowly increasing use of electronic resources; and integration of foreign documents into the general collection management policies of research library collections. [56]\r\n\r\n\r\nNorman analyses the results of a study, involving a questionnaire survey and visits to 15 academic libraries in Canada and the US, of collection development practices. Includes:  the  impact  on  the  materials  budget,  collection  development  policies  and licenses; identification, evaluation, selection and development of the collection; training subject specialists in the use of electronic information resources; and the changing role of collection development librarians. [57]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBakker explains that online communication systems have extended the scope of today's research libraries beyond the boundaries of their own collections. For efficient collection management it is essential to know how far the collections meet the users' needs. In the Netherlands consideration must be given to the creation of a national repository for electronic resources. Libraries will increasingly be forced to reduce the expenditure on printed materials to free funds for electronic resources. The creation of a comprehensive network of research collections offers scope for a range of cooperative\r\nprojects. [58]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDupuis discusses that technological changes that are occurring rapidly and the students entering colleges are bringing very disparate computer skills and attitudes. Some students are reluctant to embrace new technologies; others demand electronic resources \r\nfor all assignments. By considering the computer access and Internet resources available to the elementary school students today, it is possible to imagine what a user will expect from the libraries tomorrow. Although college students may arrive at libraries with increased computer skills, their knowledge of electronic information may be lacking. It defines the information literacy with an overview of information literacy skills. The Digital Information Literacy programme at Texas University at Austin serves as a case study for integrating information literacy skills into traditional services and partnerships.\r\n[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRees considers the legal aspects of electronic information access in the context of Plymouth College of Further Education, Library and Learning Resources Service, UK. It covers the licensing of purchases and how they are used and for what purposes, health and safety, access to information (particularly Internet use), copyright and plagiarism and the use of electronic mail. [60]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavidsen describes the design and construction of the Web site: Michigan Electronic Library (MEL); the world's largest evaluated and organized World Wide Web based library of Internet resources with over 18000 links in 14 different subject areas. Produced by Michigan University, MEL has 3 goals: to provide a library with electronic information resources, selected by the librarians, with a focus on local, state and federal government  information;  to  provide  free  access  via  existing  telecommunications networks to as many Michigan libraries and residents as possible; and to provide a backbone of electronic information resources which will allow Michigan's libraries to \r\nfocus on developing and contributing local electronic community information resources. (The Michigan Electronic Library Home page is at URL (http://mel.lib.mi.us). [61]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSung describes the work of the National Central Library, Taiwan, in developing its Remote Electronic Access / Delivery service of the National Central Library (READncl). READncl results from several years' work in the electronic storage of the library's substantial collection of academic periodicals, government publications and literary and historical materials. READncl features 9 systems with over 1 million entries,\r\n3 million pages of text images on CD-ROMs, 246 full text hyperlinked periodicals and links to the Web sites and electronic mail addresses of 160 publishers, 142 government agencies and 50 libraries. For the future stage, it is planned to encourage the collaborative efforts between the librarianship and the publishing professions to establish the digital databases by providing the digitized learning                     resources. [62]\r\n\r\n\r\nToszegi expresses that the Hungarian national union catalogue of foreign journals was separated from the union catalogue of books in 1970. Computerized processing was started in 1982. Due to the lack of financial resources and other limitations imposed upon the libraries, the number of reporting institutions have dwindled to half the previous number; however, the number of records have been increased. The database has been available for online searching since 1988, and the CD-ROM version of the database is also very popular; it is also available in the Internet. Issues to be addressed in the future include retrospective processing of periodicals and registration of electronic periodicals. Original abstract – amended. [63] \r\n\r\n\r\nSievers describes the experience of planning, building and organizing the library services in the new Kelvin Smith Library on the campus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. The library was planned and designed to be a 'virtual library' and relies heavily on supply of information through the electronic resources as well as through the traditional means. Outlines the library's serial-based 'shared digital library'  model  which  is  based  on  the  proven  success  of  cooperative  bibliographic database efforts such as OCLC and RLIN, and involves the creation of bodies of digital documents by undertaking a digital retrospective conversion full-text. It discusses the options of doing serials in the new virtual library, covering choice of format and supply\r\nvehicle, and of acquisitions methods. [64]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcKiernan expresses that while there are many information sources available in the World Wide Web, the identification of significant Internet resources is often not as efficient nor as effective as many would desire. In 1995, a demonstration prototype service,  Cyber  Stacks  (http://www.public.iastate.edu/~CYBERSTACKS/)  was established at Iowa State University to enhance the access and the usage of the selected Internet resources in science, technology and related areas through the application of the Library of Congress Classification Scheme as an organizational framework. It reviews the creation of Cyber Stacks and the methods and techniques for facilitating access to the\r\nWorld Wide Web resources. [65] \r\nGomez presents a survey of the situation of science and technology libraries in Argentine Universities with respect to their capabilities for accessing the electronic information. The state of libraries across the country is uneven, ranging from the libraries with adequate information technology, and consequent access to the services like electronic full text databases or electronic transmission of documents, to those which have only just started input into their first bibliographic databases. It focuses on the developments which are leading to substantial improvement in access to information access, and also on the foundations of this development phase. The latter includes: QUIF programme (Quality Improvement of Universities Fund); University Interconnection Network Project (UIN) (which connects state universities with each other and with the rest of the world); and the science and technology Information workgroup working within MERCOSUR, whose aim is the regional integration in the information area as well as the\r\noptimal use of the available resources. [66]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT Gomez describes the purchasing power of academic libraries in the Netherlands which has declined sharply. In this critical situation the most obvious solution seems to be resource sharing. The electronic infrastructure by which this can be achieved is well organized  in  the  Netherlands,  but  the  availability  of  documents  and  resources  is becoming a problem. The situation is further complicated by the growing importance of information resources in new formats which competes for limited funds. Coordinated collection building aims to broaden the coverage of research holdings by cutting costs through  minimizing  any  unnecessary  overlap  of  specialist  research  publications. However, the collections are still being increasingly restricted only to essential work, so \r\nthe possibilities for exchange appear to be compromised, despite the efficiency of the inter-library loan network. Librarians have to become information specialists to help the end user with both printed and electronic resources. [67]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAni’s describing of the results of the survey show that only six university libraries are fully “computerized”, nine are “about to be computerized”; seven of the surveyed libraries have been installed local area networks, five have online public access catalogue and only four libraries provide internet service. The major obstacles that influence the effective adoption of ICT in university libraries are inadequate funds and the poor state of electricity in Nigeria. [68]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGulati in his paper discusses the status of information and communication technologies usage in Indian libraries with special reference to special libraries and the efforts made by the various institutions to propagate e-information products and services. This paper highlights the consortia efforts in India at NISCAIR, New Delhi, IITM, Kerala, C-DAC Pune, and the Digital Library of India. In addition, it incorporates the details on major information systems in India (such as NISSAT) and the major library networks in India (such as INFLIBNET, DELNET, CALIBNET etc.). The paper concludes with challenges for library and information science professionals and an overview of initiatives taken by the Government of India. [69] \r\nSamuel analysis of the data showed that, on a self-assessment basis, out of about\r\n\r\n268 professional librarians, only 87 (approximately 32 percent) were ICT-literate, implying that the remaining 181 (approximately 68 per- cent) professional librarians were ICT-illiterate.  Out of 358 paraprofessionals in those libraries, only 28 (approximately 8 percent) were ICT-literate, while the vast majority, some 330 (approximately 92 percent), were ICT-illiterate. Out of 1,133 “other” staff members in the survey, a minimal 69 (6 percent)  staff  were  ICT-literate,  while  1,064  (approximately  94  percent)  were  ICT-\r\nilliterate. [70]\r\n\r\n\r\nPatricia A describes that time is very essential for the librarians to review the pace of change occurring within higher education and how information will be provided in academic libraries to their vastly changing student population. The integration of technology in higher education has an impact on academic libraries in two direct ways: changing material formats and the scholarly communication options; and changing how information is delivered, beyond the classroom experience. The authors examine the depth of the format change issues, including changes in data preservation and conversion, personnel and facilities issues, and a close examination of scholarly communication and distance education issues facing by our higher education and academic libraries. [71]\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Stubley reports on the Multimedia in the Libraries Project, which was begun in October 1990, to investigate the specific opportunities that technology offers to the libraries and information centres. It discusses the four multimedia modules included in the prototype covering non-verbal communication, query negotiation, bibliographic search strategies and the feedback of information to the enquirer. It concludes that the \r\nevaluators have appreciated the creative and tongue-in-cheek use of multiple media in this important area. [72]\r\nMaria Laura Bargellini and Luciana Bordoni show that distance learning can be defined, in the most general terms, as a method of education that involves an instructor and student(s), who are separated geographically and must rely on one or more methods of long-distance communication. It is the direct descendant of correspondence and home study courses that were developed in the nineteenth century. What is new, however, is the wealth of telecommunications and telemetries options available today that enables the provision of this high-tech educational environment and the enlargement of the potential user base. Libraries have a central role in education, learning, and vocational training in support of increasing knowledge. The rapid evolution of information and communication technology in the learning field imposes supports and stimulates the re-engineering of the library. This paper provides a description of a new distance learning scenario in a library service. [73]\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip Barker, In the context of information storage and sharing new electronic technology  has  much  to  offer  conventional  library  systems.  A  video  disc  can  be  a valuable storage component. However, its full potential is unlikely to be realised if it is used in isolation from other equipment. Computers, communication networks and video discs can together provide many novel information storage and dissemination systems for using in the libraries. This paper describes some of these and also gives a brief outline of\r\nsome approaches for providing all the important user interface to such systems. [74] \r\nR.P Kumar describes that Indian civilizations is one of the oldest civilizations with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved multi-faceted socio-economic progress during the last 43 years of its independence. As the seventh largest country in the world, India is well marked off from the rest of Asia by the mountains and the sea, which gives the country a distinct geographical entity. India comprises twenty five states and seven union territories. India has made commendable progress   in   the   technological,   engineering   and   communication   fields.   Modern technologies are applied to information handling. Production of hardware and software technology is domestic. National resources are augmented by establishing links with the international systems. There are 106 medical colleges, and 40 dental colleges in India. Besides this, there are nursing colleges, pharmacy colleges and other institutions. Each college/institution has a library of its own attached to it. The libraries can be classified into Medical, Research, Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Dental, Unani and Pharmaceutical Libraries. A survey was carried out on the usage of modern technologies in health science libraries. For example, Photocopiers, microfilming, computers, facsimile transmission, audiovisual, online searching and CD-ROM in the form of a questionnaire. Personal visits  were  made  to  a  number  of  libraries  and  some  of  the  librarians  were  also interviewed.  This  paper  examines  the  impact  of  modern  technologies  on  medical libraries, and concludes with the problems faced by the librarians in adopting the modern technologies  and  suggests  the  need  and  measures  for  implementation  of  modern\r\ntechnologies to health science libraries. [75] \r\nFrances Schofield expresses that the people's network (PN) aims to ensure the provision of free and open access to Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) through public libraries. This paper compares the usage of a PN converted library to an original learning centre. It was found that a wide range of people from different age groups and backgrounds use the ICT facilities. The results also indicated that both the libraries had been successful in providing access to ICTs for people who would otherwise have had no access, although the age of the technology available in the established learning  centre  had  a  negative  impact  on  users,  and  the  take-up  of  online  learning\r\nopportunities had not been as prominent as would be expected. [76]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlayinka Catherine Fatoki describes that the GSM technologies acceptance and growth rate among the Nigerian populace has serious and great potentials for enhancing the communication and information technology-related services in libraries and information centers in Nigeria. However, information managers need to fully exploit the opportunities presented by this relatively new phenomenon with a view to providing improved products and services to the library users, especially in the academic sector. [77]\r\n\r\nDamaris Odero-Musakali expresses that the potential advantages of the internet appear to have precluded the foresight of Kenyan university libraries to the challenges that may be associated with its deployment. There is a clear under-utilization and considerable disparities between and within the libraries in their levels of general Information and Communication Technology (ICT) deployment and the usage in Kenya. Most of the public university libraries are still using the conventional methods of service provision, suggesting that most of the library employees are not ready to embrace and \r\nintegrate these information technologies in their routine operations. ICT applications cannot be widely deployed, and then the benefits resulting from such technologies are likely to be equally curtailed. [78]\r\n\r\nSarah Ormes considers that this paper explores some of the issues surrounding the development of Internet services in public library children's services. It shows that IT services have generally been undeveloped in children's libraries and that this trend must not continue with networked computer services. This paper reveals the fact that the lack of net-worked computer service provision in children's libraries may lead to them to remain ‘irrelevant’ and ‘old fashioned’ to their users. The paper focuses on literature and literacy issues in relation to information and communication technology (ICT). It shows that few libraries have been using ICT to support their literature-based services. One possible  service  model  for  the  integration of  ICT  into  literature  services,  UKOLN's Treasure Island Web site, is described and the results of an evaluation of it has been interpreted. The paper is concluded by looking forward to the Stories from the Web\r\nproject which will develop the Treasure Island model further. [79]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNancy K. Herther’s purpose of this article is to advocate a broader discussion of potential  needs  for  better  communication  and  theory  in  the  areas  of  technological adoption, management and application in libraries and information centres.   From the personal readings, reflection, experience and the insights of others in the field, the paper considers the movements in the larger library and information science (LIS) theoretical literature and its potential application to technology issues.  Numerous areas of potential future research and action in the field are identified to stimulate further discussion and \r\nefforts. Although these newer theoretical discussions have stimulated research and reflection in the few, few discussions have been made in the information technology arena, an area ripe for such consideration [80]\r\nPadmini Srinivasan, understood that knowledge management is extremely important in order to achieve the goals and aspirations of research communities. Traditional knowledge management methods linking different knowledge resources are now  being  augmented  by  newer  models  and  methods  that  have  excellent  potential benefits. The new innovations typically involve creative combinations of technology, human expertise and communication models. Innovations such as digital libraries have attracted  significant  attention,  especially  in  the  publishing  industry.  Some  of  these projects have made the transition from prototypes to production systems, enabling relatively quick and reliable access to research publications. Other innovations such as “Push Technology” or information filtering promise a level of maturity that could offer researchers  a  constellation  of  automatic  electronic  agents  that  assist  with  highly specialized aspects of the research process. This paper examines the developments in some of these innovations and their potential for researchers. [81]\r\n\r\n\r\nSandra Sharp expresses that The library services have developed a learning plan by offering different levels of access to information and communication technologies to give  the  opportunities  to all  and  are  trying  to  expand  on  provision to learning and information technology to vulnerable and hard to reach the groups. [82] \r\nRachel Spacey‘s consideration of the implications of technological change for public library staff and managers in the UK is based on the selected results of a literature review. Recent developments affecting the growth of information and communication technology (ICT) in public libraries provide a context against which research into the effects of automation, the introduction of ICT in a variety of library environments and into society generally, are explored. The values of attitudes to ICT are questioned noting that attitudes are often seen as being important in determining the successful implementation of ICT in libraries. Training is suggested as an appropriate means of enabling staff to cope up effectively with technological change. Successful training is needed to appreciate that staff have different needs and so prefer different training methods. Resistance is also viewed as a natural response to change that managers should\r\nnote and attempt to understand, when it occurs. [83]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHudron  K.  Kari  discussion  of  the  empirical  findings  of  the  research  is  as follows: about 80 per- cent of Nigerians live in rural areas and are predominantly poor farmers and fishermen, of whom about 90 percent are illiterate in the Western sense. They lack basic information infrastructures such as internet, libraries and information centres, and electricity. The oral tradition is still prevalent and written communication remains elusive because a majority of the populace is still illiterate. Rural dwellers show positive response to the services of information agents such as agricultural extension\r\nworkers, rural health workers, etc. [84] \r\nSamuel Olu Adeyoyin expresses that that the result of the findings showed that out of about 370 professional librarians, only 179 of them were ICT literate while the remaining 191 professional librarians were ICT non-literate. This constitutes an overall percentage of 48.38 percent for the literate professionals as against 51.62 percent for ICT non-literate professionals. Also, out of 526 paraprofessionals, only 84 of them were ICT literate  while  the  remaining  442  were  ICT  non-literate.  This  also  constitutes  15.97 percent for the literate paraprofessionals as against 84.03 percent for ICT non-literate paraprofessionals. Other staff totalled 1,471. Only 190 of them were ICT literate while the remaining 1,281 were ICT non-literate. This also constitutes 12.92 percent for the literate  other  members  of  staff  as  against  87.08  percent  for  ICT  non-literate  other\r\nmembers of staff. [85]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSheila Corrall analyses the way that higher education library services are viewed, planned and managed. There must be a change radically if they are to survive and thrive in the future. Advances in technology, economic and political pressures, and socio- demographic factors have combined to create an environment posing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The Joint Funding Councils' Libraries Review has highlighted the need for stronger management and more confident involvement in institutional   planning   and   organizational   change.   Electronic   communication   will transform service provision, with significant shifts towards the distributed networked services, empowering the end-user and offering new roles and responsibilities to information intermediaries. Effective communication between library, computing and academic staff will be essential to ensure relevant and responsive services. New resource models will be required to take account of diverse customer needs and different modes of \r\ndelivery. Organizational structures and management styles must be changed to meet the future needs and human resource development must be given higher priority. Bold leadership will enable the libraries to enhance their strategic role and respond positively to environmental change. [86]\r\nRowena Cullen expresses that the phrase “Digital Divide” has been applied to the gap that exists in most countries between those with ready access to the tools of information and communication technologies (ICTs), and those without such access or skills. This may be because of socio-economic or geographical factors, educational, attitudinal and generational factors, or because of physical disabilities. The paper reviews recent research concerning the digital divide in New Zealand, and the factors that alienate people from enjoying the benefits of information technology and participation in the knowledge economy. While socio-economic factors affect the use of ICTs by urban Maori and Pacific Island communities, and rural communities are affected by inadequate telecommunications infrastructure, rural Maori are even more disadvantaged. The paper examines the strategies used in the USA and the UK at national and regional levels to address similar issues, including the use of libraries to reduce the digital divide, and compares these with New Zealand initiatives, to identify the positive means of increasing the participation in the knowledge economy. [87]\r\n\r\n\r\nRita  Marcella  discusses  the  second  stage  of  a  pilot  study,  funded  by  the Economic and Social Research Council, which investigated the impact of technology on the communication of parliamentary information to the general public. This second stage tested the application of a new data collection tool – an interactive, electronically assisted \r\ninterview delivered in a roadshow environment. The approach was tested in the context of the public's need for information about the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. Interviews were carried out by a researcher, aboard a minibus equipped with a laptop and mobile data transmission equipment, who assisted the members of the public in exploring and responding to parliamentary and devolved Assembly Websites. Roadshows took place across the UK at organisations such as public libraries, community centres, sheltered accommodation and universities. Discusses in critical  detail  about  all  aspects  of  the  execution  of  the  methodology  and  draws\r\nconclusions as to its validity for future research. [88]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuzie Allard shows that knowledge creation relies on melding powerful technological tools with efficient human organizations. Digital libraries (DLs) provide the technological mechanisms to cross the national and disciplinary boundaries, and promote an organizational structure that encourages communication between scholars who are both creating and consuming information. The DL is especially good at coordinating and integrating the findings about a specific topic that is being studied by different disciplines and different nations, which is an essential component to our knowledge. This paper will briefly outline the knowledge creation process, and will introduce the author’s SEEK model (structure for encompassing extensible knowledge) that provides a framework for exploring the relationship between technology and human organizations in the international interdisciplinary knowledge creation. The paper will also introduce two models of electronically-based scholarly organizations that promote \r\ninternational collaboration and facilitate knowledge creation, and will offer eight steps towards building the effective organization for utilizing DLs for international collaboration. [89]\r\n\r\nSunday  Ighovie  Efe  discusses  the  results  and  it  showed  a  low  level  of automation, because only two of the meteorological and weather stations in Nigeria are automated. The study also revealed that CLICOM software is very effective in weather information management. Similarly, the result showed that the CLICOM software is highly useful in the making of weather maps, charts and for quick dissemination of weather data, map and other information to students, university and public libraries who request such information. The reasons for the low level of automation were attributed to a lack of funds, faulty equipment and obsolete computer systems. It is therefore highly recommended for the Nigerian government to make use of the available fund for the automation of the Nigerian meteorological stations and weather stations in Nigerian universities  to  ease  data  management  and  dissemination  of  weather  information  in\r\nNigeria. [90]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.M. Khalid, A range of factors has provided the facilities for the maximum use of technology in libraries. This application has marked a new era for library services. A postal survey confirms its lesser use in the university libraries of Saudi Arabia (less than the UK and Malaysia for example) for housekeeping and bibliographic searching. A literature review points out a number of reasons for this lower use, for example, non- existence of a national information policy and the lack of trained staff. Usage can be \r\nincreased by taking initiatives by professional organisations and Government agencies. Among these, planning of technology, implementing information policy, developing broader awareness for the use of technology in libraries, establishing staff training and development and user education programmes are particularly important. [91]\r\n\r\nMohamed Haneefa analyses that though the libraries had hardware, software, and communication facilities to some extent, ICT-based resources and services were not reaching the users to the expected extent. Library automation in special libraries in Kerala was largely commenced during the period 1990-2000. CDS/ISIS was used more in the libraries than any other software. The library catalogue found to be the most popular area for automation. The ICT-based resource used by the largest percentage of the users was the e-mail. Most of the libraries were hampered by lack of funds, lack of infrastructure, and lack of skilled professionals to embark on automation of all library management activities and application of ICT. A good number of the library users were not satisfied with   the   application   of   ICT   in   their   libraries   and   indicated   “Inadequate   ICT Infrastructure”  as  their  major  reason  for  dissatisfaction.  They  proposed  a  variety  of\r\nmeasures of formal orientation and training on ICT to become more effective users. [92]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR.B. Okiy expresses that Identified obstacles militating against effective application of ICT in university libraries to include inadequate funding, inadequate electricity supply, shortage of competent manpower for operation and maintenance of ICT facilities, lukewarm attitude of the Nigerian government towards the provision of ICT facilities and low level of computer literacy among the Nigerians. [93] \r\nA.A. Oduwole analysis of the returned questionnaire revealed that 16 federal universities and two state universities have automated their cataloguing processes by using the TINLIB software, while two others use the LC and CD-ROM database to aid the cataloguing. Automation of the cataloguing process has increased the efficiency of the cataloguing processes in the Nigerian university libraries, which in turn has resulted in increased productivity. The high cost of maintenance of the TINLIB software was identified as the major constraint to the use of the software. Other constraints include poor computer literacy on the part of the librarians, incessant power-cuts and lack of\r\ninfrastructures. [94]\r\n\r\n\r\nBrendan Fitzgerald explains that article explores the impact on public libraries in Victoria, Australia, as they become increasingly reliant upon information communications technology (ICT) to manage access and deliver information services. Libraries Online and Rural Libraries Online have, since 1998, been developing Internet access  in  Victorian  public  libraries.  Funded  by  State  (Multimedia  Victoria)  and Australian Federal (Networking the Nation) and delivered by VICNET, a division of the State Library of Victoria, these projects have provided a library approach to e-services which includes provision of bandwidth, infrastructure, ICT skills, and content. The specific projects such as satellite delivery of bandwidth, rural points of presence (POPs), Victoria’s Virtual Library, the Gulliver Consortium and the SWIFT Initiative are discussed. His critical aligning of the actual ICT models and implementations is the capacity of the 44 individual public library services to understand and meet the ongoing issues. [95] \r\nLisa J. Barlow studied a survey undertaken between January and March 1998 which investigated the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in a sample  of  120  industrial  and  commercial  libraries.  Ninety-six  per  cent  of  the organisations which responded to the questionnaire use computers for some aspect of their library and information services. ICT was used for a range of office and other applications including, in rank order, e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets, presentation packages and database management systems. Ninety-one per cent of the sample were used for various Internet facilities including e-mail, World Wide Web, file transfer protocol (ftp) and telnet. This paper describes the results of the survey, reporting on the\r\ncurrent state of the art of ICT use and future plans for automation in the sample. [96]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMa Ziwei studied In China, explained that libraries can be grouped into three major categories: (1) The public libraries, headed by the National Library of China and including the provincial, municipal, prefectural, and country libraries; (2) The academic libraries under the control of the Ministry of Education, including the university and college libraries and middle and elementary school libraries; and (3) The libraries of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Academic Sinica), including the science and research libraries. Academic libraries play a very special role in the country among these groups of libraries and are becoming increasingly important, as they are at the centre of information and education on each campus (May 1989). [97] \r\nJustin  Chisenga  contributes  to  the  discussion  on  the  impact  of  Global Information on Africa with specific emphasis on libraries in sub-Saharan Africa. This indicates that the impact of GI on libraries in Sub-Saharan Africa is closely linked to the status of information technology application in libraries and the state of electronic connectivity in the countries of the Sub-Region. With the current general low level of computerisation and electronic connectivity in libraries in most of the countries in the region, the impact of GI can be noticed mainly in the libraries of the Republic of South Africa, where the state of economic development and information technology infrastructure is the way ahead of the rest of the sub-continent. Libraries in South Africa are using the Internet for electronic publishing and provision of and access to electronic information services for the library users. Most of the libraries in other countries, which have established full Internet access, only have access to e-mail facilities, and are not exploiting the facilities fully. He concludes that, unless libraries are properly funded, equipped, and well staffed, they will not be able to take advantage of the Internet access being established in sub-Saharan Africa and will consequently be left out in the race for\r\nthe establishment of a Global Information infrastructure. [98]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElisam Magara’s analyses of the application offered by different organisations in Uganda and give a way forward for the usage of digital libraries. A qualitative approach with a purposive sampling strategy was adopted. The study was limited to practical experiences on the services and applications that made the basis of analysis. The results indicated that the majority of organisations apply IT in bridging access across networks \r\nand sharing of information between different organisations. It was observed that the current ICT systems in Uganda do not enable it to reach the majority of the community. It is concluded that digital libraries and electronic technologies have contributed effectively to collaborative applications among the institutions in Uganda. The author recommends that services need to be integrated into the organisations strategic objectives coupled with knowledge and skills. [99]\r\n\r\nAlemna, M. Cobblah studied that Africa is ready to pursue developing digital libraries in a more earnest way but lacks some basic resources. Information technology is expanding  throughout  Africa  but  at  a  slower  pace,  yet  with  intense  efforts  directed towards training and implementing more automation. [100]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarian Shemberg explains that in the late 1997 / early 1998’s, we conducted a survey  dealing  with  library  provision  of  electronic  journals  and  other  electronic resources.  We  compared  the  responses  from  a  census  of  Association  of  Research Libraries (ARL) to a sample of non-ARL Master’s, Doctoral, and Research institutions. Of the 299 libraries surveyed, 250 surveys were returned for the response rate of 83.6 percent. Analysis of the responses emphasizes the number and types of computers available in libraries, electronic resources in libraries, past and future cancellation decisions and archiving responsibilities. It was determined that both ARL and non-ARL libraries offer extensive electronic services to their constituents. Libraries are beginning to cancel the paper journals in favour of electronic versions. There is a little consensus\r\nabout who will archive electronic journals. [101] \r\n\r\n\r\nDan Arbour expresses that Information Technology is fueling a revolution in the US libraries. UMI's market survey shows that the proliferation of CDROM, database licensing and computer networks are allowing the information professionals to provide extraordinary new levels of service to a variety of researchers. [102]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR.T. Mulimila discusses the information environment of a given society currently revolves around the ability to use and manipulate information technologies. This paper reviews the trend of information technology (IT) applications in East Africa government- owned university libraries for the ten years (1987-1997). By 1997, East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) had only eight government-owned university libraries. The trend of IT applications in those libraries was surveyed by using a questionnaire and the review of available literature. It was revealed that the extent of IT applications in those libraries from 1987-1997 was very limited. By 1997, only one government-owned university library in East Africa had automated its library catalogue and books circulation control. Financial resources and lack of trained manpower in IT remained the most critical obstacles in the application of information technology in East Africa government-owned\r\nuniversity libraries. [103]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRowena Cullen analysis revealed that new technologies in reference and information work place increasing the demands on reference staff to acquire skills with the technology itself, to develop and evaluate new services and sources, and to train the users in their optimal use. These demands for new skills create the training needs among the staff offering the services. This paper reports on a survey carried out in the libraries of \r\nGuangzhou  and  Wellington  that  investigated  the  use  of  technology  to  provide information services in these libraries, the training that had been provided and areas where libraries felt there were still unmet needs for training. Although Chinese libraries were  using  a  similar  range  of  technologies,  training  programmes  and  needs  varied between Chinese and New Zealand libraries. [104]\r\n\r\nMuhammad Ramzan discusses that the utilisation of information technology (IT) has become an indicator of a country's wealth level. Countries, which fail to prepare for information technology and do not use it properly, are likely to lose their global competitiveness.  Muslim countries  have  paid  little  attention  to  leverage  the  benefits offered by the IT usage in their library and information centres. The first part of this paper  reports  the  status  of  information  technology  applications  in  libraries  and information centres of Muslim countries. The second part of the paper reports the level of hardware, software, and IT-based resources available in the libraries and information centres in Pakistan. The third part of this paper discusses the problems hindering the wider use of information technology in the libraries and information centres in Pakistan. Based on the findings of the survey and documentary research the final part of this paper puts forward overall suggestions to solve the problems by hindering the wider use of information technology in the libraries and information centres in general, and in Muslim\r\ncountries in particular. [105]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKinengyere, Alison Annet has revealed that Uganda has gone a step forward in ensuring that information resources available for researchers and students are maximally utilized. Academic and research libraries are participating by supporting and achieving \r\nthe missions of their respective institutions by teaching the competency of information literacy (IL).  This paper seeks to examine the effect of IL that has had on the usage of electronic information resources in academic and research institutions in Uganda.  It aims to focus on the innovations that Makerere University Library (the biggest and oldest academy library in Uganda) has undertaken to ensure that library users (the Makerere University community and other collaborating universities and research institutions in Uganda) are trained on how to access a variety of available information resources, evaluate the information and apply it to address their needs. Data were collected for the study by conducting interviews to both the   library staff and the users of the selected institutions: two library staff in charge of e-resources and ten students / researchers were interviewed from each institution.  However, user’s statistics for the years 2004-2005, as well as the IL training sessions conducted, were the main sources of information.  The study focused on academic and research institutions- Makerer University, Uganda, Martyrs University, Nkozi and National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS)\r\n\r\nThe researcher is physically involved in the IL program in Makekrere University. The usage statistics were compiled and interpreted.  The paper finds out the availability of information which does not necessarily mean the actual use.   The study shows that some of the available resources have not been utilized at all.  This means that users are not aware of the availability of such resources, they do not know how to access them, or they do not know what the resources offer.  Their attitudes and perceptions also influence the level of utilization.   The paper shows the extent of information literacy and its influence on electronic resources in Uganda.  It points out the challenges for the future and provides a number of recommendations for the way forward, which will be helpful, \r\nboth  to  the  relevant  communities  in  Uganda  and  to  other  academics  in  similar circumstances. [106]\r\n\r\nMiroslaw Górny reports that the results of an inquiry were directed to Polish academic, research and scientific libraries. An appraisal of the current IT infrastructure, degree of advances in automation of libraries, and utilization of the electronic sources has been carried out, based on the completed questionnaires received from the libraries in question. It has been recognized that the best developed IT infrastructure is to be found in the academic libraries and that they are well prepared for automation. The situation is much worse in the special libraries of the research and scientific institutes. Half of the libraries in the latter group are not engaged in any preparation for automation, mainly owing to a lack of financial resources. Also, they do not provide the readers with access to the sources in an electronic format. He points out that a relevant consistent programme for the implementation and utilization of IT in Polish libraries has not yet been prepared.\r\n[107]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish Library Research and Development of Library automation programme supports the research which is aimed at improving the efficiency of library operations through the usage of computer systems and other forms of automation. It includes: the evaluation of applications of Information Technology in libraries and information units; investigating various methods of storing, retrieving and processing library records; and improvement of library systems to make them more effective and simpler to use. It also provides  support  for  various  information  and  demonstration  services  to  provide  the\r\nlibrarians with data about library automation to aid their decision making. [108] \r\nR. Olorunsola states that the use of information technologies in the provision of information and communication in the libraries has had a far-reaching effect on the librarians and the library users. He points out that the provision of information can be made more effective and efficient with the use of electronic information, and examines the extent to which electronic information sources have been used in Nigerian libraries. The  paper  reveals  that  there  is  nothing  to  show  a  widespread  or  intensive  use  of electronic information in Nigerian libraries. It identifies some problems facing the application and the usage of electronic information sources and proffers suggestions on\r\nhow to overcome them. [109]\r\n\r\n\r\nSyed Sajjad Ahmed reported that an e-mail survey of seven Arabian Gulf University Libraries was conducted in order to ascertain which types of Web-based services they offer to the users. The study specifically looked at the provision of access to the Web-based services such as Catalogues, Search Engines, Forms, etc. through the respective library Web sites. Findings showed that almost all the libraries are offering Web-based services to the users in one way or the other. This paper also discusses the ways to improve and reinforce the provision of such Web-based services, including effective methods of creating awareness and delivering the orientation and necessary training to create a positive environment for change. Finally, the results of the study may be helpful especially to the librarians of the Arabian Gulf libraries in enhancing or developing quality web-based services. [110] \r\nR.B. Okiy discusses the second stage of a pilot study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, which investigated on the communciation of parliamentary information to the general public. This second stage tested the application of a new data collection tool – an interactive, electronically assisted interview delivered in a road shows the environment about the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. Interviews were carried out by a researcher, abroad a minibus equipped with a laptop and mobile data transmission equipment, who assisted the members of the public in exploring and responding to parliamentary and devolved Assembly Websites. Road shows took place across the UK at organisation such as public libraries, community centres, sheltered accommodation and universities. He discusses in critical  detail  about  all  the  aspects  of  the  execution  of  the  methodology  and  draws\r\nconclusions as to it validity for future research. [111]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuzie Allard explains that knowledge creation relies on melding powerful technological tools with efficient human organizations. Digital Libraries (DLs) provide the technological mechanisms to cross the national and disciplinary boundaries, and promote an organizational structure that encourages communication between the scholars who are both creating and consuming information. The DL is especially good at coordinating and integrating the findings about a specific topic that is being studied by different disciplines and different nations, which is an essential component to our knowledge. This paper will briefly outline the knowledge creation process, and will introduce the author’s SEEK model (structure for encompassing extensible knowledge) that provides a framework for exploring the relationship between technology and human organizations in international interdisciplinary knowledge creation. [112] \r\nSunday Lghovie Efe results showed a low level of automation because only two of the meteorological and a weather station in Nigeria is automated. The study also revealed that CLICOM software is very effective in weather information management. Similarly, the result showed that the CLICOM software is highly useful in the making of weather maps, charts and for quick dissemination of weather data, map and other information to students, university and public libraries who request such information. The reason  for  the  low  level  of  automation  was  attributed  to  the  lack  of  funds,  faulty equipment and obsolete computer systems. It is therefore highly recommended for the Nigerian government to make use of the available fund for the automation of the Nigerian meteorological and for the automation of the Nigerian government and for the automation of the Nigerian meteorologcal stations and weather stations in Nigerian universities to\r\nease data management and dissemination of weather information in Nigeria. [113]\r\n\r\n\r\nSheila Corrall, discusses   the way that higher education library services are viewed, planned and managed. There must be a change radically if they are to survive and thrive in the future. Advances in technology, economic and political pressures, and socio-demographic factors have combined to create an environment by posing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The joint funding councils Libraries Review have highlighted the need for stronger management and more confident involvement in institutional   planning   and   organizational   change.   Electronic   communication   will transform service provision, with significant shifts towards the distributed networked services, empowering the end-users and offering new roles and responsibilites to information intermediaries. Effective communication between library, computing and academic staff will be essential to ensure the relevant and responsive services. [114] \r\nRowena Cullen says that the phrase “Digital Divide” has been applied to the gap that exists in most of the countries between those with ready access to the tools of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and those without such access or skills. This may be because of socio-economic or geographical factors, educational, attitudinal and generational factors, or because of physical disabilities. The paper reviews the recent research concerning the digital divide in New Zealand, and the factors that alienate people from enjoying the benefits of information technology and participation in the knowledge economy. While socio- economic factors affect the use of ICTs by Urban Maori  and  Pacific  Island  Communities,  and  Rural  Communities  are  affected  by inadequate telecommunications infrastructure, rural Maori are even more disadvantaged.\r\n[115]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBakari’s  research  is  about  the  improvement  of  the  ICT  security  management process  in  non-commercial  organisations  in  order  to  reduce  the  possible  financial damage,  taking  into  consideration  the  realities  found  in  developing  countries.  The research took place in a developing country -Tanzania, where five organisations were involved [116]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeansupap’s  study  is  organised  into  seven  papers  covering:  The  state  of  ICT security management in the organisations; Prerequisites while utilising the existing ICT security management approaches in attaining a solution for managing ICT security in the organisations; Issues and challenges of managing ICT security; Important aspects to be taken into consideration in order to successfully manage ICT security; and how the \r\nmanagement  of  ICT  security  in  non-commercial  organisations  could  be  improved. Among the others, the research was motivated by the observed need for bridging the perception gap between the management and technicians while dealing with the ICT security problem, and consequently extending to a common understanding by the staff in the various departments and specialties within and among the departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thesis contributes to the increased empirical knowledge on the importance of the holistic ICT security management process. Particularly, our main contribution is the proposed holistic approach for managing ICT security in non-commercial organisations, organised in the form of guidelines with two main phases: the initialisation phase which involved the introduction of the ICT security management process in the organisation; and the internalised and continuous phase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research aims to understand the nature of ICT diffusion at the intra- organisational level. It uses both quantitative and qualitative research approaches to identify   the   factors   and   the   process   influencing   ICT   diffusion   at   the   actual implementation phase. The result indicates that management, individual and technology group factors are essential to ICT diffusion at the initial adoption stage. In addition, the integration  of  change  management  and  knowledge  sharing  and  learning  theory  to diffusion of innovation theory can help to better explain ICT diffusion at the actual\r\nimplementation stage. [117] \r\nWaller expresses that there is an interdisciplinary qualitative study which uses an exploratory research design and builds on Fariclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis methodology to analyze the discourses surrounding an Information and Communication Technology  (ICT)  for  livelihood  development  project  in  Jamaica,  introduced  by  the United Nations Development Programme – the Jamaica Sustainable Development Networking Programme (JSDNP). The primary objective of this project is to provide the poor in Jamaican communities with access to, and training in ICTs. In this research, I specifically focus on the discourses surrounding the JSDNP Cyber centre Project for a group of micro enterprise entrepreneurs in the Jamaican tourism industry to access the epistemological assumptions of this project. From the data collected it was found that at one level, the JSDNP Cyber centre Project encouraged the specific ways of acting and organizing the congruent with the configurations, processes and structures of corporate firms of industrialized countries, by representing the achievement of livelihood expansion through the use of specific ICTs in a particular way which excluded other discourses. The particular ways of acting and organizing promoted by the Cyber centre encouraged the use of non-indigenous technologies, undervalued indigenous technologies and excluded the indigenization of non-indigenous technologies. These discourses were incompatible with   the   operational   and   the   structural   configurations   of   trans-temporal   poor entrepreneurs interviewed and were more favourable to the non-poor and patio-temporal ones. One of the wider implications of the discourse therefore was that they play a fundamental role in perpetuating the entrenched inequalities through the preservation of social practices, along with their associated systems and structures. It was also found that these modalities limited the operational processes of all micro enterprise entrepreneurs \r\nwho were exposed to the Cyber centre Project. These entrepreneurs have limited control over the configuration of non-indigenous technologies; their technological and creative capabilities are restricted; their ability to indigenize the non-indigenous technologies are impaired; and they are highly dependent on non-indigenous technologies (which themselves have a number of limitations).

answers for the questions through the application of specific procedures. Research design is the basic framework,  which  provides  guidelines  for the research  process.  It is a map  or blueprint according to which the research is to be conducted. “A research design is the arrangement of conditions for collection and analysis of data in a manner that aims to combine relevance to the research purpose with economy in procedure”.\r\n\r\nResearch  design  is  needed  because  it  facilitates  the  smooth  sailing  of various research operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.5 SAMPLING PLAN\r\n\r\nThe sampling  plan is the one in which they have specified  the different ways in which  the research  work should  be done. An integral  component  of a research design is the sampling plan, specifically, as it addresses three questions - Whom to survey (the sampling unit), how many to survey, (the sample size) and how to select them (the sampling procedure). \r\nIn  Vellore  District  there  are  1  Government  University,11  Engineering\r\n\r\nColleges,19 Arts and Science colleges, 2 Medical Colleges, 1 Agriculture College,\r\n\r\n3 Nursing Colleges. Out of 37 educational institutions, one university, 19 Arts and Science  College  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  convenient  by  sampling.  The researcher has distributed each 200 questionnaires among the selected educational institutions on random sampling and as per the requirement of the objectives of the present study. The scholar requests the university library users (Students, Research Scholars  and  faculties)  to  fill  the  questionnaire  as  per  their  convenience  and returned the questionnaire  to the investigator  as early as possible. The filled up questionnaire  has been collected from the respondents  for the data analysis and interpretation. Research scholars refer to the students doing either M.Phil, or Ph.D. The selected institutions and the number of respondents from each institution are as follows: \r\nTable  3.1\r\n\r\n\r\nS.No\t\r\nName of Institution\tNo. of Questionnaire Issued\tNo. of Questionnaire Received\t\r\nPercentage of Received\r\n1\tThiruvalluvar University\t200\t156\t78.00%\r\n\r\n2\tArignar Anna Govt.

For the researcher’s convenient only 216 respondents were for analysis purpose with the respect in the ratio of 1:15 (Lottery method).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.6 DATA ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  filled  in  questionnaires  were  arranged  in  University  and  Arts  and Science Colleges wise and an analysis was made on the basis of Gender, Faculty and Status. Simple percentage analysis was made in all the questionnaires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.7 STATISTICAL TOOL\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the data collection, the filled in questionnaires were edited  properly  to make them for coding.  After  coding,  the data were fed into computer and database was created. From the database, the required tables were prepared for further analysis by using SPSS Ver 15.0.\r\nThe  analysis  part  employed  suitable  statistical  techniques  to  the  data collected and tabulated. Keeping in mind, the nature of the present study, the following statistical tools are used:\r\n1.   Simple percentage score\r\n\r\n2.   ANOVA test\r\n\r\n3.   Chi-square test\r\n\r\n4.   Co-efficient of Correlation\r\n\r\n5.   Graphs. \r\nExplanations to some of the statistical techniques applied to the data of the present study are presented here.   The t-test assesses whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other.\r\nCross-tabulation (contingency, cross-tabulation, or cross-tab tables) is a combination of two (or more) frequency tables arranged such that each cell in the resulting  table  represents  a  unique  combination  of  specific  values  of  cross- tabulated variables. Thus, cross-tabulation allows us to examine the frequencies of observations that belong to specific categories on more than one variable.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that main effect A has a levels (and A = a-1 df), main effect B has b levels (and B = b-1 df), n is the sample size of each treatment, and N = abn is the total sample size. The overall degrees of freedom are once again one less than the total sample size.\r\n\r\nChi-square is a statistical test commonly used to compare the observed data with  data  one  would  expect  to  obtain  according  to  a  specific  hypothesis.  For example, suppose according to Mendel's law, the expected 10 of 20 offspring from a cross to be male and the actual observed number is 8 males. Then one wants to know  about the \"goodness  to fit\" between  the observed  and the expected.  The investigator must conclude that something other than chance is at work, causing the observed to differ from the expected.   That is, chi-square is the sum of the squared  difference  between  the observed  (o)  and  the  expected  (e) data  (or  the deviation, d), divided by the expected data in all possible categories.\r\nA measure of the strength of linear association between two variables. Correlation will always between -1.0 and +1.0. If the correlation is positive, we have a positive relationship. If it is negative, the relationship is negative. \r\nFormula:\r\n\r\nCorrelation Co-efficient :\r\n\r\nCorrelation(r) =[ NΣXY - (ΣX)(ΣY) / Sqrt([NΣX2  - (ΣX)2][NΣY2  - (ΣY)2])]\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\nN = Number of values or elements\r\n\r\nX = First Score\r\n\r\nY = Second Score\r\n\r\nΣXY = Sum of the product of first and Second Scores\r\n\r\nΣX = Sum of First Scores\r\n\r\nΣY = Sum of Second Scores\r\n\r\nΣX2 = Sum of square First Scores\r\n\r\nΣY2 = Sum of square Second Scores\r\n\r\n3.8 PERIOD OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\nThe period of coverage of the present study spans between 2009 and 2010. Data  collection  was  started  during  the  month  of  September  2009  and  was completed in the month of November 2010.\r\n3.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\nThe  study  is  confined  to  the  student,  research  scholar  and  the  faculty members  of  Vellore  District  Thiruvalluvar  University  and  Arts  and  Science Colleges.  The  present  study  does  not  identify  paraprofessionals  as  a  separate category   and   instead   included   them   under   the   generic   label   of   Library professionals.  There are studies that included their impact on e-resources  usage, satisfaction and implementation.  But, the present study does not include the family and other environments or their benefits external to the workplace related variables excepting the marital/single status of the employees. \r\nCHAPTER – IV\r\n\r\n\r\nDATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data, after collection, has to be processed and anlaysed in accordance with the outline laid down for the purpose at the time of developing the research plan.  This  is essential  for  a scientific  study  and  for ensuring  that  we  have  all relevant  data  for  making  contemplated  comparisons  and  analysis.  Processing implies editing, coding, classification and tabulation of collected data so that they are amenable to analysis. The term analysis refers to the computation  of certain measures along with searching for patterns of relationship that exist among data- groups.\r\n\r\nThus, “in the process of analysis, relationships or differences supporting or conflicting with original or new hypotheses should be subjected to statistical tests of significance  to determine with what validity data can be said to indicate any conclusions”.\r\n\r\nThis chapter deals with analysis  and interpretation  of the collected  data. The analysis of data requires a number of closely related operations, such as establishment  of  categories,  application  of  these  categories  raw  data  through coding, tabulation and the drawing inferences. Interpretation is the process of explaining the findings on the basis of some theory \r\n4.1 GENDER WISE RESPONDENTS\r\n\r\nTable 4.1\r\n\r\nGender Wise Respondents\r\n\r\n\r\nGender\tNo. of\r\nRespondents\t\r\nPercentage\r\n\r\nMale\t\r\n138\t\r\n63.9\r\n\r\nFemale\t\r\n78\t\r\n36.1\r\n\r\nTotal\t\r\n216\t\r\n100.0\r\nSource: Primary data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the above table it is evident that 63.9 percentages of the respondents are Male and 36.1 percentages of the respondents are Female.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHART 4.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATEGORY WISE COMPOSITION OF\r\nRESPONDENTS IN SURVEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMale    Female \r\n4.2 AGE WISE RESPONDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAge wise Respondents\r\n\r\n\r\nAge\t\r\nNo. of Respondents\t\r\nPercentage\r\n\r\nBetween 15 – 25 Years\t\r\n36\t\r\n16.7\r\n\r\nBetween  26 - 35 Years\t\r\n84\t\r\n38.9\r\n\r\nBetween 36 – 45Years\t\r\n54\t\r\n25.0\r\n\r\nBetween 46 – 55Years\t\r\n21\t\r\n9.7\r\n\r\nAbove 56 Years\t\r\n21\t\r\n9.7\r\n\r\nTotal\t\r\n216\t\r\n100.0\r\nSource: Primary data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study clearly points out that majority of the respondents belong to the age group between 26 and 35 Years and their score is 84 (38.9 %), 54 (25.0%) respondents come under the age group between 36 and 45 Years, 36 (16.7%) respondents come under the age group between 15 and 25 years, 21(9.7%) respondents belong to the age group between 46 and 55 years and the remaining\r\n21(9.7%) respondents belong to the age group of above 56 years. \r\nCHART 4.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE WISE RESPONDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90\r\n84\r\n\r\n\r\n70\r\n\r\n60\r\n54\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36\r\n30\r\n\r\n20                                                                                21                 21\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n0 \r\n4.3 QUALIFICATION WISE RESPONDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4.3\r\n\r\nQualification wise Respondents\r\n\r\n\r\nQualification\t\r\nNo. of Respondents\t\r\nPercentage\r\n\r\nUG Degree\t\r\n30\t\r\n13.9\r\n\r\nPG Degree\t\r\n69\t\r\n31.9\r\n\r\nResearcher\t\r\n33\t\r\n15.3\r\n\r\nProfessional\t\r\n84\t\r\n38.9\r\n\r\nTotal\t\r\n216\t\r\n100.0\r\nSource: Primary data\r\n\r\nCHART 4.3\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION  WISE RESPONDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUG Degree     PG Degree     Researcher     Professional \r\n\r\n\r\nIt can be observed from the above table 4.3 that, Out of 216 total respondents,84  (38.9%)  respondents  are Professional  degree  holders,  69(31.9%) respondents are post graduates, 33(15.3%) respondents are Researcher and the remaining 30 (13.9%) respondents are under graduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is concluded  from the above table that Professional  and Post graduate students are utilizing the e-resources facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.4 OCCUPATION WISE RESPONDENTS Table 4.4\r\nOccupation wise Respondents\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupation\t\r\nNo. of Respondents\t\r\nPercentage\r\n\r\nU.G Student\t\r\n24\t\r\n11.1\r\n\r\nP.G Student\t\r\n69\t\r\n31.9\r\n\r\nResearcher\t\r\n21\t\r\n9.7\r\n\r\nFaculty\t\r\n84\t\r\n38.9\r\n\r\nOthers\t\r\n18\t\r\n8.3\r\n\r\nTotal\t\r\n216\t\r\n100.0\r\nSource: Primary data \r\nCHART 4.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION WISE RESPONDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n84\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n69\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n0       10      20      30      40      50      60      70      80      90\r\n\r\n\r\nU.G Student         P.G Student         Researcher        Faculty         Others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 4.4 displays  the Career-wise  distribution  of the respondents.

In  order  to  achieve  the  objects,  a  questionnaire  was  prepared  and circulated to the students, research scholars and the faculty members of Vellore District Thiruvalluvar University and Arts and Science Colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe analysis has been made for 216 respondents, which included 138 male\r\n\r\n78 female respondents  with regard to gender form educational  institutions.  The findings of the present study lead to the following observations.\r\n\r\n5.1SUMMARY OF FINDINGS\r\n\r\n•   Gender wise Respondents\r\n\r\nFrom the table 4.1 it is evident that 63.9 percentages of the respondents are\r\n\r\nMale and 36.1 percentages of the respondents are Female.\r\n\r\n•   Age wise Respondents\r\n\r\nThe study clearly points out that majority of the respondents belong to the age group between 26 and 35 Years and their score is 84 (38.9 %), 54 (25.0%) respondents come under the age group between 36 and 45 Years, 36 (16.7%) respondents come under the age group between 15 and 25 years, 21(9.7%) respondents belong to the age group between 46 and 55 years and the remaining\r\n21(9.7%) respondents belong to the age group of above 56 years. \r\n•   Qualification wise Respondents\r\n\r\nIt can be observed from the table 4.3 that, Out of 216 total respondents,84 (38.9%) respondents  are Professional degree holders, 69(31.9%) respondents  are post  graduates,  33(15.3%)  respondents  are  Researcher  and  the    remaining  30 (13.9%) respondents are under graduates.\r\nIt is concluded  from the above table that Professional  and Post graduate students are utilizing the e-resources facility.\r\n•   Occupation wise Respondents\r\n\r\nTable 4.4 displays  the Career-wise  distribution  of the respondents.   It is found  that  84  (38.9  %)  of  the  respondents  are  found  to  be  employed  as  the Teaching  Faculty,  69(31.9%)  of  the  respondents  are  Post  Graduate  Students,\r\n24 (11.7%) of the respondents are Under Graduate Students and 21 (9.7%) of the respondents are Researcher (M.Phil / Ph.D Scholar) and the remaining 18 (8.3%) respondents are found to be Non-Teaching Staff.\r\n•   Family Income wise Respondents\r\n\r\nTable  4.5  reveals  the  different  categories   of  salary  received  by  the respondents covered under the study. It is found that 84 (38.9%) of the respondents receive    above   15000  per  month  while  75(34.7%)  of the  respondents  receive between   10001-     15,000 per month.   Further it is found that 57(26.4%) of the respondents  receive  the sum of     5001-   10000  per month  and no respondents receive Up to   5000 as their salary.\r\n•   Living Place wise Respondents\r\n\r\nThe table 4.6 shows that 108 (50.0%) of the respondents belong to Semi- urban area, 60 (27.8%) of the respondents belong to urban area and the remaining\r\n48 (22.2%) of the respondents belong to Rural background. \r\n•   Gender wise Classification of Period of Usage\r\n\r\nTable 4.7 indicates that, Out of 216 respondents, 63 male respondents are using the e-resources for 2 to 4 years. 60 respondents are using the e-resources for\r\n4  to  6  years.  Among  these  24  respondents  are  male  and  the  remaining  36 respondents are female.\r\n•   Gender wise Classification of Frequency of Usage\r\n\r\nIt is observed from the table 4.8 that, 111 (51.4%) respondents are using the e-resources  daily.  Out  of  111  respondents  75  respondents  are  male  and  36 respondents are female. 45 (20.8%) respondents are using twice in a week, among these, 33 respondents are male and 12 respondents are female.30 (13.9%) of the respondents are using once in two days. Among these, 18 respondents are female and 12 respondents are male. 18(8.3%) of the male respondents are using once in two weeks and the remaining 12(5.6%) of the female respondents are using once in a week.\r\n•   Gender wise Classification of Time to Access\r\n\r\nIt is inferred from the table 4.9 that, out of 216 respondents, 80 (37.04%) of the respondents  are  accessing  at night  only,  among  these  21.76  percent  of the respondents are male and 15.28 percent of the respondents are female. 66 (30.56%) of the respondents are accessing only in the evening. Among these 18.06 percent of the  respondents  are  female  and  12.50  percent  of the respondents  are  male.  49 (22.69  %)  of  the  respondents  are  accessing  at  late  night.  Among  these  22.22 percent of the respondents are male and 0.46 percent of the respondents are female.\r\n14(6.48%)  of the respondents  are accessing  in the afternoon.  Out of these 5.09 percent  of  the  respondents  are  male  and  the  remaining  1.39  percent  of  the respondents are female. 7(3.24%) of the respondents are accessing in the morning. \r\nOut of these  2.31  percent  of the respondents  are male and the remaining  0.93 percent of the respondents are female.\r\nIt is concluded that maximum number of the respondents are working at night and in the evening.\r\n•   Gender wise Classification of Time Spending\r\n\r\nThe table 4.10 explains that, 96 (44%) of the respondents are spending the time for e-resources only one hour per day. Out of these 96 respondents, 78 respondents are female and 18 respondents are male.\r\n72 (33.3 %) of the male respondents are spending the time for e-resources two hours per day.\r\n36(16.7%) of the male respondents are spending the time for e-resources three hours per day.\r\n12(5.6%)  of the male respondents  are spending  the time for e-resources above three hours per day.\r\n•   Gender wise Classification of Purpose of Usage\r\n\r\nThe table 4.11 reveals that, 81 (37.5%) of the respondents are using the e- resources  for  studying  purpose.  66  (30.6%)  of  the  respondents  are  using  e- resources  for improving  the teaching  ability, 27 (12.5%) of the respondents  are using the e-resources for exchanging of various ideas to gather new information.\r\n24(11.1%) of the respondents are using the e-resources for the completion of their research  work.  12  (5.6%)  of  the  respondents  are  using  the  e-resources  for publishing journals, articles and books. 6 (2.8%) of the respondents are using the e-resources for other purpose. \r\n•   Age wise Analysis of Accessing E-resources at Libraries\r\n\r\nFrom the Table 4.12 it is evident that, Out of 100 % of the respondents,\r\n\r\n77.78 % of the respondents  are using the e-resources  at libraries.  Among these\r\n\r\n29.17 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 26- 35 years. 20.83 % of the respondents  belong to the age group of 36- 45 years. 11.1% of the respondents belong to the age group of 15-25 Years. 9.72 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 46-56 years and the remaining 6.94% of the respondents belong to the age group of above 56 years.\r\nOut of 22.22 % respondents, 9.72 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 26-36 years. 5.6 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 15-25 years.  4.17 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 36-45 years. 2.78% of the respondents belong to the age group of above 56 years.\r\nCorrelation Result\r\n\r\nThe   correlation   analysis   reveals   that   the   co-efficient   of   correlation   is Insignificant and therefore there is a significant relationship between accessing the e-resources at libraries and not accessing the e-resources at libraries.\r\n•   Age wise Analysis of Accessing E-resources at Open Access Centre\r\n\r\nTable 4.13 shows that, Out of 100 % of the respondents, 66.96 % of the respondents are using the e-resources at open access centre, among these 28.70 % of the respondents belong to the age of 26- 35 years. 15.28 % of the respondents belong to the age of 36- 45 years. 10.6% of the respondents belong to the age of\r\n15-25 Years, 5.56 % of the respondents belong to the age of 46-56 years and the remaining 2.78 % of the respondents belong to the age group above 56 years.\r\nOut of 37.03 % of the respondents, 10.18 % of the respondents belong to the age of 26-36 years.9.72 % of the respondents belong to the age of 36-45 years. \r\n6.94%  of  the  respondents   belong  to  the  age  above  56  years.6.1%   of  the respondents  belong  to  the  age  of  15-25  years  and  remaining  4.17%  of  the respondents belong to the age of 46-55 years.\r\nCorrelation Result\r\n\r\nThe   correlation   analysis   reveals   that   the   co-efficient   of   correlation   is Insignificant and therefore there is a significant relationship between accessing the e-resources at centre and not accessing the e-resources in the centre.\r\n•   Age wise Analysis of Accessing E-resources at Home\r\n\r\nThe Table 4.13 shows that, Out of 100 % of the respondents, 86.57 % of the respondents are using the e-resources at Home. Among these 30.56 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 26 to 35 years. 22.22 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 36 to 45 years. 16.2% of the respondents belong to the age group of 15 to 25 Years, 9.72 % of the respondents belong to the age group of\r\n46 to 56 years and the remaining  7.78 % of the respondents  belong to the age group of above 56 years.\r\nOut of 13.43 % of the respondents, 8.33 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 26 to 36 years.2.78 % of the respondents belong to the age group of\r\n36 to 45 years. 1.85 % of the respondents belong to the age group above 56 years and the remaining.0.5 % of the respondents belong to the age group of 15-25 years.

For instance, Directory open access journal is a free website which covers full text, quality controlled scientific and scholarly journals in all subjects and languages.\r\n•\tThe speed of internet needs to be increased for quickly accessing available resources.\r\n•   Qualified internet knowledge should be needed for the user.\r\n\r\n•\tLibrarian should take more initiative in participating on-line consortium for fulfillment of information need of the users and improving the online collection of the library.\r\n•\tThe  Libraries   at  higher  education   get  exposure   in  e-resources.   The University   Grant   Commission   information   library   network   is  in  the forefront  of automation  of academic  libraries  in Indian  Universities  and colleges.   Software   of   University   Libraries   has   been   brought   and successfully  running in many colleges  of various states in India. Hence, library portal with appropriate tools is essential.\r\n• \r\n5.3 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study proved that the usage of the faculty members in the Educational Institutional of e-resources was not at the anticipated level that would effectively enhance the learning and research process as stated in the mission statement of the Librarianship. Significant low usage was reported for e-books, bibliographic databases  and  e-journals.  These  attitudes  might  be  a  result  for  the  lack  of awareness about the e-resources provided by the library or due to the ineffective channels of communication  in campus as reported in the earlier research. Some respondents  have  missing  values  in  the  question  about  frequency  of  using  the e-resources; this might be explained as the lack of awareness of the participants about the resources provided by the library.\r\n\r\nResults  of  this  survey  obviously  ascertained  the  opinion  that  faculty members should be equipped with fairly good computer skills which will enable them  to  search  and  utilize  the  e-resources.  It  seems  that  the  possessions  of computer skills alone are not adequate for efficient use of the e-resources. Hence more organized training programs are needed to familiarize  some of the faculty members with the e-resources, even though the results didn’t explicitly show that there   was   a  severe   lack   of  training   or  that  librarians   offered   insufficient bibliographic instruction.\r\n\r\nThis research did not support the prevailing notion that faculty members in the humanities  and social sciences use the e-resources  less frequently  than their counterparts in economics and engineering. There was no significant difference in the  usage  across  the  colleges  of  the  campus,  with  the  College  of  Engineering \r\nhaving the least usage. The latter finding was interesting and opened a window for further research to clarify this peculiar situation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it can be said that in view of credibility, the  internet and e- resources  have  exponentially  changed  the  way  people  communicate,  interact, acquire, sharing knowledge, search, investigate and participate in creation and re- use of the content and prompted to bring the revolutionary changes in almost all the spheres of activities of present day education and learning system and evolved broadly a collaborative  structure  over the ground and pillars of a range of new technological tools and techniques. On the use of internet and e-resources reported that all users use internet as a source of information  and the common problems they mostly encounter are erratic power supply, low internet bandwidths and inadequate full-text journals need adequate steps for extensive use of e-resources. The label of information and communication technology (ICT) has been attached to new capabilities  and the services are offered by the second generation  world wide web (www).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.4 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY\r\n\r\nThere is a significant improvement in the usage of e-resources among the teaching community. The recommendations with be submitted to Government for consideration   and   implementation.   The   study   has   been   undertaken   among professional education only restricted to every district in Tamilnadu.   This can be extended all types of educational institutions and for entire Tamilnadu. \r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n•\tP. L.
