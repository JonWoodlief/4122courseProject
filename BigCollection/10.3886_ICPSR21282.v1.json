Pearson and  Robert A. Baumann (1993). This newer study documents 447 intervention  events from 1989 to 2005. To ensure consistency across the full  1946-2005 time span, Pearson and Baumann's coding procedures were  followed. The data collection thus \"documents all cases of military  intervention across international boundaries by regular armed forces  of independent states\" in the international system (Pearson and  Baumann, 1993). \"Military interventions are defined operationally in  this collection as the movement of regular troops or forces (airborne,  seaborne, shelling, etc.) of one country inside another, in the  context of some political issue or dispute\" (Pearson and Baumann,  1993). As with the original IMI (OIMI) collection, the 1989-2005  dataset includes information on actor and target states, as well as  starting and ending dates. It also includes a categorical variable  describing the direction of the intervention, i.e., whether it was  launched in support of the target government, in opposition to the  target government, or against some third party actor within the target  state's borders. The intensity of the military intervention is  captured in ordinal variables that document the scale of the actor's  involvement, \"ranging from minor engagement such as evacuation, to  patrols, act of intimidation, and actual firing, shelling or bombing\"  (Pearson and Baumann, 1993). Casualties that are a direct result of  the military intervention are coded as well. A novel aspect of IMI is  the inclusion of a series of variables designed to ascertain the  motivations or issues that prompted the actor to intervene, including  to take sides in a domestic dispute in the target state, to affect  target state policy, to protect a socio-ethnic or minority group, to  attack rebels in sanctuaries in the target state, to protect economic  or resource interests, to intervene for strategic purposes, to lend  humanitarian aid, to acquire territory or to dispute its ownership,  and to protect its own military/diplomatic interests. There are three  main differences between OIMI and this update. First, the variable,  civilian casualties, which complements IMI's information on the  casualties suffered by actor and target military personnel has been  added. Second, OIMI variables on colonial history, previous  intervention, alliance partners, alignment of the target, power size  of the intervener, and power size of the target have been deleted. The  Web-based resources available today, such as the CIA World Fact Book,  make information on the colonial history between actor and target  readily available. Statistical programs allow researchers to generate  all previous interventions by the actor into the target state. Since  competing measures and data collections are used for alliances and  state power, it was thought best to allow analysts who use IMI the  freedom to choose the variables or dataset that measure the phenomena  of their choice. Third, the data collection techniques differ from  OIMI. OIMI relied on the scouring of printed news sources such as the  New York Times Index, Facts on File, and Keesing's to collect  information on international military interventions, whereas the  computer-based search engine, Lexis-Nexis Academic, was used as the  foundation for the new study's data search. Lexis-Nexis Academic  includes print sources as well as news wire reports and many others.  After Lexis-Nexis searches were conducted for each year in the update  by at least four different investigators, regional sources, the United Nations Web site, and secondary works were consulted."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"domestic policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international conflict"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military intervention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national interests"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XI.D.
