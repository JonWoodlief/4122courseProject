The first  survey was conducted before President Bill Clinton's State of the  Union address on January 25, 1994. The second survey was conducted  after the address and included respondents from the original sample as  well as new respondents. Questions were the same for both  surveys. Respondents were asked for their opinions of Bill Clinton\nand  the way he was handling issues such as foreign policy. They also were  asked whether the health care reform plan Clinton proposed was fair to  people like them and whether they would be willing to pay more taxes  if the federal government paid everyone's health care costs. In  addition, respondents were asked to rate the condition of the United  States economy. Background information on respondents includes voter  registration status, household composition, vote choice in the 1992  presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
