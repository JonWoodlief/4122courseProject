Respondents were asked  if they thought exposure to the sun was good or bad for their health,  how best to protect themselves from the sun, what type of skin, eye,  and hair color they had, and what information they had received about  the \"Europe Against Cancer\" campaign. In regard to the Common European  Currency, they provided their attitudes toward having one currency for  all member states, and commented on how well-informed they were about  this issue, if they knew about the conditions that member countries  must meet in order to join the European Economic and Monetary Union,  if their own country would be able to meet the requirements and what  the consequences would be if it did not, when euro coins and notes  might be introduced, how the introduction of the single currency  should proceed, and how it would affect economic policies and  transactions. Questions about energy use and consumption covered  problems that could affect the environment, if respondents had made  attempts to conserve energy use in recent years and how they might do  so in the future, how effective public bodies were in saving energy,  and whether energy investment decisions should be left to market  forces or to public bodies. Views regarding the availability and cost  of energy resour\nces over the next ten years, the importance of nuclear  energy, the role of taxes in energy consumption, and whether public or  private transportation should be favored in traffic planning decisions  were also elicited. A battery of questions about developing countries  focused on whether respondents thought there was a need to help poorer  countries to develop, whether their own governments provided  development aid, whether the European Commission provided such aid and  if so, how much, and whether such aid should be increased or  decreased. Other questions probed for opinions on whether developing  countries used aid money to purchase goods from the EU, whether the  Community's aid should be made better known, and how profitable it was  to invest in developing countries. Respondents were also asked if they  thought Europe, the United States, or Japan was best placed to help  poor people, where Europe's exports were sent, if development aid  helped to solve certain social and economic problems, and if they felt  they received accurate accounts about developing countries from  newspapers and television news programs. A few questions also focused  on perceptions of the rights of citizens of the EU and where  information could be located about such rights. Citizens from Germany,  Spain, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom were asked about their  attitudes toward other EU countries, which countries should join the  Monetary Union, how important the introduction of the single currency  by January 1, 1999, was, and how likely it was that the deadline would  be met. Demographic items included age, gender, marital status,  household size, monthly income, education, size of community, region, and occupation."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"energy consumption"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"euro"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign aid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Economic and Monetary Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international assistance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"monetary policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
