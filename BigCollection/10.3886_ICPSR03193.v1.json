It was fielded January 11-15, 2001, just  prior to the end of the Bill Clinton presidency. Respondents were  asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his  handling of the economy, foreign affairs, race relations, the welfare  system, crime, and the health care system. A series of questions  focused on Clinton and his presidency, including whether Clinton was  honest and trustworthy, possessed high personal moral and ethical  standards, understood the problems of the American people, had kept  the economy strong, had been a strong leader, how he would go down in  history, whether the House of Representatives was right to impeach  him, and whether he should be charged with a crime for giving false  testimony in 1999 regarding his relationship with White House intern  Monica Lewinsky. Respondents were asked which of the following issues  should be given the highest priority by incoming president George  W. Bush and Congress: maintaining a strong economy, protecting the  Social Security system, holding down the costs of health care/health  insurance, keeping the federal budget balanced, reducing the use of  illegal drugs, reforming campaign finance laws, reducing political  partisanship in Washington, DC, raising pay and benefits for military  personnel, improving opportunities for women and minorities, cutting  taxes, improving education, expanding health care coverage, helping  the elderly pay for prescription drugs, protecting the environment,  upgrading military systems and equipment, banning partial-birth  abortions, establishing uniform standards for presidential elections,  and improving race relations. A series of questions focused on the  incoming Bush administration. Respondent views were sought on Bush's  nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general, Bush's nomination of  Gale Norton for secretary of the interior, whether Bush was  legitimately elected as president, whether Bush had a mandate to carry  out his campaign promises, what type of president Bush would be, and  Bush's handling of the presidential transition. Those queried were  also asked whether they thought Bush would work for or against the  following interest groups: labor unions, large corporations, the poor,  the wealthy, the middle class, women's rights groups, the military,  environmental groups, religious conservatives, Blacks or  African-Americans, Hispanics, other racial and ethnic minorities, and  white males. A series of questions on the economy covered whether the  economy was headed toward a recession, respondent stock investments,  whether stock investments were safe, whether the market would go up or  down next year, whether changes in the stock market personally  affected the respondent, and what type of tax cut they would  prefer. Additional topics covered respondent views on homosexuals  serving in the military, gun control laws, abortion, school voucher  programs, the construction of a missile defense system, drilling for  oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, energy  conservation vs. finding new energy sources, preferential treatment of  minorities and women, tobacco companies, and mad cow  disease. Background information on respondents includes age, gender,  political party, political orientation, voter participation history,  education, race, Hispanic origin, labor union membership, household income, and whether the respondent ate beef."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton Administration (1993-2001)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign affairs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leadership"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lewinsky scandal"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"welfare services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
