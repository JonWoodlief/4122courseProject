Respondents were asked to describe relations between the two countries, to predict whether overall relations would get better in the next four years, and to indicate whether their own feelings toward the Japanese were friendly. Those surveyed were asked whether Japanese companies were competing unfairly with American companies, whether the United States or Japan would be the number one economic power in the next century, whether trade with Japan was good for the United States economy, and if most Japanese respected Americans and vice versa. Concerning Japan's international role, respondents were asked if Japan had a responsibility to give military assistance in trou\nble spots around the world when asked by its allies, and if Japan had a responsibility to give financial assistance to military peace-keeping efforts around the world. Other topics addressed include George Bush's handling of his job as president, the national economy, corruption in government, the effect of a Clinton presidency on the economy and on relations with Japan, the use of United States troops in Somalia, and whether the time was right for buying a new car or house. Background information on respondents includes sex, age, race, education, religious preference, military service, family income, voter registration status, vote choice in the 1992 presidential election, political orientation, and party preference."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
