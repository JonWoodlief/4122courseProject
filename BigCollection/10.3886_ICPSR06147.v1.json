A focal point of the study was to investigate how local jail  systems (designed for short-term inmates) handle gang problems, as compared with state prison systems (designed for long-term inmates)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The jail portion of the study focused on the jail  system, a local jurisdiction with two or more detention facilities for  housing offenders, rather than concentrating on a jail facility, which  was defined as one building. The local jail system was further  subdivided into four classifications: (1) mega-jail systems, which had  bed capacity ratings that exceed 1,000 beds, (2) large systems, which  had ratings between 500 and 1,000 beds, (3) medium systems, which had  ratings between 250 and 499 beds, and (4) small systems, which had  ratings between 0 and 249 beds. For the 73 selected jail systems,  letters were mailed to sheriffs or correctional administrators  informing the participants of the scope of the project and bearing  the signature of the American Correctional Association's (ACA's) executive  director. An additional letter  encouraging participation was sent with the survey. For the 52  prison systems, initial contacts to individuals at the correctional  system were made by telephone. During the telephone conversation,  project staff verified that the contact person was the appropriate  person to receive the survey, and also explained to the individual  the scope of the project. In states where a contact person had  not been specified, project staff called the agency directly to  identify one. Letters bearing the ACA executive director's  signature were also sent to each agency head to introduce that  individual to the project's intent. The letter identified the contact  person at that correctional system who would be receiving the  survey. The agency head was given the option of designating that the survey  be sent to someone other than the selected contact person. Respondents  to the mail survey included 55 local jail systems and 52 state prison  systems (the 50 state Departments of Corrections, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau\nof Prisons)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The survey instrument was divided to collect data  from four sections. The statistical information section provided data  on total inmate population, number of STGs, number of inmates  identified as members of STGs, and number of inmates in STGs who had  been identified as confirmed, suspected, associate, or drop-out  members. The second section contained two survey items dealing with  violence: total number of violent incidents during the past  year directed at staff and directed at inmates, and the number of  violent incidents perpetrated by STG members. The third section sought  to identify management tools or strategies to deal with  STGs. Respondents were asked if their system had a centralized unit  responsible for monitoring STGs, or if the system had established  policies and procedures or rules and regulations concerning STG  activity. Respondents were also asked about methods used to control  members of STGs. The last section sought to identify names of STGs  operating in correctional systems. Respondents could choose from a list  of 39 known STGs and could also name other STGs known within their  system. Information was also collected on whether the correctional  system had either formal and informal means of communicating with other agencies about STGs."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"correctional facilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gang members"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gangs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"inmates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policies and procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
