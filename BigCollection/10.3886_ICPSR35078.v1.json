All participants were at least 18 years of age or older. Participants from the Beth Israel Medical Center and the Lower East Side were given face-to-face interviews based on a World Health Organization Multi-Centre questionnaire. Data from the Bellevue Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program were extracted from patients' clinical files. Minimal demographic and HIV risk behavior were included in the methadone patient responses in these data to protect their anonymity. Blood samples were taken from participants to test for HIV.</p>\n\n<p>These data also contain information on topics including participant demographics, alcohol use, drug use, substance abuse treatment, needle sharing habits, sexual behavior, social networks, HIV testing services, as well as mental and physical health.
