Theory from psychology suggests that emotions should affect how citizens perceive and process information about repression risk and ultimately whether or not they dissent. I test the effects of emotions on dissent in autocracy by running a lab-in-the-field experiment with 671 opposition supporters in Zimbabwe that randomly assigns some participants to an exercise that induces a mild state of fear, whereas others complete a neutral placebo. The fear treatment significantly reduces hypothetical and behavioral measures of dissent by substantively large amounts. It also increases pessimism about parameters that enter into the dissent decision as well as risk aversion. These results show that emotions interact in important ways with strategic considerations. Fear may be a powerful component of how unpopular autocrats exclude large portions of their populations from mobilizing for regime change."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-11-28"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Young, Lauren. 2018. \"The psychology of state repression: Fear and dissent decisions in Zimbabwe.\" American Political Science Review."},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3F1E1A2B675D4137C7CA8B4162FDE544/S000305541800076Xa.pdf/psychology_of_state_repression_fear_and_dissent_decisions_in_zimbabwe.pdf"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Young, Lauren"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-11-29"}]}},"files":[{"description":"zip file with subdirectories:\r\n01_Data\r\n02_Code\r\n03_Graphs\r\n04_Instrument","label":"ReplicationFiles_Dataverse.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":147510,"dataFile":{"id":3320310,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/UNNCTR/VWFHUP","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UNNCTR/VWFHUP","filename":"ReplicationFiles_Dataverse.zip","contentType":"application/zipped-shapefile","filesize":8359419,"description":"zip file with subdirectories:\r\n01_Data\r\n02_Code\r\n03_Graphs\r\n04_Instrument","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16761754dee-aa9a9812a628","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"60b203d15165b1a12bd7c5921255a1bb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"60b203d15165b1a12bd7c5921255a1bb"}}}]}}}
