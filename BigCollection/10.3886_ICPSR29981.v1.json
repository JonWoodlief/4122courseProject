The \"scattered sites\" consisted of single and multifamily homes located near other public housing redevelopment sites. However, due to substantial overlap between the various target sites and displacement zones, the research team ultimately decided to aggregate the three sites into a single target area. A comparison area, Westlawn, was then chosen based on recommendations from the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee (HACM) of sites with similar housing stock, populations, residency requirements, and crime levels.</p>\n\n<p>In Washington, DC, two HOPE VI sites were selected for inclusion in the study: Capitol  Gateway and Arthur Capper/Carrollsburg. Both redevelopment sites had clearly delineated boundaries. Based on recommendations from the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), the research team selected Barry Farms and Syphax/Greenleaf Gardens as the comparison sites for Capitol Gateway and Arthur Capper/Carrollsburg, respectively. Census data (not included in this dataset) revealed that the comparison sites had demographic and socioeconomic characteristics similar to those of their respective HOPE VI counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>Displacement areas were then drawn as concentric rings (\"buffers\") around the target areas in both Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Washington, DC. Specifically, two zones for displacement were delineated for each site: one ring that was 1000 feet from each site, and a circle that was 2000 feet from each site. The two buffer areas were mutually exclusive; that is, the area contained in the 2000 foot buffer did not include the area captured by the 1000 foot buffer. In Milwaukee, because the aggregated target zone was so large, the area contained in a 3000 foot buffer surrounding Westlawn, the comparable public housing development, was used as the comparison area. In Washington DC, only the actual areas of the comparison public housing sites were used.</p>\n\n<p>Address-level incident data were collected for the city of Milwaukee from the Milwaukee Police Department for the period January 2002 through February 2010. Incident data included all \"Group A\" offenses as classified under National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS).
