The  first, initial classification, used the sum of four variables to  arrive at a security score, which was taken to be predictive of  violence. The second, reclassification, used the sum of seven  different variables to obtain a custody total, which was then used as  a major determinant of reclassification. Two groups of inmates were  used: inmates who had committed infractions and inmates with no  reported infractions. Research variables include (a) initial  classification: offense (severity), expected length of incarceration  (sentence), type of prior commitments, and history of violence, and  (b) reclassification: percentage of time served, involvement with  drugs/alcohol, mental/psychological stability, most serious  disciplinary report, frequency of disciplinary reports, responsibility  that the inmate demonstrated, and family/community ties. In addition,  the collection supplies information on race and sex of inmates,  sentence limitation, history of escapes or attempts, previous  infractions, entry, reclassification, and termination dates (month and  year), and custody level.

In the early 1980s, the state  of Hawaii began classifying its prisoners with a newly developed  Federal Bureau of Prisons classification instrument. The goal of this  study was to estimate the validity of this new classification  instrument using Cox's Proportional Hazards model. The results were  then compared to a more traditional statistical procedure to  demonstrate the advantage of the new method in predicting  violence. Two prediction models, one at intake and one after six  months in prison, were used to evaluate the difference between the  traditional and the new methods. The first model, initial  classification (security total), used the sum of four variables and  was the only method that would be used for classification purposes for  the first six months. This security total was taken to be predictive  of violence. After this time, the reclassification prediction model  (custody total) was applied, using the sum of seven different  variables. This custody total variable was used as a major determinant  of reclassification. The two groups of inmates used were (1)  infractors, all inmates who had committed an act of violence while in  the institution from 1977 to September 1980, and (2) noninfractors, a  sample selected from the group of individuals who did not commit major violations during the time period."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Two inmate samples were drawn from the Hawaii  State Prison case files. The infractors group was composed of 57  inmates who had\ncommitted an act of violence while in the institution.  A noninfractors group of 106 inmates was selected from the individuals  who had not committed a major violation during their incarceration.  For the infractors, a classification form was filled out for the  semiannual evaluation period immediately preceding each incident, and  for the evaluation period after the last incident. For the  noninfractors, one form was filled out for the semiannual evaluation  period immediately preceding the sampled time. The variable SECTOT  (the sum of the four initial classification variables) was the major  predictor of violence and was used to fit a proportional hazards model  to predict the initial incident of violence. In addition, a stepwise  analysis was run using the original variables rather than the SECTOT variable as a further check."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Research variables include (a) initial  classification: offense (severity), expected length of incarceration  (sentence), type of prior commitments, and history of violence, and  (b) reclassification: percentage of time served, involvement with  drugs/alcohol, mental/psychological stability, most serious  disciplinary report, frequency of disciplinary reports, responsibility  that the inmate demonstrated, and family/community ties.
