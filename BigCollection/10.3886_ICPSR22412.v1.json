Work-related variables describe the place and conditions of employment, including the degree of supervision, placement within the workplace hierarchy, and the complexity of work with people, data, and things. Respondents also were questioned regarding job satisfaction, expectations for the future, job security, and union membership and activities. Additionally, respondents provided a complete work history for all jobs held for six months or more. Respondents who were parents at the time of the interview were queried regarding parenting practices and parental values, including methods of child discipline and reinforcement employed, and the level of educational achievement and future occupation preferred for their children. In addition, respondents were asked to select the most and least desirable qualities for their children from a prepared list of attributes. Respondents also were questioned regarding social orientation and self-concept. To measure social orientation, respondents were asked to state the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements indicating authoritarian or nonauthoritarian tendencies, different criteria of morality and amorality, trustfulness and distrustfulness, and statements indicating receptivity or resistance to change. Self-concept was examined by questions concerning self-confidence, self-deprecation, anxiety, fatalism/mastery, and the degree to which respondents believe their ideas conform to those of others. Respondents also were asked to select the values most and least desired for themselves and their children. Background information collected for respondents and their families includes household composition, metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area of residence, marital status and duration of marriage, education, ethnicity, religion, country of birth and year of immigration, wife's age and employment status, grandparents' occupations, and parents' country of birth, occupation, education, and age when the respondent was born. Also recorded were the number of brothers and sisters with whom the respondent grew up, the occupation of each sibling, whether the respondent lived with his parents and what his parents' occupations were when he was 16, the age and education level of each child living in the respondent's household, and the respondent's social class self-placement."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child rearing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cognitive functioning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational background"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marital status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parent child relationship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parenting skills"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self concept"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self esteem"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DATAPASS I.
