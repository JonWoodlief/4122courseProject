Methodological developments in data visualization techniques have improved the ability to convey meaning and reduce erroneous conclusions. The purpose of this project is to examine: (1) How are empirical results presented visually in social work research?; (2) To what extent do top social work journals vary in the publication of data visualization techniques?; (3) What is the predominant type of analysis presented in tables and graphs?; (4) How can current data visualization methods be improved to increase understanding of social work research? Method: A database was built from a systematic literature review of the four most recent issues of Social Work Research and 6 other highly ranked journals in social work based on the 2009 5-year impact factor (Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Knowledge). Overall, 294 articles were reviewed. Articles without any form of data visualization were not included in the final database. The number of articles reviewed by journal includes : Child Abuse\n& Neglect (38), Child Maltreatment (30), American Journal of Community Psychology (31), Family Relations (36), Social Work (29), Children and Youth Services Review (112), and Social Work Research (18). Articles with any type of data visualization (table, graph, other) were included in the database and coded sequentially by two reviewers based on the type of visualization method and type of analyses presented (descriptive, bivariate, measurement, estimate, predicted value, other). Additional revi\new was required from the entire research team for 68 articles. Codes were discussed until 100% agreement was reached. The final database includes 824 data visualization entries."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-08"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"methodology"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"data visualization"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social work research"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Development Research Group"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"McGill University School of Social Work"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.mcgill.ca/socialdevelopment/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-08"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/resources/images/dvnPoweredByLogo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-08"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-08-06"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"International"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["na"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Codebook","label":"1902.1_22046_DataVisualization_cdbk.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":55702,"categories":["Codebook"],"dataFile":{"id":2442419,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"1902.1_22046_DataVisualization_cdbk.txt","contentType":"text/plain; charset=US-ASCII","filesize":658,"description":"Codebook","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:117648","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"34dc49a06767ca9226765fcd86248576","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"34dc49a06767ca9226765fcd86248576"}}},{"description":"Database","label":"1902.1_22046_swdatavis_finaldb_1.tab","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":55702,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2442418,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"1902.1_22046_swdatavis_finaldb_1.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":156563,"description":"Database","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:117647","originalFileFormat":"application/x-rlang-transport","originalFormatLabel":"R Data","UNF":"UNF:5:ick5BZ/cDn+eufOOE/cT8w==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"9a309728d9fd60cb5add8cfbb9f5a833","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"9a309728d9fd60cb5add8cfbb9f5a833"}}}]}}}
