Residents were polled on the biggest problems facing the county,  whether things were going in the right or wrong direction, the quality  of the public schools, whether the budget for public schools should be  increased, decreased or maintained, and whether respondents would  favor or oppose a tax increase if the money benefited the county's  public schools. Views were sought on the quality of life in Prince  George's County and whether it had improved, worsened, or stayed the  same in the past ten years, whether respondents expected it to improve  in the next ten years, what they liked the most and the least about  living there, whether they would rather live somewhere else in the  Washington area, and if so, where. Respondents were asked about the  status of race relations in Prince George's County, whether it was  improving, worsening, or staying the same, and how important it was  that most people in their neighborhood shared their racial  background. Questions regarding the Black and White populations of  Prince George's County asked whether each group had too much, too  little, or the right amount of influence in county politics, whether  this influence was changing, and whether it would be better for the  county if the population of these groups increased, decreased, or  stayed the same. Residents were polled on the likelihood that they  would vote in the upcoming Democratic primary election, their opinions  of the candidates for county executive (Wayne Curry, Sue V. Mills,  Artie Polk, and Beatrice Tignor), which candidate they would vote for,  how strongly they supported him or her, how often they trusted county  government to do what was right, and how important it was that the  next county executive, school superintendent, or police chief elected  was Black. Respondents also gave their impressions of Maryland  gubernatorial candidate Parris Glendening, county attorney Robert  Ostrom, and council member Richard Castaldi. Background variables  include sex, age, education, religion, ethnicity, marital status,  household income, number of children in household, political  orientation, political party affiliation, voter registration and  participation history, length of residency in Prince George's County, and previous residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"county government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Maryland"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political campaigns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"primary elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public schools"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"racial attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
