Methods of hernia repair currently involve prosthetic mesh applications. The aim of this study is to compare the Lichtenstein repair and Mesh-plug repair methods in the surgical treatment of indirect inguinal hernias and to identify which of these two techniques is superior regarding its conferred advantages.\r\nMethods:In this study, a total of 102 patients who were diagnosed with indirect inguinal hernia between the years 2014 and 2015 without a previous operation were analyzed. Patients undergoing Lichtenstein repair and Mesh-plug repair were compared, especially during operation time, hospital stay, postoperative pain and other aspects.\r\nResults:The mean age of patients was 28.7 years (19 - 73). The mean duration of operations and hospitalizations was significantly shorter in patients who had undergone Mesh-plug repair. Inguinal pain in the operation area on postoperative day 1, 2 weeks and 6 months was significantly less in patients who had undergone mesh plug repair. Patients were followed-up for two years. \r\nConclusion:We concluded that Mesh-plug repair was superior to Lichtenstein repair regarding postoperative pain, quality of life of the patient, shorter duration of operation, and duration of hospital stay although the two methods were similar regarding both recurrence and complication rates. Considering this information, we suggest that Mesh-plug repair can be used safely for the treatment of indirect inguinal hernias.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-04-27"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inguinal hernia, Mesh-plug repair, Lichtenstein repair"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MeSH"},"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Comparison Of Lichtenstein Repair And Mesh Plug Repair Methods In The Treatment Of Indirect Inguinal Hernia"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"url"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"111YU4qfunApho2WU14tqiFE5mi3T5sB5"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=111YU4qfunApho2WU14tqiFE5mi3T5sB5"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The research article is in the publication stage and the investigation is continuing."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Destek, Sabahattin"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-04-26"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Full Text Article","label":"Comparison Of Lichtenstein Repair And Mesh Plug Repair Methods In The Treatment Of Indirect Inguinal Hernia.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136598,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":3147992,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MBAL6G/TV96LW","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MBAL6G/TV96LW","filename":"Comparison Of Lichtenstein Repair And Mesh Plug Repair Methods In The Treatment Of Indirect Inguinal Hernia.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":266938,"description":"Full Text Article","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16303e7d0a1-f4b5cf1aca89","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1fe754990a2587f73d23a7cd7c9fab2f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1fe754990a2587f73d23a7cd7c9fab2f"}}},{"description":"Statistical data ","label":"Research Data-Comparison Of Lichtenstein Repair And Mesh Plug Repair Methods In The Treatment Of Indirect Inguinal Hernia.docx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136598,"categories":["Data","Statistical data "],"dataFile":{"id":3147991,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/MBAL6G/VYSBLO","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MBAL6G/VYSBLO","filename":"Research Data-Comparison Of Lichtenstein Repair And Mesh Plug Repair Methods In The Treatment Of Indirect Inguinal Hernia.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":38843,"description":"Statistical data ","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16303e6a264-4720614a478b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"001e640be98117db7e94ef24d4e0ef36","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"001e640be98117db7e94ef24d4e0ef36"}}}]}}}
