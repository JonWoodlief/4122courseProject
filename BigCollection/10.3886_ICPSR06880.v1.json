Sampling was restricted to Long Form sampled individuals with baccalaureate or higher college degrees who, as of April 1, 1990, were age 72 or younger. A total of 4,728,000 individuals met these criteria, from which 214,643 were selected for the NSCG sample. The sample design can be described as a two-phase stratified random sample of individuals. Phase 1 was the Long Form sample design (a stratified systematic sample). Phase 2 was a subsampling of Long Form cases, which used a stratified design with probability-proportional-to-size, systematic selection within strata. The Long Form sampling weight was used as the size measure in selection to achieve, as close as possible, a self-weighting sample within Phase 2 strata. Phase 2 strata were based on demographic characteristics, highest degree achieved, occupation, and sex. The minimum sampling rate was 3.00 percent, but most strata were sampled at rates between 2.03 and 2.82 percent. Successively lower rates were used for each of the following groups: whites with bachelor's or master's degrees and a science and engineering (S\n&amp;E) occupation, nonwhites with bachelor's or master's degrees and a non-S&amp;E occupation, non-foreign-born doctorate recipients, and whites with bachelor's or master's degrees and a non-S&amp;E occupation. The 1993 NSCG achieved an unweighted response rate of 78 percent, yielding 148,932 interviews with individuals having baccalaureate-or-higher degrees and identifying an additional 19,224 cases ineligible for interview (e.g., deceased, over 75 in 1993, no bachelor's degree as of April 199\n0, no longer living in the United States)."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"National Survey of College Graduates, 1993","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41403,"dataFile":{"id":2660269,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"National Survey of College Graduates, 1993","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
