The researcher investigated: 1) the possible sex differences in stress, illness, and the stress-illness relationship; and 2) the influence of demographic factors, behavior types, and coping styles on the relationship.\n<br /><br />The sample was comprised of 47 women and 54 men who were graduates of the Boston University Masters of Business Administration program. The participants were from the middle class, with an age range from 27 to 51. The majority of the sample was married. The men had more children than the women, and most were married to nonworking wives. All of the married women were members of dual-career couples.<br /><br />The participants completed mailed questionnaires that included the following\nmeasures: a Life Patterns Questionnaire (demographic information, work and life satisfaction, ca\nreer aspirations and commitment, and spouse support); the Recent Life Changes Questionnaire; the Job-related Tensions Index; a Health and Habits Survey; a Coping Strategies Scale; and the Vickers Rating Scale (type A/B personality pattern).\n<br /><br />The Murray Archive holds additional analogues materials for this study (completed questionnaires).
