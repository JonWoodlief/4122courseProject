The time diary data were gathered through three  different data collection methods: mail-back, telephone, and personal  interviews. Respondents were instructed to describe in the diaries  when the activity began, the time the activity ended, where it  occurred, and who was present when the activity took  place. Demographic variables include household type, respondent's sex,  marital status, age, educational level, occupation, and work hours,  number of children in the household under 5 and 18 years of age, and  household income. Other variables focus on total work time, total time  for meals at work, total minutes at work engaged in nonwork  activities, total work break in minutes, and total time traveling to  and from work. Data are also provided on total time spent on meal  preparation and cleanup, housecleaning, outdoor chores, laundry,  ironing, clothes care, home repair, baby care, child care, shopping  for food, and traveling to and from food shopping. Respondents also  reported total time spent on personal care, medical care, family  financial activities, and sleeping, as well as time spent attending  school, classes, seminars, special interest group meetings, religious meetings, sports events, and other social activities."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family work relationship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housework"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leisure"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"lifestyles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recreation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social interaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"time utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.B.

All  members of the participating households aged 12 and over were sent  mail-back diaries. A total of 2,921 mail-back diaries were completed  and returned by adults aged 18 and over. The telephone survey  consisted of a random sample of the adults who were contacted in the  first phase of the random-digit dial sample. A total of 1,210  telephone diaries were completed by this group. Thirdly, a separate  national sample of 808 diaries were collected through personal in-home  interviews. This sample was drawn from a subset of 20 primary sampling  units (PSUs) drawn at random from the continuing national samples of  the Institute for Survey Research at Temple University in  Philadelphia. That stratified sample was further stratified and  subjected to \"controlled selection\" to ensure that the subset of 20  PSUs retained sufficient representation by rural-urban-suburban  character within each of the four regions of the country. Weights are  included to adjust the three different samples so that the proportion  of full-time working males and females matches 1985 Census Bureau  figures. In addition, males were weighted slightly up and females  slightly down to correct for the slight underrep\nresentation of male respondents. The weights also control for day of the week."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Americans' Use of Time, 1985","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35608,"dataFile":{"id":2613708,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Americans' Use of Time, 1985","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
