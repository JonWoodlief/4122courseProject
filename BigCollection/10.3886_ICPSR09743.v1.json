The survey was conducted in five federal judicial districts in   the United States: Eastern Wisconsin, Eastern Pennsylvania, South   Carolina, New Mexico, and Central California. The primary objective of   the study was to identify individuals involved in disputes that might   have become lawsuits. The major area of investigation was claiming   behavior. The dataset also includes 54 households from the \"screened   experiment,\" whereby households known to have been involved in   lawsuits were contacted. Dem\nographic variables include the age, sex,   education, occupation, and union status of the chief wage earner. Also   included are the respondent's sex, race, and family income. Questions   were asked about consumer problems, problems with persons who owed the   respondent money, discrimination problems, debt problems,   property-related problems, mortgage-related problems, landlord-tenant   problems, problems with government benefits, and post-divorce problems.  The unit of analysis is the household."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"conflict resolution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"lawsuits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XII.
