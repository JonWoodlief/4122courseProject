This survey, fielded December 19-20,  1998, is a call-back of the December 13-15, 1998 (CBS NEWS/NEW YORK  TIMES MONTHLY POLL #1, DECEMBER 19\n98 [ICPSR 2672]), and December  13-17, 1998 (CBS NEWS/NEW YORK TIMES MONTHLY POLL #3, DECEMBER 1998  [ICPSR 2674]), cohorts. Respondents were asked to give their opinions  of President Bill Clinton, the United States Congress, Vice President  Al Gore, and the Republican and Democratic parties. Those queried were  also asked a series of questions about the December 18-19, 1998, House  of Representatives' debate and the December 19, 1998, vote to send two  articles of impeachment against Clinton to the Senate for a trial,  thus impeaching Clinton. Topics covered whether respondents watched  the debate or the vote on television, how important the impeachment  was to the nation, and whether Clinton should resign or complete his  term of office. Respondents who offered an opinion on impeachment that  differed from their answers to similar questions in a previous survey  were asked to explain what had influenced them. Their views were  sought on whether Clinton's actions were serious enough to warrant  impeachment, the impact that a Senate trial would have on the nation  and the economy, whether Clinton could still be an effective  president, whether the Republican party was in touch with what the  American public wanted, and how they reacted to Clinton's  post-impeachment speech delivered after the House vote on December 19,  1998. Background information on respondents includes age, race, sex,  education, religion, political party, political orientation, marital  status, voter registration and participation history, Hispanic descent, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gore, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"impeachment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
