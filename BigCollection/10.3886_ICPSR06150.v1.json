(2) This dataset has the same hierarchical   structure as the original 1-Percent PUMS. There is a separate record   type for each of the two levels in the hierarchy: the housing level is   represented by a housing record comprising 112 housing variables, the   person level by a person record comprising 123 person variables. (These   variable counts do not include the housing serial number, SERIALNO, and   the variable denoting the record type, RECTYPE. These two variables   appear on both the housing and person records.) Each occupied housing   unit is represented by a single housing record followed by one or more   person records, one for each person in the household. Housing records   representing vacant housing units are not followed by any person   records. Each person residing in group quarters is represented by a   housing record followed by a person record. In all, this dataset   contains 36,179 records: 11,074 housing records and 25,105 person   records. Every housing and person record has a logical record length of   231.
