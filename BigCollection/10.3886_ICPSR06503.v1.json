The data were linked to form a pooled   cross-section time-series, in which multiple observations for   individuals are linked together. There is one record for each   enumerated person in the sample from the population schedules, and each   slave and farm has its own record as well. Agricultural data in the   collection\nprovide information on a variety of topics, such as the   amount and dollar value of livestock, including cows, sheep, and pigs,   agricultural commodities, such as wheat, oats, and barley, and dairy   products like cheese and butter. Information about the value of   orchards, farm land, and equipment is also included. Part 1, the   agricultural census data for 1860, also provides information on the   number of slaves in households, giving the number of male and female   slaves in specific age groups (adults, teens, children, and babies).   The agricultural census data for 1870 in Part 2 supply additional   demographic variables, including U.S. citizen status, voting status,   parents' birthplaces, and whether the person could write. Part 3, the   agricultural census data for 1880, provides more in-depth information   on livestock, including the number of sheep and cattle that were sold,   slaughtered, born, or died. Other variables relate to the acreage of   crops planted in corn, rice, wheat, and barley. Demographic variables   common to all three agricultural censuses include age, sex, race,   occupation, birthplace, literacy, and number of males and females in   the household for all age groups (adults, teens, children, and babies).   The U.S. Census population manuscript data offer demographic   information similar to the demographic variables from the agricultural   census data, and also include whether the person attended school. In   addition, Part 6, Population Manuscript Data, 1870, covers citizen   status, voting status, parents' birthplaces, and whether the person was   deaf, dumb, blind, or insane. The 1880 population data in Part 7   provide variables for various health conditions: sick, blind, deaf,   idiocy, insanity, and whether the person was maimed. Parents'   birthplace and the person's relationship with the head of the household   and head of the family are also included. Part 4, Panel Data: Farms   Reported in Two or More Census Years, and Part 8, Panel Data: Household   Heads and Other Males Enumerated in Two or More Census Years, supply   data on farms and individuals who were enumerated in two or more census   years.
