In the immediate aftermath of war, peace is precarious, but in some cases it lasts and in others it fails. Why do some cease-fires fall apart within days or months, while others last for years, and still others last indefinitely? Why did a cease-fire reached in July 1948 during the first Arab-Israeli war fail after only three months? Why did the next last longer, yet ultimately fail? Why has the armistice in Korea held? Why did Honduras and El Salvador clash again seven years after the Football War, and how did they avoid full-scale hostilities? How did Ethiopia and Somalia manage to avert resumption of their 1978 war over the Ogaden? What would we need to know to predict whether the cease-fire reached in June 2000 between Ethiopia and Eritrea will hold? In short, what determines whether peace lasts? And perhaps more important, what, if anything, can the belligerents themselves or the international community do to improve the chances of durable peace? These are the questions that motivate this book."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Dissertation"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Page Fortna"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Replication"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Peace Time: Cease-Fire Agreements and the Durability of Peace.
