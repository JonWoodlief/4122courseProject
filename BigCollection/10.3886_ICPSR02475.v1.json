Of the 80 PSUs, 8 were selected with certainty and 72 were  selected with probability proportionate to size based on the size of  the 8th- (or 10th-) grade class in each school. In schools with more  than 400 8th (or 10th) graders, a random sample of students or classes  was drawn. In schools with less than 400 8th (or 10th) graders, all  students were asked to participate. Each sampled school was asked to  participate for two years, so that each year one-half of the sample is  replaced. Schools refusing participation were replaced with similar  schools in terms of geographic location, size, and type of school  (e.g., public, private/Catholic, private/non-Catholic). For the  8th-grade survey, schools with less than 15 8th graders were excluded  from the sample. For the 10th-grade survey, schools with less than 25  10th graders were excluded. The participation rate among\nschools has  been between 66 and 80 percent since the inception of the study.
