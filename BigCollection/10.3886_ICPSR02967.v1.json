Respondents were asked whether they intended to vote in the upcoming November 7, 2000, presidential election and for whom they would vote if the election were held that day, given a choice between Democratic candidates Vice President Al Gore or former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, and Republican candidates Texas governor George W. Bush or Arizona senator John McCain. Views were sought on which of the candidates could be described as understanding the problems of people such as the respondent, a strong leader, saying what he thinks even if it is not popular, capable of bringing needed change to Washington, DC, innovative, most knowledgeable on world affairs, running a positive campaign, has a chance of winning the election, and is best able to maintain a strong economy. Respondents were asked for whom they would vote in a Republican primary or caucus given a choice between Bush, McCain, and radio talk show host Alan Keyes, and for whom they would vote in a Democratic primary or caucus given a choice between Gore and Bradley. Additional questions addressed whether personal character or position on the issues was more important when choosing a president, whether the candidates had explained what they would do if elected, whether Bush would be able to keep the federal budget balanced and cut income taxes at the same time, whether the fact that Gore had served with President Clinton for eight years made respondents more or less likely to vote for him, and whether respondents intended to vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in the 2000 congressional election.
