Those queried were asked how closely they had followed the preparations for December 31, 1999, whether they had been excited about the event, and what they did on that evening that was different from their usual observance of New Year's Eve. A series of questions addressed concerns about Y2K computer problems, including how respondents were affected by Y2K bugs, whether they worried that problems would occur, what actions they took to prepare for such problems, and who deserved praise for the fact that there were very few Y2K computer problems reported. Respondents' views on terrorism against Americans were also elicited, with questions on whether respondents feared terrorist attacks on New Year's Eve and whether they changed their plans because of those concerns, whether the United States government responded appropriately to threats of terrorism, who deserved credit for the lack of terrorist acts related to New Year's Eve, whether acts of terrorism would increase in the next century, and what the government could do to reduce threats against Americans. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent, education, religion, marital status, political party, political orientation, age of children in household, family income, and computer and Internet access."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"communications systems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"twenty-first century"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
