The file consisted of 105  trend questions asked at least five times in standard Eurobarometer  surveys. A total of 1,134,384 respondents from 15 European Union  member nations (initially, six European Community nations) plus Norway  in some years were interviewed in these surveys. The cumulative trend  questions concentrated on the respondents' knowledge and opinions of  the European Community (EC)/European Union (EU). Respondents were  asked for their opinion regarding European unification and whether or  not they were satisfied with the speed of regional integration.  Respondents were also asked to describe their sentiments with respect  to citizenship and whether they identified themselves more as a  citizen of their home country or as a citizen of Europe. The surveys  also asked questions regarding EC/EU institutions such as the European  Parliament (EP), the European Commission, the European Court of  Justice, and the European Central Bank, among others. Respondents were  asked whether they had heard about EC/EU institutions, the importance  of these institutions, and whether or not they believed these  institutions to be trustworthy. The surveys addressed several other  issues of economy, society, and polity including the overall state of  the economy in the EU and its individual member states, the  respondents' overall satisfaction with their lives, whether certain  policy decisions should be made at the EU or national level, the  importance of European Parliamentary elections, recent voting  behavior, voter intentions, party preferences, whether respondents  discussed political matters, whether they attempted to persuade others  close to them to share their views on subjects they held strong  opinions about, and how they viewed the need for societal change.  Respondents were asked how closely they followed various news and by  which media they received the news, how much they supported different  types of political and social movements, and what they believed was  the probability of strikes and world war in the next ten years.  Demographic and other background information collected included the  respondents' age, gender, and marital status, the number of\npeople  residing in the household, the number of children under 15 in the  household, respondent's age at completion of education, left-right  political self-placement, occupation, religion, subjective social  class, political party affiliation, trade union membership, household income, region of residence, and subjective size of community."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"activism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizenship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"democracy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic

Sixteen Eurobarometer surveys (52.0-57.2) covering the time  period 1999-2002 were added to the trend file. The 100 trend questions  of the first\nedition (1970-1999) were continued if available during  this time period and included the documentation of variations in  question wording. Furthermore, two new trends (TRUST and CITIZEN),  that now meet the minimum frequency condition, were also added to the  trend file. Also new to the trend file was the tech variable, EDITION,  used to identify the dataset edition and version. The tech variable,  NATION, was divided into NATION1 and NATION2. NATION1 corresponded  exactly to the original variable, NATION, while NATION2 collapsed the  separate samples for Germany (East and West) and the United  Kingdom.
