In states with higher funding levels, a larger percentage of the substance-abusing population may be admitted to treatment, including the less severely impaired and the less economically disadvantaged.</p></li>\n<li><p>The primary, secondary, and tertiary substances of abuse reported to TEDS are those substances that led to the treatment episode, and not necessarily a complete enumeration of all drugs used at the time of admission.</p></li>\n<li><p>The way an admission is defined may vary from state to state such that the absolute number of admissions is not a valid measure for comparing states.</p></li>\n<li><p>States continually review the quality of their data processing. As systematic errors are identified, revisions may be enacted in historical TEDS data files. While this process improves the dataset over time, reported historical statistics may change slightly from year to year.</p></li>\n<li><p>States vary in the extent to which coercion plays a role in referral to treatment. This variation derives from criminal justice practices and differing concentrations of abuser subpopulations.</p></li>\n<li><p>Public funding constraints may direct states to selectively target special populations, for example, pregnant women or adolescents.</p></li>\n<li><p>TEDS consists of treatment admissions, and therefore may include multiple admissions for the same client. Thus, any statistics derived from the data will represent admissions, not clients. It is possible for clients to have multiple initial admissions within a state and even within providers that have multiple treatment sites within the state. TEDS provides a national snapshot of what is seen at admission to treatment, but is currently not designed to follow individual clients through a sequence of treatment episodes.</p></li>\n<li><p>TEDS distinguishes between \"transfer admissions\" and \"initial admissions.\" Transfer admissions include clients transferred for distinct services within an episode of treatment. Only initial admissions are included in the public-use file.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some states have no Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) that provide medication-assisted therapy using methadone and/or buprenorphine.</p></li>\n</ul>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>In 2012, a new variable was added that reports the number of times, if any, that a client was arrested in the 30 days preceding his or her admission into treatment. The variable is not on files prior to 2008.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>In 2012, changes were made to the full TEDS series. The changes consisted of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The recoding scheme of the variable DENTLF (Detailed Not in Labor Force Category) was changed. The cases for \"Inmate of Institution\" have been separated from \"Other\" and are now a standalone category.</p></li>\n<li><p>The recoding scheme of the variable DETCRIM (Detailed Criminal Justice Referral) was changed. The cases for \"Prison\" have been separated from \"Probation/Parole\" and are now a standalone category. The same was done for the cases for \"Diversionary Program\" which were previously combined with \"Other\". But the cases for \"Other Recognized Legal Entity\" previously combined with \"State/Federal Court, Other Court\" have now been combined with the \"Other\" category.</p></li>\n</ul>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>In 2011, a change was made to the full TEDS series. All records for which the age is missing are now excluded from the dataset.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>In 2010, changes were made to the full TEDS series. The changes consisted of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Clients 11 years old and younger are excluded from the dataset.</p></li>\n<li><p>Puerto Rico now has its own category for Census Region and Division. Clients in Puerto Rico were formerly classified into the South Census Region and South Atlantic Census Division.</p></li>\n<li><p>The state FIPS (STFIPS) variable is retained and a second state variable was dropped to reduce redundancy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Value labels and question text are better aligned with the TEDS State Instruction Manual for Admissions Data.\n<a href=\"http://wwwdasis.samhsa.gov/dasis2/manuals/teds_adm_manual.pdf\">http://wwwdasis.samhsa.gov/dasis2/manuals/teds_adm_manual.pdf</a></p></li>\n<li><p>The variable RACE is no longer recoded. Codes for \"Asian\" (code 13) and \"Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\" (code 23) are now retained. Previously these codes were combined into the single code \"Asian or Pacific Islander\" (code 3). Each state may report any of the three codes. Therefore, all three codes remain in the data, unchanged from the way they are collected by the states.</p></li>\n</ul>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The categories and codes in this public-use file differ somewhat from those used by SAMHSA and those found in the TEDS Crosswalks and in other reports. This is a result of the recoding that was performed to protect client privacy in creating the public-use file.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>To further protect respondent and provider privacy, all Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS) unique identification numbers have been removed from the public-use data. Therefore, no linkages are possible between the TEDS and the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) public-use files.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The data are collected from the states by Synectics for Management Decisions, Incorporated, on behalf of SAMHSA.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The 2005 public-use file was created using the most current data from October 2013 (the October 17, 2013 extract).</p>; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), rda Data file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2007-02-22"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["administrative records data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A) Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Administrative records from substance abuse treatment programs as reported to state substance abuse agencies."]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)"]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["treatment admissions"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["State laws require certain substance abuse treatment programs to report all of their admissions and discharges to the State.
