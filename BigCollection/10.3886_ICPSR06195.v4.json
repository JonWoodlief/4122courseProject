A special set of questions focused on issues facing European  societies, including family values and attitudes toward immigrants and  people in other countries.  Respondents were asked to rank their level  of interest in European politics, and to indicate their level of  support for the unification of Western Europe, including: (a) the  degree to which they found European unification personally important,  (b) whether they thought membership in the EC was a good thing, (c)  whether membership would benefit their country, and (d) how they would  feel if the EC were eliminated. They also rated how well they thought  demo\ncracy worked in the EC and in their own country. Awareness of  European institutions was measured by questions on how much  respondents knew about the European Parliament, the European Council,  the European Court, the European Commission, the Council of Ministers,  and others. Several questions concerned the presidency of the EC's  Council of Ministers, then held by Denmark. In addition, participants  were asked about their knowledge of and attitudes toward the  Maastricht Treaty on European Union and the proposed European Monetary  Union. This section of the questionnaire explored the Maastricht  Treaty's implications for national and EC control of drug traffic,  crime, defense, immigration, and a number of other areas of public  policy. With regard to defense policy, respondents were asked  specifically whether the EC should intervene militarily in the  conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Opinions were obtained on the  formation of a European Union with a European government responsible  to the European Parliament. The Single European Market, in operation  since January 1, 1993, was the topic of several questions, including  whether respondents regarded the Single Market with hope or fear, and  whether they had yet had any direct experience with the Single  Market. In anticipation of the first general election of a European  Parliament by the European Community's citizens in June 1994, the  survey assessed respondents' awareness of the European Parliament,  their overall impressions of its work, and opinions about its role in  policymaking. Participants' intentions to vote and reasons for not  voting in the upcoming election were also solicited. A special focus  of this Euro-Barometer was the family, its composition and personal  importance to respondents, and family values. The respective roles of  mother and father in various parenting tasks were explored. The trend  for grown children to stay at home longer was evaluated by respondents  as good or bad for the children and the parents. Respondents assessed  the priority for government policy on a number of family issues, such  as infant care leave, availability of child care, availability of  housing, and flexible working hours. Citizens' opinions of other  European peoples and countries were sought through questions asking  how much trust respondents placed in the people of various EC  countries (as well as the United States, Japan, and Russia), which  countries they favored becoming part of the European Community, and  which citizens of other countries ought to be able to work and reside  in the European Community. A number of questions concerned immigration  and its effects on the European Community. Opinions were also  solicited about Summer Time, a move to prolong daylight by putting  clocks forward one hour from the last Sunday in March to the last  Sunday in September. As in previous Euro-Barometers, questions on  political party preference asked respondents which party they felt  closest to, how they voted in their country's last general election,  and how they would vote if a general election were held the next  day. Additional information was gathered on life satisfaction, family  income, number of people residing in the home, size of locality, home  ownership, trade union membership, region of residence, occupation of  the head of household, and the respondent's age, sex, education,  religion, religiosity, subjective social class standing,  socio-professional status, languages spoken, access to and use of media, left-right political self-placement, and opinion leadership."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child
