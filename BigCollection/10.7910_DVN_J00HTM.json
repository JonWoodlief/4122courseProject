Thus, despite the benefits of cryptocurrency based digital payments systems, their adoption and diffusion within general payment platform domain are significantly hindered. Blockchain architecture is widely recognized as a promising mechanism to support the management of cryptocurrency related transactions. However, ensuring the security of digital payment transactions is a challenging task due to various security threats and existing prevention mechanisms that are either computationally expensive or domain dependent. Among many, the Man-in-the-Middle attack and Double Spending are identified as key security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the means of addressing the said security issues by proposing a feasible transaction verification methodology; targeting a common payment platform that integrates different vendor based digital currencies together. The currency miners and the user applications are identified as the core components that cooperate with transactions. Accordingly, a scenario based transaction verification model is designed by considering transaction patterns among miners and user applications. The bitcoin-similar concept of ‘trust network’ is adopted in verifying transactions via building a trusted network among currency miners in the payment platform using digital signatures along with SHA-256 hashing and RSA algorithm. In strengthening the verification level, an approach of acknowledgments is defined associated with a minimum required level of probability. Furthermore, a time constraint is set depending on the peer-to-peer network conditions for a particular transaction to get completed with proper verification.\r\n\r\nIt is explored the strength and feasibility of the proposed methodology in the perspective of transaction verification over man-in-the-middle attack using a probabilistic evaluation where the possibility of a transaction getting verified decreases proportionally when the trusted network of miners getting unhealthy. Also, the double spending prevention is evaluated using the implementation of a mobile-based digital wallet as the proof-of-concept.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management","Computer and Information Science"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-03-04"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Sri Lanka"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"4"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"3/2016"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"research article"}]}},"files":[{"label":"4.3.3 Transaction Verification Model for Peer to Peer Service Oriented Digital Currency Transactions Based on the Foundation.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":124518,"dataFile":{"id":3004620,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/J00HTM/6QRX4P","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/J00HTM/6QRX4P","filename":"4.3.3 Transaction Verification Model for Peer to Peer Service Oriented Digital Currency Transactions Based on the Foundation.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":2641257,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15a9adc18a0-01fc6fc74ad8","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"054d606ab02ea34be47a98b938a0138a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"054d606ab02ea34be47a98b938a0138a"}}}]}}}
