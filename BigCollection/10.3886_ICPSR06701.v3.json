Respondents were asked for their approval rating of President Bill Clinton, as well as their thoughts about the economy, foreign policy, abortion,\npossible welfare and Medicare cuts, and the budget deficit. Opinions were also solicited on Congress, Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, and various other presidential candidates and political leaders. The call-back portion of the survey took place after Colin Powell's November 8, 1995, announcement that he would not run for president. Questions focused on respondents' opinions of Colin Powell, whether Powell should have run for the Republican nomination and whether he would have won, whether it would make a difference to respondents if Powell endorsed a candidate for president, whether Powell's decision not to run was based more on personal or on political reasons, and whether most Americans would be willing to vote for a qualified African-American candidate for president. Background information on respondents to the first survey includes voter registration status, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, and race. Background information for call-back respondents consists of age within a given range."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
