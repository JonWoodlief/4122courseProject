Data was  gathered via a two-wave telephone panel survey of registered voters in  the state of Florida. Respondents were asked a wide variety of  political questions including feeling thermometer ratings for several  politicians and political groups such as President Clinton, Vice  President Al Gore, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the Republican Party,  and the Pro-Life Movement. They were asked to rate job performance  for President Clinton, Governor Bush, and the Congress among others.  Respondents were asked how they would vote in a presidential election  between Texas Governor George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore and  in a general election between Democrats and Republicans if one were  held that day. In addition, the survey included a series of questions  designed to measure general political knowledge, including how much of  a majority is required for the United States Senate and House of  Representatives to override a presidential veto and whose  responsibility it is to determine whether or not a law is  constitutional. Respondents were also asked how much they followed  government and public affairs in the news. The remaining questions  concerned the abortion issue. Respondents were first asked to rate  how positively they felt about a series of abortion policy statements  and were instructed to discard any negative feelings. Later in the  interview, respondents were read the same series of abortion policy  statements and were then asked to rate how negatively they felt about  the statements, while attempting to discard any positive feelings.  The statements included the assertions that a woman should be able to  obtain a legal abortion if she becomes pregnant as a result of rape  and that a woman should be able to obtain a legal abortion if she  wants one for any reason. Additional questions addressed premarital  sex, traditional family values, interpretation of the Bible, and  women's equality. Background information on respondents includes  level of education, information on religious beliefs and practices, ethnicity, marital and familial status, age, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ambivalence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, Jeb"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gore, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pro-life movement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social values"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.H.
