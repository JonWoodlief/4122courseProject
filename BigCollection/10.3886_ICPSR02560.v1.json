Variables focusing on the compatibility of  community-oriented policing and the accreditation standards include  sources of legitimacy/authorization, community input, community  reciprocity, geographic responsibility, and broadening of  functions. Variables on problem-oriented policing include level of  analysis, empirical analysis, collaboration with nonpolice agencies,  evaluation/assessment, and nature of the problem.

Whether these two major  developments, one primarily operational and the other mainly  administrative, are compatible or in conflict emerged as a serious  issue in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The spectacular rise in the  popularity of community policing in the middle 1990s has made this  question much more timely and important.
