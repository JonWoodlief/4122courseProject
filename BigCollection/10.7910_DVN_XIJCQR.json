Students will find both courses that cover fundamental aspects of leadership and social entrepreneurship and courses that shed light on fields and topics that are potentially useful to leaders and social entrepreneurs. For students interested in social entrepreneurship, we also recommend two other guides: \"Hauser Center Guide to Noprofit Courses at Harvard University an\nd Beyond,\" published online by the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at www.hks.harvard.edu/hauser/tour/courses/index.html and \"The Unofficial Handbook for Social Entrepreneurship at Harvard,\" a student publication, new this year, from Social Enterprise in Action (SEIA), a student group at the Kennedy School.\nThis year, for the first time, the Center offers students a leadership development framework (pages 5-8). The framework organizes leadership skills and capabilities in five key areas and categorizes HKS leadership courses within those areas. We have developed this framework with the support and guidance of the faculty who offer these courses, and we are indebted to them for their help in its development."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leadership, courses, harvard, tufts, mit, kennedy school, social entrepreneurship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leadership, courses, harvard, tufts, mit, kennedy school, social entrepreneurship"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"course guide"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"course guide"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Center for Public Leadership"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-09"},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-09"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-01-21"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-09"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-06"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Unites States of America"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Metro Boston"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Leadership Courses, prepared by the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard\r Kennedy School, provides students at HKS and the broader Harvard community with comprehensive information on courses in leadership and social entrepreneurship available in 2008-2009 at Harvard University’s graduate schools, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University.","label":"CPL course guide_2008-2009.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":67474,"categories":["Leadership Courses 2008-2009"],"dataFile":{"id":1412203,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"CPL course guide_2008-2009.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":2808920,"description":"Leadership Courses, prepared by the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard\r Kennedy School, provides students at HKS and the broader Harvard community with comprehensive information on courses in leadership and social entrepreneurship available in 2008-2009 at Harvard University’s graduate schools, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:39025","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"564c62b3f5a8e4d90299705199cc5227","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"564c62b3f5a8e4d90299705199cc5227"}}}]}}}
