For this study family was not limited to just include biological parents. Family could include foster parents, step-parents, boyfriends or girlfriends of a parent living with the child, grandparents, or other relatives who lived in the home and who helped take care of the child(ren). To be eligible families needed to have a child who was between the ages of 7 and 11. Another requirement was that participants needed to be able to read, speak, and understand English. Family members with severe mental disorders or who required salient treatment were excused from participation since it would be hard or inappropriate to include them.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>Minimal disclosure protections were required to protect the confidentiality of the da\nta files. On both the parent and child files two measures were enacted. The first was to de-identify the location of each site. The second was to collapse the race/ethnicity variable into fewer categories. Nothing else was done on the child file; however, on the parent file specific medications are asked about on question 15. These have been grouped together into one value.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>On both files there are instances where some demographic information, such as gender, may have changed across the four waves of data collection. In the case of the parent file this is alright due to the fact that the responder may have changed from one wave to the next. For example, a mother may have been the respondent in wave 1 but then in wave 2 the father completed the survey. However, for the child's file this should not be the case. The same child is represented across all four waves. If there is a discrepancy one of the entries is in error. This could be due to the fact some of the children were quite young during their participation.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>There is only one version of the questionnaire that parents were asked to complete. However, there are two versions of the child's questionnaire. As a general rule children who were 8 years old or younger completed the version shorter in length. But there is only one data file for children. The variable order in the file follows the longer version. Variable labels begin with the question number given in the older child's questionnaire. When a question was also asked on the younger child's questionnaire the variable label contains that question number in parentheses directly following the first question number. For the most part the question text found in the codebooks comes from the older child version of the questionniare. In some instances the younger child version contained additional text prefacing the questions that was included in the question text.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>For the child's file, the original file deposited contained system missing data for not applicable cases in the case where the child did not participate in that wave of the data collection or the younger child version of the questionnaire was used. These blank cases were recoded into specific missing values. Those cases where participation in the wave did not occur were recoded first followed by those who filled out the younger child questionnaire.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>The variable, UNQFAMCD, provides a unique family identification number. It is an ID variable available in both files to link the two data files together.</p>; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), rda Data file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DA010825"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-12-10"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1998-11"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2004-04"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2000-08"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2004-04"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"District of Columbia"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Maryland"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["individual"]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>This study utilized a convenience sample.
