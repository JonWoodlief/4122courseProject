The seeds were collected from a community plantation in Padang Tiji District. The growth parameters measured were seedling height, stem diameter, leaf area, fresh weight of seedlings, dry weight of seedlings, root length, root number, and root weight. Measurements were made at 30, 45, 60 and 75 days after planting. Analysis of variance and least significant difference tests were used to analyze the growth data. Results show that Glu variety had greater diameter growth, dry weight biomass, number of fine roots and leaves area then other varieties; supporting local beliefs and practice that Glu is a better rootstock."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Rahayu S, Roshetko JM, Mitras K and Sabaruddin . 2011.
