This 2006 study builds upon studies that targeted United States faculty members in 2000 and 2003, and complements a similar study of United States fac\nulty members that was conducted in 2006. Topics covered by this study include: the role of the library on the modern campus, impressions about electronic resources, digital institutional repositories, and the preservation of scholarly journals. This study was meant to develop a descriptive overview of librarians' attitudes, behaviors, perceptions, and priorities. It targeted collection development librarians at United States institutes of higher education, as well as some executive-level librarians at larger campuses (included to ensure an accurate reflection of high-level thinking in these types of schools). Respondents were asked questions such as \"Which of the following best describes how your repositories are maintained or managed?\" and \"How important is working with faculty to incorporate information resources into their lectures and curricula?\" Demographic information about institutional size was also gathered in this study.</p>\n\n<p>An overview of major findings may be found on the Ithaka Web site\n<a href=\"http://www.sr.ithaka.org/research-publications/us-library-survey-2006\">http://www.sr.ithaka.org/research-publications/us-library-survey-2006</a>\n.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic libraries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information management"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"library collections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"library services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
