At the time of this study's release, the ADAM program was operational in approximately 35 cities nationwide, providing national and local profiles of drug use within arrestee populations and the monitoring of drug use patterns. An extension and refinement of the previous Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program (see DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES 1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]), the ADAM program (see ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE MONITORING (ADAM) PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 1998 [ICPSR 2826], 1999 [ICPSR 2994], 2000 [ICPSR 3270], 2001 [ICPSR 3688], 2002 [ICPSR 3815], and 2003 [ICPSR 4020]) is the United States government's primary source of information on drug use among arrestees, and is one of the primary research tools on drug use, crime, and other social indicators. Quarterly interviews with arrestees selected using probability based sampling (for males) and convenience sampling (for females) were conducted in jails and detention facilities at each ADAM site. Urine samples were also collected and tested for a core panel of drugs that included cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, and opiates. Because the drug screen could not detect drugs beyond 72 hours after use, only arrestees who had been incarcerated 48 hours or fewer were eligible for participation. The ADAM interview provided demographic and descriptive data, including race, age, marital status, source of income, screens for substance abuse and dependency, treatment history, arrest and incarceration experiences, and participation in local drug markets. At the conclusion of the interview, respondents were asked to provide a urine specimen. For the current study, which served as the pilot study for the domestic violence addendum, when the ADAM process was completed, arrestees were asked to answer questions about domestic violence. The domestic violence addendum was administered as part of the ADAM data collection in Sacramento,\nCalifornia, in the third (Part 1) and fourth (Part 2) quarters of 1999. Questions used in the interview were developed using a modified Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus and Gelles, 1986)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1 (Third Quarter Data) and Part 2 (Fourth Quarter Data) both include demographic variables taken from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) data collection.

Variables from the domestic violence addendum include questions about the types and instances (ever and previous 12 months) of intimate partner physical abuse (e.g., scratching, pushing, throwing, biting, choking, punching, burning, hair-pulling, and threatening with a weapon) and sexual abuse.
