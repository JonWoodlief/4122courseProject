A videographer and two  observers accompanied the driver. The videographer videotaped both  sides of each block and the observers recorded characteristics of each  block face in observer logs. Trained NORC viewers then watched the  videotapes for 15,141 block faces and coded the data using a lengthier  coding sheet than the observer logs, consisting of 126 questions,  mostly precoded. All logs with the videotapes contained a sequential  ID number, the name of the street of the face block, the cross streets  that defined the face block street segments, the direction the vehicle  was heading, the time, and the odometer readings. These appeared at  the beginning and end of each face block. The ID number, the time, and  the odometer reading stated in the audio and written on the  observation log had to match for coding the face block. The data were  collected seven days per week, for 14 hours a day from June until  October in 1995. Intercoder reliability was conducted during the  training of the coders. Both observers independently coded 90 block  faces. The observations were compared and differences resolved. Coding  procedures were revised as needed. To check the quality of the data, a  random sample of 10 percent of all block faces coded were\nlater  recoded by new observers and the results compared with the original coding.

In forming the NCs, consideration was  given to the clusters being as ecologically meaningful as possible and  internally homogenous on key census indicators. The resulting units  contained about 8,000 people, large enough to approximate local  neighborhoods. Eighty of the 343 NCs were examined. To ensure that a  wide range of neighborhoods were used, the 343 neighborhoods were  stratified by three levels of SES and seven levels of racial and  ethnic composition. After selecting the NCs, the block face became the  unit of observation. After the 80 NCs were selected, the National  Opinion Research Center (NORC) prioritized block faces by selecting  random neighborhoods by stratum. Three neighborhoods were regarded as  a unit of work. The priority list was followed essentially in order,  although some areas were switched for logistical reasons or because  some neighborhoods, deemed more dangerous or traffic-dense, were moved  to Sunday morning taping slots. Of the 27,734 block faces identified,  the following information was gathered: (1) There were 22,418 block  faces that had complete observation logs and videotapes. (2) There  were 1,395 block faces that had incomplete observation logs and  complete videotapes. (3) There were 2 block faces that had incomplete  observation logs and no videotapes. (4) There was 1 block face that  had a complete observation log, but not videotape. (5) There were  3,918 block faces that did not exist. (These block faces were  determined not to be block faces once out in the neighborhood. For  example, new construction eliminated some block faces.) A random  subsample of 64 percent of the videotaped block faces were chosen to  be coded. In those NCs consisting of 150 or fewer block faces, all  block faces were coded. In the remai\nning block faces, sample sizes  were calculated to approximate a balanced design as closely as  possible in order to maximize statistical power for comparisons of  NCs. A total of 15,141 block faces were actually coded for an average  of 189 bock faces per NC. Thirty of the coded block faces had coding  records but no observation logs and were thus excluded when the coding records and observation log records were merged."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN)  Systematic Social Observation, 1995    ","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38347,"dataFile":{"id":2637006,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN)  Systematic Social Observation, 1995    ","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
