The NHEFS was jointly   initiated by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the   National Institute on Aging, and other components of the National   Institutes of Health and Public Health Service. The primary purpose of   the followup study is to investigate longitudinal relationships between   the extensive data on physiological, nutritional, behavioral, and\ndemographic characteristics collected during NHANES I and subsequent   morbidity or mortality from specific diseases and conditions. The   1982-1984 wave of data collection for NHEFS followed all medically   examined respondents who had been 25 to 74 years in 1971-1975. The 1986   NHEFS wave focused on older members of the NHANES I NHEFS cohorts,   those who had been 55-74 years of age at their baseline examinations in   1971-1975 and were not known to be deceased at the time of the   1982-1984 NHEFS. In the 1986 NHEFS, the surviving respondents were   65-89 years of age. Data were collected on changes in vital, health,   and functional status and use of health care services that had occurred   since the last contact, whether the contact was in 1982-1984 or   1971-1975. The vital and tracing status file documents efforts to trace   all subjects who had been 55 years of age and over at NHANES I (N =   5,677) and ascertain their vital status and demographic data. Further   data collection was aimed at the 3,980 subjects who were not known to   be deceased by 1982-1984. Thirty-minute telephone interviews were   conducted with either sample members (N = 2,558) or with proxies for   the incapacitated (N = 469) and deceased (N = 581) subjects. Questions   were asked on household composition, self-reports of   physician-diagnosed medical conditions (with detail on reports of   cancer, bone fractures, and non-hospital health facility stays), death   if applicable, functional limitations, use of health care facilities,   and interviewer observations about the respondent. Items on coronary   bypass surgery, pacemaker procedures, and community services   utilization were 1986 additions to the NHEFS questionnaire. For those   respondents who had not been interviewed in 1982-1984, questions were   included on smoking and alcohol use, vision and hearing, exercise and   weight, and pregnancy and menstrual history. Health care facility   records were abstracted to provide diagnostic and summary information   on single or multiple overnight stays in hospitals and nursing homes   for 2,021 subjects reporting such stays. Death certificate data,   including International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes   for multiple causes of death, were added for 661 decedents reported  since the 1982-1984 wave, for a total of 2,266 decedents."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cardiovascular disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hospitalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"malnutrition"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nutrition"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"older adults"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"populations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk factors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social indicators"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vital statistics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
