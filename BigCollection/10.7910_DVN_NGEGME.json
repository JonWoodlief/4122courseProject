These messages are tailored to each motherâ€™s gestational week. It is hypothesized that delivering these short advice messages to pregnant women can improve maternal and newborn health. The study utilizes factorial randomization to compare behavioral and health outcomes between four groups: two groups receiving different sets of short message interventions (i.e., good household prenatal practices and healthcare seeking), a group receiving both messaging interventions, and a control group. Randomization occurs at the individual level. The primary outcome is newborn health, measured by appropriateness of weight for gestational age. Secondary outcomes include severe neonatal and maternal morbidity as well as psychological and behavioral measures. This study aims to enroll 6,000 pregnant women who attend county maternal and child health centers for their prenatal visits.
