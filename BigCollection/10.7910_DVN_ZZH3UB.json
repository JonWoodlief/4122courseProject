The courses were offered to educators from the USA and abroad during the spring and fall of 2013. Though based on the same course, minor controlled variations were made to both MOOCs in terms of the course length, discussion prompts, and group size. The primary use of this dataset is to enable social network analyses (SNAs) of these communications. In particular, it allows modeling network mechanisms to better understand factors that facilitate or impede the exchange of information among educators, and includes relevant characteristics of the participants, such as their professional roles and their experience in education.
