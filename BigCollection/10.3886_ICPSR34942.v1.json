During July of 2012, links to a Web-based survey were sent to administrators of the state-funded prekindergarten initiatives covered in the National Institute for Early Education Research's (NIEER) 2011 State Preschool Yearbook. The research team also checked with other sources to determine whether any comparable new initiatives had been started since the 2010-2011 school year, or whether any initiatives were omitted in the previous report. All initiatives included in the current report meet the criteria outlined by NIEER, which defines state preschool education programs as initiatives that are funded and directed by the state to support group learning experiences for preschool-age children, usually ages three and four.</p>\n<p>Two new initiatives are covered in the 2012 report, Arizona's First Things First Prekindergarten Scholarship Program and Massachusett's Preschool Child Care Enrichment Quality (PSCCE) Add-On Initiative. The survey included yes or no questions, questions that asked state administrators to select which of several choices best described their program, and open-ended questions. Where data were already available in the 2011 State Preschool Yearbook the research team provided the answer from the previous report and asked the administrators to verify that the information was still accurate for the 2011-2012 program year.</p>\n<p>Total federal, state, and local expenditures on Kâ€“12 education in the 2010-2011 school year were calculated by NIEER based on data from the\n<em>National Education Association's report, Rankings and Estimates: Rankings of the States 2012 and Estimates of School Statistics 2013</em>\n. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Head Start Bureau of the United States Department of Health and Human Services were the sources of data on federal Head Start spending and enrollment.
