Major metropolitan areas considered to be “high visibility areas” at high risk of terrorism, namely Washington, D.C. (DC), New York (NY), and Los Angeles (LA), were sufficiently oversampled to allow comparisons with the rest of the continental U.S., which are considered to be at low risk of terrorism. The interviews were offered in English and Spanish, and a $20 incentive was offered to encourage participation in the study.  Interviews were completed with a total of 3,300 households (with an adult respondent over age 18) for a response rate of 35%.  The study attempted to answer these questions: • How prepared Americans are for a terrorist attack or other disaster; • Who is and who isn’t getting the message about getting prepared; • How we can improve our educational messages about preparedness; • What we can do to maximize the impact of education and information on behavior; and • How we can increase the engagement of the general public in preparing for disasters."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Community and Urban Studies"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: of the Archive), within the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (\"Data-PASS\") in accordance with the Data-PASS terms (the \"Terms\") of use (available from: http://www.icpsr.org/Data-PASS).

High visibility areas are high-profile areas with potential terrorist targets and, thus, can be considered at high risk for terrorism. The high-risk stratum included Washington, D.C. (including the District of Columbia, Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun, Montgomery, and Prince George’s counties), Los Angeles County, and New York City (including Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island). The low-risk stratum included the rest of the continental United States. The high-risk stratum was sufficiently oversampled to enable comparisons with the low-risk stratum. The sampling used random-digit-dialing (RDD). This was supplemented with random sampling from Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander surname lists in an attempt to obtain at least minimum sample sizes that would allow separate analyses by racial/ethnic group as well as between-group comparisons. The unweighted sample over-represents Washington, D.C., New York, and Los Angeles due to the sampling design but has a racial/ethnic distribution comparable to that of the U.S. census. In contrast, the distribution of the weighted sample across the four geographic strata is comparable to that of the U.S. Census. However, the weighted sample under-represents Hispanics and Asian American/Pacific Islanders because these two groups have to be down-weighted to offset their higher selection probability (i.e., RDD plus list-assisted sampling). Compared to the U.S. Census, the survey sample, unweighted or weighted, has more women, older adults, individuals who were born in the U.S., individuals with more education and income, and households with children."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Telephone interview"},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The unweighted sample over-represents Washington, D.C., New York, and Los Angeles due to the sampling design but has a racial/ethnic distribution comparable to that of the U.S. census.
