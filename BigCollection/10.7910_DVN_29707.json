It has also been asserted that differentials in respondents' willingness to guess, driven strongly by personality, can bias traditional knowledge measures. Using a multinomial probit item response model, I show that, contrary to previous claims that âdon't knowâ responses to political knowledge questions conceal a good deal of âhidden knowledge,â these responses are actually reflective of less knowledge, not only than correct responses, but also than incorrect answers. Furthermore, arguments that the meaning of âdon't knowâ responses varies strongly by respondent personality type are incorrect. In fact, these results hold for high- and low-trait respondents on each of the five most commonly used core personality measures."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Political Knowledge, Item Response Theory"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jessee, Stephen A. \"\"Don't Know\" Responses, Personality and the Measurement of Political Knowledge.\" Political Science Research and Methods.
