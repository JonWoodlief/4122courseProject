Those surveyed   fielded questions concerning the likelihood of voting for Bush, the   condition of the national economy, and whether they were currently   better off than they were four years ago. In addition, respondents were   asked to identify how money saved from defense spending should be used,   to comment on the most important problem the United States government   should spend tax dollars on, and to indicate their willingness to pay   more in taxes so that the government could increase spending on items   such as health care, education, and homelessness. Respondents were also   recruited to participate in an experimental survey on January 28 to   assess immediate viewer reaction to President Bush's State of the Union   address during a CBS News special following the speech. Those recruited   for th\nis survey were asked to call back after the president's message   and give their approval rating of Bush. They were also asked whether   Bush's proposed tax cut would help end the recession, whether the   speech influenced their confidence in Bush's ability to improve the   economy, whether they were better off than four years ago, whether they   were worried about losing their jobs, and whether they would be willing   to pay more taxes if the federal government paid everybody's health   care costs. Additional questions concerned Bush's understanding of the   problems of the middle class, Clinton's explanation about his personal   life, the media's exaggeration of poor economic conditions, where to   place the blame for the United States' economic problems, paying more   taxes to improve education, and the future for the next generation of   Americans. Background information on respondents includes sex, age,   race, education, family income, political orientation, party   preference, voter registration status, most recent presidential vote   choice, employment status, labor union membership, health insurance  status, and socioeconomic self-placement."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
