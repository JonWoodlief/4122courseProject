Using a randomized evaluation of a nongovernmental-organization-led CBD program in Ghana, we examine whether community-based development results in citizens’ empowerment to improve their socioeconomic well-being through these mechanisms. We find that the leadership training and experiences associated with community-based development translate into higher perceived quality of village leaders, but they simultaneously decrease contributions to collective projects outside the context of the community-based development program. In addition, although the process encourages more people to run for district-level office and results in more professional political representation, it does not increase aggregate levels of government investment in communities. Ultimately, we find that although the program led to changes in village-level and district-level leadership, it did not increase investment in public goods and did not improve socio-economic outcomes."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social

communities were invited to receive an epicenter. Within each of the study districts, the research team first determined the villages that were eligible for inclusion in the study. Villages had to have fewer than 2000 people and could not be on a main road. THP’s programming is targeted at groupings of villages, so the programming team then divided villages that met this criteria into geographically defined village groupings of approximately 10,000 people. Within each study district, between six and eight village groupings were defined, for a total of 97 village groupings across the 13 districts. Enough clusters were identified that the sample frame was twice the capacity of The Hunger Project for expansion. Finally, in each district, a public lottery was held to determine which village groupings would be invited to receive THP’s programming. These lotteries were conducted between September 2006 and September 2008, with 51 of the 97 village groupings invited to take-up the treatment. The lotteries were conducted by pulling names out of a hat in public, and so no stratification beyond the district level was possible.   \r\n\r\nAfter the lottery, the villages selected for treatment were invited to participate in THP’s VCA workshops with the understanding that these workshops were part of a process of developing leadership skills and community plans that were intended to culminate in the construction of an epicenter building. Due to capacity constraints, THP did not immediately begin engagement with all communities selected for treatment. It began engagement in some communities in 2008, in some communities in 2009, in some communities in 2010, and in some communities in 2011. The timing of engagement with different communities was not randomly determined.  \r\n\r\nNot all of the communities invited to take part in THP’s programming accepted the invitation. Only 28 of the 51 village groupings invited to take part actually began the THP process. All but three of these groupings successfully completed construction of the epicenter building, and four groupings built two epicenter buildings."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In-person interviews"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This is anonymized data.","label":"finalusingindices_anon.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":97398,"dataFile":{"id":2972334,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/C9ZCDX","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/C9ZCDX","filename":"finalusingindices_anon.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":11797392,"description":"This is anonymized data.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:159eb7667c7-6c139b039a6f","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:4B8AfWCSerKJpvHDaxct7A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e2e6672100b362a21fcc3d7ee078e499","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e2e6672100b362a21fcc3d7ee078e499"}}},{"description":"This ReadMe file contains basic information on the data, software compatibility, and the codebook.","label":"ReadMe with Codebook.docx","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":97398,"dataFile":{"id":2972336,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/GYZ7OQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/GYZ7OQ","filename":"ReadMe with Codebook.docx","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":37356,"description":"This ReadMe file contains basic information on the data, software compatibility, and the codebook.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:159eb766ecd-aa07eaa659a5","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"cd2fcfdb3459760e1bbae9a8d5696a47","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"cd2fcfdb3459760e1bbae9a8d5696a47"}}},{"description":"This folder contains the data and ReadMe files.","label":"The Hunger Project Dataverse Files.zip","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"The Hunger Project Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":97398,"dataFile":{"id":2972337,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/ZLX3WY","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/ZLX3WY","filename":"The Hunger Project Dataverse Files.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":2076655,"description":"This folder contains the data and ReadMe files.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:159eb768557-4014b0f9b899","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f49a7615c074416a69dd17a491c6097a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f49a7615c074416a69dd17a491c6097a"}}},{"description":"This is anonymized data.","label":"THPawareness_HH_anon.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":97398,"dataFile":{"id":2972335,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/TLYEE9","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JGLOZF/TLYEE9","filename":"THPawareness_HH_anon.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":613690,"description":"This is anonymized data.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:159eb766ccb-4c6ac0e0c70f","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:pBgveBjHGCbtdFCUViaKeg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2aac8ff7d79068eca7105b355411cc97","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2aac8ff7d79068eca7105b355411cc97"}}}]}}}
