The objectives of this  project were (1) to describe and compare existing advocacy services in  Ohio, (2) to compare victim advocacy typologies and identify key  variables in the delivery of services, (3) to develop a better  understanding of how victim advocacy services are defined and  delivered, and (4) to assess the effectiveness of those services. For  Part 1, Service Agencies Data, comprehensive information about 13  VAWA-funded programs providing direct services in urban Ohio was  gathered through a mailback questionnaire and phone interviews.  Detailed information was collected on organizational structure,  clients served, and agency services. Focus groups were also used to  collect data from clients (Parts 3-11) and staff (Parts 12-23) about  their definitions of advocacy, types of services needed by victims,  services provided to victims, and important outcomes for service  providers. Part 2, Police Officer Data, focused on police officers'  attitudes toward domestic violence and on evaluating service outcomes  in one particular agency. The agency selected was a prosecutor's  office that planned to improve services to victims by changing how the  police and prosecutors responded to domestic violence cases. The  prosecutor's office selected one police district as the site for  implementing the new program, which included training police officers  and placing a prosecutor in the district office to work directly with  the police on domestic violence cases. The evaluation of this program  was designed to assess the effectiveness of the police officers'  training and officers' increased access to information from the  prosecutor on the outcome of the case. Police officers from the  selected district were administered surveys. Also surveyed were  officers from another district that handled a similar number of  domestic violence cases and had a comparable number of officers  employed in the district. Variables in Part 1 include number of staff,  budget, funding sources, number and type of victims served, target  population, number of victims served speaking languages other than  English, number of juveniles and adults served, number of victims with  special needs served, collaboration with other organizations, benefits  of VAWA funding, and direct and referral services provided by the  agency. Variables in Part 2 cover police officers' views on whether it  was a waste of time to prosecute domestic violence cases, if these  cases were likely to result in a conviction, whether they felt  sympathetic toward the victim or blamed the victim, how the  prosecution should proceed with domestic violence cases, how the  prosecution and police worked together on such cases, whether domestic  violence was a private matter, and how they felt about the new program implemented under VAWA."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The focus of this research and evaluation  endeavor was on direct service programs in Ohio, particularly advocacy  services for female victims of violence, receiving funding through the  STOP (Services, Training, Officers, Prosecutors) formula grants under  the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994. It was undertaken as a  collaborative partnership between the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice  Services (OCJS) and the Ohio State University (OSU). The objectives of  this project were (1) to describe and compare existing advocacy  services in Ohio, (2) to compare victim advocacy typologies and  identify key variables in the delivery of services, (3) to develop a  better understanding of how victim advocacy services are defined and  delivered, and (4) to assess the effectiveness of those services.  There were two components to this evaluation: a study of victim  service agencies (Parts 1 and 3-23) and a survey of police officers  (Part 2), some of whom participated in a new victim services program  and others who did not. The descriptions of victim advocacy\nservices  focused on (a) the types of agencies providing services, (b) how those  programs defined advocacy, (c) how those definitions were reflected in  the services being delivered, and (d) what outcomes the funded  agencies hoped to achieve.

For this study, VAWA programs in urban centers were selected,  since they offered the largest number of clients and the richest  diversity of services. The number of agencies participating in the  evaluation was further restricted to agencies identified as providing  direct services to victims. When these two criteria were applied, 13  victim advocacy programs were identified to participate in the  evaluation. For Part 1, Service Agencies Data, a survey was mailed to  each of the 13 agencies to collect comprehensive information about  services provided for victims. Respondents could either mail or fax  their completed surveys to the investigators. Additionally, a few  telephone interviews were conducted due to time constraints. The  survey was designed to collect detailed information from each of the  projects based on OCJS and VAWA quarterly performance reports, and to  solicit more detailed information on organizational structure, clients  served, and agency services. Focus groups were also used to collect  data from clients (Parts 3-11) and staff (Parts 12-23) about  definitions of advocacy, type of services needed by victims, services  that are provided, and the outcomes that are important to service  providers. This qualitative approach allowed the researchers to  describe services from the perspectives of the recipients and the  providers and to compare their views on critical questions while still  being sensitive to the needs of the women who participated. Each of  the focus groups lasted one to one and a half hours and the  discussions were audio-taped for later transcription and analysis.  The number of participants in each group ranged from two to sixteen.  No demographic data were collected on the participants in an effort to  protect respondent confidentiality of the clients and staff. Site  codes were also omitted for the same reason. Part 2, Police Officer  Data, focused on police officers' attitudes toward domestic violence  and on evaluating service outcomes in one particular agency. The  agency selected was a prosecutor's office that aimed to improve  services to victims by changing how the police and prosecutors  responded to domestic violence cases. The prosecutor's office chose  one police district as the site for implementing the new program,  which included training police officers and placing a prosecutor in  the district office to work directly with the police on domestic  violence cases. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the police  training program, and police officers from the selected district were  administered the surveys. Also surveyed were officers from another  district who handled a similar number of domestic violence cases and  employed a comparable number of officers. The first 20 questions of  the survey were completed by all respondents in both districts and  addressed attitudes toward domestic violence cases. Five additional  questions were included on the version distributed to the selected  district to assess the officers' reactions to the procedural changes  that were implemented as part of the new approach to dealing with domestic violence."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables in Part 1 include number of staff,  budget, funding sources, number and types of victims served, target  population, number of victims served speaking languages other th\nan  English, number of juveniles and adults served, number of victims with  special needs served, collaboration with other organizations, benefits  of VAWA funding, and direct and referral services provided by the  agency.
