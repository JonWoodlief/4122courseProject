A \"Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation\" (SLAPP)  was defined as a lawsuit filed against citizens or groups exercising  the right to petition the government. Each case violated the First  Amendment right \"to petition the government for a redress of  grievances.\" The Petition Clause, as it is called, is a fundamental  civil right, guaranteeing and encouraging citizen involvement in all  aspects of American political decision-making and governance. The  collection includes information on the petition action, political  context, amount of award or settlement, specific damages requested (no  money vs. a specified amount), attorney status, amount of court costs,  attorney fees, interest, and number of individuals and organizations  involved in the suit. Also included are several sociodemographic  variables describing the parties to the litigation, such as marital  status, employment, occupation, county and state of residence,  political party orientation and membership, and interest group membership."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen grievances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"civil rights"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"First Amendment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"lawsuits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XII.
