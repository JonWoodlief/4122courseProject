Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, the economy, and foreign policy, as well as their views of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and Lewinsky's former Pentagon colleague Linda Tripp. Respondents' opinions were also sought on the investigation into an alleged affair between Clinton and Lewinsky, and in particular the subpoena of Clinton to testify before a grand jury. Topics covered the importance of this matter to the nation, whether this was a public or private matter, the cooperation of Clinton, the granting of immunity to Lewinsky in exchange for testimony, whether Lewinsky would be a credible witness, and media coverage of the situation. An additional question sought respondents' views on security at the United States Capit\nol in light of the July 24, 1998, shooting there. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, ethnicity, political party, political orientation, marital status, education, family income, and age of children in household."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
