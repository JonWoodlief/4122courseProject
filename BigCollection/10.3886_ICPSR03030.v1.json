Conducted not long after the 1996 Eurobarometer Survey  (EUROBAROMETER 46.1: MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY, PRIVACY ON COMPUTER  NETWORKS, AND THE COMMON EUROPEAN CURRENCY, OCTOBER-NOVEMBER 1996  [ICPSR 6940]), this study posed some questions similar to those asked  of European respondents. To begin the interview, respondents were  asked how interested they were in selected news issues, including  agriculture and farm events, economic and business conditions, new  scientific and medical discoveries, new inventions and technologies,  environmental pollution, and quality and cost of health care services,  and how well informed they felt about these issues. They were asked  how often they read a newspaper, what magazines and newsletters they  read regularly, and whether new technologies such as solar energy,  computers and information technology, biotechnology, genetic  engineering, telecommunications, and space exploration would improve  our way of life over the next 20 years. Respondents were also queried  on the meaning of the term \"modern biotechnology\" and asked if they  had heard or read anything about modern biotechnology in the last  three months, where they heard or read about it, what they had heard  or read, and how they would get more information on the subject if  they wanted it. They were asked if they knew about the cloning of Dolly  the sheep, whether they understood the terms \"DNA\" and \"molecule\", and  whether they knew about specific applications of biotechnology used  for food and drink production, plant and crop genetics for pest  resistance, human genetics for medicine and for organ transplant, and  detection of serious diseases in unborn children. Respondents were  also asked whether these applications were useful, risky, or morally  acceptable to society, whether the practices should be encouraged, and  how much trust they would have in groups such as the American Medical  Association, the Food and Drug Administration, university scientists,  food manufacturers, the National Institutes of Health, news reporters,  the United States Department of Agriculture, TIME or NEWSWEEK, and  CONSUMER REPORTS if these groups were to make public statements about  the safety of biotechnology. Agreement or disagreement was sought  regarding statements about topics such as informed citizens' influence  on government science and technology policies, federal funding of  knowledge-advancing scientific research, pain and injury to laboratory  animals for human benefit, current biotechnology regulations, personal  or family benefits from biotechnology, religion and biotechnology,  public involvement in biotechnology policies, and whether respondents  supported or opposed biotechnology and why. Respondents were read a  list of human attributes, including eye color, intelligence,  happiness, athletic ability, work attitude, and musical ability, and  asked if they thought each was inherited or learned. They were  further queried as to whether, in the next 20 years, modern  biotechnology would cause a reduction in environmental pollution, world  hunger, or the range of fruits and vegetables available, create new  diseases, cure most genetic diseases, improve Third World natural  resource yield, produce designer babies, or replace most existing food  products. Respondents were asked for their understanding of the term  \"scientific study\" and to determine the truth of a set of statements  having to do with bacteria, viruses, senility, cloning, the human  immune system, and animal, human, and plant genetics. In addition,  they were asked how important biotechnology issues were to them  personally, how informed they felt about biotechnology, and if they  had ever talked about this subject with someone prior to the  interview. Demographic attributes collected include political  participation (including whether\nthe respondent had written or spoken  to any public official during the past year, their party affiliation,  and who they voted for in 1996), religious affiliation and  participation, marital status, number of adults and children in the  household, educational attainment and field of study (including  specific science and math courses taken in high school and any current  studies), current employment status and occupation, computer usage at  work, pets, language spoken at home, computer ownership, World Wide  Web access and usage, smoking, geographic location, race, age, and gender."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"biotechnology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cloning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"genetic engineering"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"government regulation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"knowledge (awareness)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"scientific research"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"technology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
