However, it becomes difficult to complete projects in the allocated cost, time and quality. Taking this into consideration, cost, time, and quality and leadership performance problem is one of the major problems in Oromia industry and urban development Bureau building construction projects. Therefore, this research was carried out to investigate factors that affect cost, time, and quality and leadership style performance during construction projects under Oromia industry and urban development Bureau. Questionnaire surveys together with desk study were used to collect data on time and cost overrun. A total of 30 questionnaires from owner, consultants and contractors were collected and a desk study of 10 completed building construction projects in Oromia industry and urban development were investigated. From the results it was found that 100% of the building construction projects suffered both time and cost performance. The actual rate of cost performance ranges from a minimum of 12% to the maximum of 60% of the contract amount and the actual time performance ranges from a minimum of 7% to the maximum of 170% of the contract time.\r\nRespondents identified 13 factors affecting cost performance, 31 factors affecting time performance, 5 factors affecting quality performance and 3 factors affecting leadership performance for under Oromia industry and urban development Bureau building construction projects case. The extremely significant factors of affecting time performance were delay to furnish and deliver the site (Right of way problem), financial problems and improper planning. Whereas the extremely significant factors affecting cost performance were design changes, fluctuations in the cost of most significant factors affecting quality performance were construction project educated personnel, relevant work experienced personnel, quality of materials and equipment used in the project construction and conformance to specification. The most significant factors affecting the leadership performance were leader’s professional education, leader’s relevant work experience and training."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management","Engineering","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-12-22"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Ethiopia"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"4"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2/2016"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"dissertation"}]}},"files":[{"description":"ABC Research Alert, Volume 4, No 2/2016","label":"Factors Affecting the Performance of Construction Project under Oromia Industry and Urban Development Bureau, Ethiopia","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":96835,"dataFile":{"id":2966516,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/QH6Q5B/BDTBDM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QH6Q5B/BDTBDM","filename":"Factors Affecting the Performance of Construction Project under Oromia Industry and Urban Development Bureau, Ethiopia","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":925270,"description":"ABC Research Alert, Volume 4, No 2/2016","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:159264071b5-21653580f577","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e788a15b13db57e7596eb1ddbcdfd109","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e788a15b13db57e7596eb1ddbcdfd109"}}}]}}}
