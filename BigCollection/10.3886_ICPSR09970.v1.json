The IPS program was characterized by four changes in usual  procedures: (1) increased supervision, (2) risk/needs assessment for  substance abuse, employment, and marital/family relationships, (3)  stricter enforcement of probation, and (4) a four-stage revocation  procedure for technical violations. The investigators also studied  whether the additional caseload of the probation officers who  implemented the IPS program reduced the number of supervision contacts  with non-IPS probationers under normal minimum, moderate, and maximum  supervision regimens. Offenders put on IPS probation in 1985 from 13  experimental courts were compared to high-risk offenders put on  regular probation in the experimental courts in 1984, and to high-risk  offenders on regular probation from 13 control courts for both 1984  and 1985. Data were derived from risk assessment forms,  needs/strengths assessment forms, probation supervision records, and  criminal history data obtained from the state's probation central  field. For each offender, a full range of data were collected on (1)  offender risk characteristics at initial, four-month, ten-month, and  termination assessments, (2) offender needs characteristics at the  same intervals, (3) probation officer/offender contact chronologies  for the entire one-year follow-up period, and (4) offender prior criminal history and recidivism during a one-year follow-up period."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arrest records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"caseloads"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probationers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"property crimes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk assessment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
