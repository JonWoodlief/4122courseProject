Prior to the debate, registered voters were  asked about the chances that they would vote in the upcoming  presidential election, for whom they would vote if the election were  being held that day, an\nd whether they planned to watch the  vice-presidential debate. A subset of respondents agreed to  participate in a follow-up poll conducted immediately after the debate  between vice-presidential candidates Al Gore and Jack Kemp. These  respondents were asked whether they had watched any of the debate, who  they believed won the debate, and for whom they would vote in the  upcoming presidential election if the election were held that day.
