The SF3  data contain information compiled from the questions asked of a sample  of persons and housing units enumerated in Census 2000. Population  items include sex, age, race, Hispanic or Latino origin, household  relationship, marital status, caregiving by grandparents, language and  ability to speak English, ancestry, place of birth, citizenship status  and year of entry to the United States, migration, place of work,  journey to work, school enrollment, educational attainment, veteran  status, disability, employment status, industry, occupation, class of  worker, income, and poverty status. Housing items include housing unit  vacancy status, housing unit tenure (owner/renter), number of rooms,  number of bedrooms, year moved into unit, occupants per room, units in  structure, year structure built, heating fuel, telephone service,  plumbing and kitchen facilities, vehicles available, value of home,  rent, and shelter costs. The information in SF3 is presented in 813  tables, one variable per table cell, plus additional variables with  geographic information. However, only 409 of these tables are shown  for the block group and higher levels of geography. The remaining 404  tables, which are shown for the census tract and higher levels of  geography, were excluded from the block group subset. Cases in the  summary file data are classified by levels of observation, known as  \"summary levels\" in the Census Bureau's nomenclature. The block group  subset comprises all of the cases in the SF3 data for summary level  150. Five data files are provided with this collection.

For  the nation as a whole, every state, the District of Columbia, and  Puerto Rico, there is one column-delimited file that contains  geographic identifiers (the geographic header record file or \"Geo\"  file), plus 76 comma-delimited table files, each of which contains a  portion of the SF3 tables. For states, the District of Columbia, and  Puerto Rico, the variables in the Geo file and table files 1-18 and  56-62 are shown down to the block group level, but the variables in  table files 19-55 and 63-76 are only shown down to the census tract  level. Consequently, table files 19-55 and 63-76 have fewer records  than the Geo file and table files 1-18 and 56-62. In comparison, every  one of 77 national files has the same number of cases. (2) The block  group subset was produced one state at a time from the 4,004 state  files (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico). Initial  steps in the production of a subset for a state involved sorting its  Geo file and table files 1-18 and 56-62 in ascending order of the  common identification variable LOGRECNO, reformatting the Geo file as  a comma-delimited file, and stripping off the first five  identification variables from table files 1-18 and 56-62. Next, the  reformatted Geo file was merged with the stripped table files so that  corresponding records in the Geo and table files were joined as a  single record in the merged file. A state subset was generated by  extracting from the merged file all cases coded 150 for SUMLEV, the  variable that identifies the summary level. After subsets were  produced for every state, the national and regional subsets were  generated by combining their component state subsets in ascending  order of their state Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)  codes. (3) The following states are included in the regional files.  Northeast: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New  Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Midwest:  Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North  Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. South: Alabama,  Arkansas, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,  Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South  Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Puerto  Rico.\nWest: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho,  Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.  (4) The implied decimal places in variables INTPTLAT (latitude) and  INTPTLON (longitude) in the original data files were made explicit in  the subset files. Additionally, the values of all the Geo variables  were enclosed in quotes in the subsets, except for variables AREALAND,  AREAWATR, POP100, HU100, INTPTLAT, and INTPTLON. (5) The data  definition statements were tested with SAS 8, SPSS 10, and Stata/SE  8.

That information is contained in the data dictionary file  provided with this collection. (7) The codebook is provided by the  principal investigators as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.

The sampling unit for Census 2000 was the housing unit, including all  occupants. There were four different housing unit sampling rates:  1-in-8, 1-in-6, 1-in-4, and 1-in-2 (designed for an overall average of  about 1-in-6). The Census Bureau assigned these varying rates based on  pre-census occupied housing unit estimates of various geographic and  statistical entities, such as incorporated places and interim census  tracts. For people living in group quarters or enumerated at long-form  eligible service sites (shelters and soup kitchens), the sampling unit was the person and the sampling rate was 1-in-6."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"All Regions","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38071,"dataFile":{"id":2635304,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"All Regions","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Midwest Only","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38071,"dataFile":{"id":2635306,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Midwest Only","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Northeast Only","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38071,"dataFile":{"id":2635305,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Northeast Only","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"South Only","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38071,"dataFile":{"id":2635307,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"South Only","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"West Only","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38071,"dataFile":{"id":2635308,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"West Only","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
