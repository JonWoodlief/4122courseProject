The National Center for Education   Statistics (NCES) collects racial/ethnic enrollment data from higher   education institutions on a biennial basis. Some institutions do not   report this data, and their \"unknown\" categories have previously been   distributed in direct proportion to the \"knowns.\" This resulted in   lower than accurate figures for the racial/ethnic categories. With the   advent of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS),   NCES has attempted to eliminate this problem by distributing all   race/ethnicity unknown students. This is done in a two-stage process.   First, the differences between reported totals and racial/ethnic   details are allocated on a gender and institutional basis by   distributing the differences in direct proportion to reported   distributions. The second stage distribution is designed to eliminate   the remaining \"race/ethnicity\" unknowns. The procedure is to   accumulate the reported racial/ethnic total enrollments by state,   level, control, and gender, calculate the percentage distributions, and   apply these percentages to the reported total enrollments of   institutional respondents (in the same state, level, and control) that   did not supply race/ethnicity detail. In addition, the original \"race   unknown\" data were also left unaltered in order to provide data for   those who wish to review numbers actually distributed. The   racial/ethnic status was broken down into non-resident alien, Black   non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific   Islander, Hispanic, and White non-Hispanic. Variables include the   educational level of all male/female full-time and part-time students   enrolled in courses for credit at the institution. The unit of analysis  is the postsecondary institution."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gender"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school enrollments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
