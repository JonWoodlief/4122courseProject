This has resulted in several provocative claims regarding why the IOC selects particular cities to host the Olympics. Large-n analysis can dispel some of these assertions by identifying the systematic tendencies in the IOC's host city choices. After reviewing the selection process and the different influences on the IOC's choice of a host city, rank-ordered conditional logit estimation is applied to data proxies of bid candidate characteristics from 1959 through 2005. The IOC shows a statistical tendency to base its decision on the economic vitality of a bid city's home country and on the need to maintain continental diversity."}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Stata Dataset"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"poast_ii_2007_ioc_-_replication_packet_1.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68400,"dataFile":{"id":1542013,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"poast_ii_2007_ioc_-_replication_packet_1.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":5326,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:53963","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"0fd4675b5ca85ecd0c38a07d98dc8706","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"0fd4675b5ca85ecd0c38a07d98dc8706"}}}]}}}
