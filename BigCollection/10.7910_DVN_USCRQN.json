Few data exist to support measuring the language accessibility of government websites by persons with limited English proficiency (LEP). The Worldwide Web is asserted as the great leveler, bringing citizens into closer contact with their governments and the services those governments provide. This is certainly the case with English speakers. However for individuals with limited English proficiency, the web has left many behind. \r\n\r\nThe data is organized into two datasets: 1) cities and 2) counties.  The city dataset is comprised of the 100 largest U.S. cities for 2012 (http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/uscities_100.html).  Counties were sampled on two criteria: a) percentage of population that speaks Spanish or Spanish Creole at home and b) region.  To obtain a regional distribution of counties, those with the highest percentages of population that speaks Spanish or Spanish Creole at home were sampled within each of four Census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West.\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-27"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Spanish language, government website access, U.S. local and county"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Uebelherr, Joshua"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-12-09"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Codebook describes variables, sources, and method used to create the data-set.
