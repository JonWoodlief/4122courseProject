Topics related to health included smoking (e.g., how many packs smoked and how often, whether cigarette and tobacco advertising should be banned, and if the respondents were aware of the tar and nicotine contents of the brand of cigarettes they smoked), environmental risks (air quality, water quality, noise levels, quality of food, quality of lakes and rivers, exposure to the sun, and waste management), the communication of information regarding health risks and health behaviors, respondents' general health, emotional well-being (if ever happy, sad, calm, peaceful, tense, down-hearted, energetic, or tired), physical activities (like aerobics, digging, cycling, and housework) and the amount of time spent doing various physical activities, blood donation, organ donation, and HIV and AIDS. Questions pertaining to developing countries included the importance of helping people in impoverished countries, providing aid to those countries, how much of the nation's and the European Commission's budget should be spent on aid to other countries, which countries they felt were in the best position to help developing countries, and if the respondent was aware of the Cotonou Agreement (a partnership agreement between the European Union and all its member countries and the countries from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific), or had ever heard about the Lome Convention. Demographic variables include marital status, gender, age, current occupation, whether the respondent lived in a rural area or village, small or middle sized town, or a large town, household income, who contributed largely to the household income and the occupation of that individual, and how much toward the left or right the respondent placed their political views."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"developing nations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Parliament"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
