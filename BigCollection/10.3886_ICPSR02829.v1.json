Respondents answered questions about their practice arrangements, such as the number of different medical practices that they worked in during the past month, the number of hours spent providing patient care, and the number of patients seen in the past week. They also described the characteristics of their main practice in terms of type of practice setting, practice ownership, number of physicians, percentage of revenues from patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare, share of Medicaid and Medicare revenues from managed care organizations, percentage of patients with no health insurance coverage, and percentage of Black and Hispanic patients. Other information covered whether the practice had a formal mechanism for reviewing clinical practice decisions, whether it had contracted to provide care through a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), or Independent Practice Arrangement (IPA), whether it was joined with one or more physician practices or was purchased by an insurance company in the past two years, percentage of revenues from PPO, HMO, and IPA arrangements, and whether there were personal financial incentives that favored reducing or expanding services to patients. Additionally, respondents were asked whether contracts or other communications received from insurance plans implied that continued participation in the plans depended upon costs associated with their clinical decisions, or implied that they should not tell patients about restrictions on coverage for medically accepted testing, treatment, or referral options. Other questions probed respondents' career satisfaction, ethical beliefs regarding the practice of medicine, and freedom to practice medicine as they saw fit. The survey also gathered information on determinants of physician compensation, medical specialty, income, marital status, spouse's occupation, and the number of children living with the respondent."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health Maintenance Organizations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicaid"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Medicare"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"patient care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physician practice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physicians"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"professional ethics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA I.
