Specifically, the study  investigates whether two different types of self-report surveys  produce different estimates of lambda, an individual's frequency of  criminal offending. The surveys, which were administered during  personal interviews with inmates in Nebraska prisons, differed in how  respondents were asked about their frequency of criminal offending.  The more detailed survey asked respondents to indicate their offenses  on a month-by-month basis for the reporting period. The less detailed  survey only asked respondents to indicate their offending for the  entire reporting period. These data also provide information on the  relationship between race and offending frequencies, the rates of  offending over time and by crime category, and the individual's  subjective probability of punishment and offending frequency. The  specific crimes targeted in this collection include burglary, business  robbery, personal robbery, assault, theft, forgery, fraud, drug  dealing, and rape. All respondents were asked questions on criminal  history, substance abuse, attitudes about crime and the judicial  system, predictions of future criminal behavior, and demographic information, including age, race, education, and marital status."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In the late 1970s the RAND Corporation conducted  a survey of inmates, which became known as the RAND Second Inmate  Survey (SURVEY OF JAIL AND PRISON INMATES, 1978: CALIFORNIA, MICHIGAN,  TEXAS [ICPSR 8169]), to estimate lambda, an individual's frequency of  offending. The current study is essentially a replication of the RAND  study, with certain modifications, and was designed to address  criticisms of the original work and to provide more detailed  information on rates of criminal offending. The principal  investigators gathered data to address a number of issues. First, they  wanted to determine if lambda, calculated from responses to a modified  survey, differs from lambda determined by the RAND method. The  modified survey differs from the RAND survey in that it contains more  detailed calendars for reporting periods of criminal activity. The  more detailed calendars are believed to provide better cues for  recalling past criminal activity. Also, the RAND data were collected  through self-administered questionnaires. The current data were  collected through personal interviews with prisoners. Personal  interviews were conducted to reduce the amount of missing and  ambiguous responses found in self-administered surveys. A criticism of  the RAND study is that missing and ambiguous responses may have led to  inflated values of lambda. Next, the investigators explored whether  the RAND study's results regarding race and individual offending  frequencies could be replicated. Whether rates of criminal activity  vary over time and by crime category were also studied. In addition,  the investigators gathered data to investigate t\nhe relationship  between an individual's subjective probability of punishment and the  frequency of offending. The results of the research should be useful in developing crime intervention strategies."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A central purpose of the study was to compare  lambda determined by the RAND study with lambda determined by the  investigators' method. Seven hundred male prisoners in Nebraska were  randomly assigned to either a control group or an experimental group.  The control group was interviewed using the RAND method. The  experimental group was interviewed using the investigators' more  detailed month-by-month reporting method. Each interviewing method  required determining the respondent's \"street months.\" Under the  RAND method, respondents were shown a 24-month calendar. Only the time  period prior to their arrest for their current conviction was  relevant. The interviewer crossed off any months during which the  respondent had been incarcerated in that time period. The remaining  months were the street months, the time available to commit  crimes. The same procedure was used for the experimental group, except  that a 36-month calendar was used. This was done so that a longer  period of time was available to study variability in offending  rates. For comparison of lambda based on the two methods, lambda of  the experimental group was based on the 24-month calendar. Under each  interviewing method, respondents were asked if they had committed any  of certain target offenses (burglary, business robbery, personal  robbery, assault, theft, auto theft, forgery, fraud, drug dealing, and  rape) during their street months. With the RAND method, respondents  were asked how often they had committed each target crime during the  total street months. Under the experimental method, respondents  indicated the specific months during which they committed the target  offenses and their frequency of offending by month. In order to have a  larger sample with detailed information, those in the control group  were also given a supplemental survey after completing their original  survey. The supplement asked the frequency of offense questions using  the month-by-month method of the experimental group. The monthly data are available for 658 of the 700 inmates interviewed."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Topics covered in the interviews include criminal  history, substance abuse, attitudes about crime and the judicial  system, predictions of future criminal behavior, and demographic information."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime reporting"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"felons"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prison inmates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"recidivism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
