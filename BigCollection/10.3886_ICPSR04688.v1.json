One of the major  purposes of this study was to explore the value of creating an index  of entrepreneurial activity to complement existing measures that track  the status of all national economies. It is designed to provide an  overview of the extent of activity, the types of individuals who get  involved, the nature of the businesses that are created, and the major  sources\nof differences in entrepreneurial activity: personal,  regional, or temporal. It is the direct measurement of citizen  participation in the creation of new firms. Respondents were asked for  their opinions and experiences in creating new businesses, firms'  ownership and type, expectation for the new firm, and personal  investment. Other items addressed the firms' products, markets and  customers, financial situations, management and organizational  structures, and locations. These topics were assessed for the  individual company both in terms of initial status and current  status. Background information includes respondent's age, gender,  marital status, race, household income, occupation, employment status, education, household composition, place to use the Internet."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"business ownership"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"businesses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"entrepreneurs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"market economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"startup companies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
