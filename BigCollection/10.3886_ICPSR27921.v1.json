PROBER was the case-management system used by the probation offices in Hawaii (and in many other probation offices around the country) and included detailed records on probationer-supervision episodes, drug-test results, offenses, motions, and many other probationer interactions with the criminal-justice system. CJIS included comprehensive criminal-record data.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure accuracy of data collection from the administrative data sources, a data supervisor from the research team was assigned to oversee quality control. Two data-consistency checks were implemented: (1) A random sample of probationer hard copy files was compared with PROBER to ensure that PROBER records were comprehensive, and (2) the records of captured data were double checked (by a separate coder also from the research team) against PROBER. Very few discrepancies were detected, but, when found, were corrected.</p>\n\n<p>Missed Appointments Data (Part 1) were collected from 2007 to 2009 on a total of 1,174 probationers including 1,078 HOPE probationers, 78 comparison probationers, and 18 probationers for which study group information was not available.

Drug-testing protocols were quite different for HOPE probationers compared with those assigned to the comparison group. Comparison-group probationers were not randomly tested. Rather, testing was conducted on dates scheduled in advance, during routine office visits. HOPE probationers were subject to routine testing, but were also tested randomly (six times per month during their first two months and less frequently thereafter based on performance). Drug Test Results Data (Part 2) were collected from 2007 to 2009 on the same 1,174 probationers.
