This is consistent with the goals of South Africa’s government to strengthen the domestic capacity to undertake research on population and its relation to the development process. (b) To undertake field surveys that will provide both direct research experience for individual trainees and information on migration patterns and their causes and consequences. It is hoped that such information will allow better insights on migration as a process. In so, doing, it should provide a stronger basis for policy development and evaluation on the interrelations among population redistribution development, women’s status, health, and reproduction. (c) To create the opportunity for comparative assessment of migration patterns and policies in the four countries in the UNFPA/Mellon Foundation project, in order to enhance our understanding of migration in these countries in particular and in developing countries generally. Demographic variables include: Age, gender, level of education, marital status, migration, use of health services, economic activity, unemployment, employment and self-employment."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2003"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Indicators - International"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Africa - South Africa"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: of the Archive), within the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (\"Data-PASS\") in accordance with the Data-PASS terms (the \"Terms\") of use (available from: http://www.icpsr.org/Data-PASS).
