There were three components to the intervention: (1) an educational program delivered through home visits (weekly during the first year and every other week during the second and third years of life), (2) a daily center-based program beginning at 12 months corrected for duration of gestation, and (3) parent support groups coinciding with the start of the center-based program. Previously, the subjects were assessed at baseline up to age 3 (Phase I), age 5 (Phase II), and age 8 (Phase III). Phase IV assessed them at age 18.</p>\n\n<p>This data collection contains selected variables from all four phases that were used in analyses reported in two articles by the principal investigators and others:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>McCormick, Marie C., Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, Stephen L.
