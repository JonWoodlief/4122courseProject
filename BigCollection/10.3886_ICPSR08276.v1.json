After being classified according to the Wisconsin   risk and needs assessment scale, individuals who had been sentenced to   probation between January 2, 1980 and June 30, 1981 and had reported to   the probation department for intake were randomly assigned to one of   eight experimental and control groups. The experiment was limited to   adult residents of Milwaukee County who were not already on probation,   were not judged to be severe psychotic or severe sex-deviant cases, and   were not assigned to jail work-release sentences of more than ten days   followed by probation (Huber cases). There are three files in this data   collection: the Reassessment file, the Admissions/Terminations file,   and the Chronological file. Each case in the Reassessment and   Admissions/Terminations files represents data on an individual   probationer. There are 84 variables for 1343 cases in the Reassessment   file and 218 variables for 1922 cases in the Admissions/Terminations   file, both files have logical record lengths of 100 characters. Of the   1922 cases for which admissions data were collected (about 133   variables), 397 cases also have termination data available (an   additional 85 variables). Cases in the Chronological file are records   of probation agent contacts with probationers over the course of the   study. There are 17 variables for 47,169 cases (contacts) in this file   which includes information on 1781 probationers. As many as 270   contacts with a single probationer are recorded. This file has a  logical record length of 80."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probationers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
