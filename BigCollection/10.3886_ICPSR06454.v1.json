Respondents were queried about their current health   insurance status, reasons for not having health insurance currently,   out-of-pocket costs for current insurance, deductibles, and   co-payments. In addition, they were questioned about reasons why they   were denied health insurance, steps taken to obtain health insurance   after denial, acceptance of health coverage with a limit\nation rider,   and awareness of and enrollment in the Minnesota Comprehensive Health   Association, a state-wide high-risk insurance pool. Other questions   asked about respondents' health, limitations due to poor health, the   amount of time spent worrying about health insurance or health care   costs, familial conflicts caused by these worries, sacrifices incurred   in education, vacations, and major purchases due to concerns about   health insurance and health care, out-of-pocket costs for health care,   the amount of unpaid medical bills, and delays in seeking medical care   due to lack of money or insurance.
