The census included the following types of state and  federal adult correctional facilities: prisons, prison farms,  reception, diagnostic and classification centers, road camps, forestry  and conservation camps, youthful offender facilities (except in  California), vocational training facilities, drug and alcohol  treatment facilities, and state-operated local detention facilities in  Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and  Vermont. Facilities were included in the census if they: (1) were  staffed with federal, state, local, or private employees, (2) housed  primarily state or federal prisoners, (3) were physically,  functionally, and administratively separate from other facilities, and  (4) were in operation on June 30, 1995. The census also included 110  private facilities under exclusive contract to state governments and  the Federal Bureau of Prisons to house prisoners. In addition, the  census included 16 facilities under joint authority, including those  owned and staffed by state employees providing services to multiple  counties for a fee, facilities co-owned by the state and counties that  shared in their operation, and facilities staffed by county employees  who were state-certified for correctional administration.  Specifically excluded from the census were: (1) privately operated  facilities that were not exclusively for state or federal inmates, (2)  military facilities, (3) Immigration and Naturalization Service  facilities, (4) Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities, (5) facilities  operated and administered by local governments, including those  housing state prisoners, (6) facilities operated by the U.S. Marshals  Service, and (7) hospital wings and wards reserved for state prisoners."]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were collected from 125 federally-authorized prisons and 1,375 state-authorized facilities operating on June 30, 1995."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Created online analysis version with question text."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities, 1995      ","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":36330,"dataFile":{"id":2619357,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities, 1995      ","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
