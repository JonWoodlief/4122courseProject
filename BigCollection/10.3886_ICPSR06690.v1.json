Mothers of recently-delivered babies were queried at the hospital on   the source of their prenatal care insurance coverage and on their   delivery insurance coverage. Delivery insurance information was also   gathered from the respondent's hospital chart. These data were matched   to insurance coverage information from the state's birth certificate   database, linked to each respondent. This information covers principal   source of payment for prenatal care and expected principal source of   payment for delivery. Demographic information supplied in this   collection includes the mother's education, age, race, whether this was   the mother's first baby, whether the mother was foreign-born, and the  month prenatal care began."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA II.

Nineteen hospitals were   initially chosen to represent a geographically and socioeconomically   representative sample of California's delivery population. Women were   eligible for inclusion in the study if they met the following criteria:   (1) they had recently delivered a live-born infant at a study hospital,   (2) they spoke English or Spanish, (3) they were over the age of 17 (or   were an emancipated minor if under age 17), (4) they were   nonincarcerated during pregnancy, (5) charge nurse approval was   obtained, and (6) informed consent was obtained. Overall, 10,132 women   were interviewed. The survey data were then matched to birth   certificate data using information such as mother's name and baby's   birth weight. Cases that did not produce a significant match were   excluded. Data from 3 of the 19 hospitals were dropped due to low (less   than 95 percent) linkage rates. The final sample contains data from   7,429 women, successfully linked, out of 7,633 available survey records  for 16 hospitals."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Validating Insurance Information on the California Birth Certificate A Tool for Monitoring Financial Access to Maternity Care, 1994-1995","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":39180,"dataFile":{"id":2643744,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Validating Insurance Information on the California Birth Certificate A Tool for Monitoring Financial Access to Maternity Care, 1994-1995","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
