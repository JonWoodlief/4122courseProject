A national sample of 1,259 adults was surveyed, including an oversample of Gulf Coast residents. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way that Barack Obama was handling his job as president, the economy, and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, whether they approved of the way Congress was handling its job, whether they thought the country was headed in the right direction, and what they thought was the most important problem facing the country. Respondents were queried on how they would rate the condition of the national economy, whether they thought Obama had strong qualities of leadership, whether they though he had a strong plan for creating jobs, developing new sources of energy, and dealing with the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and how much confidence they had in Obama's ability to handle a crisis. Respondents were also asked how much they thought Obama cared about the needs and problems of people whose lives had been directly affected by the oil spill, whether they favored allowing increased drilling for oil and natural gas off the United States coast, whether they thought the United States was too dependent on other countries for its supply of oil, their views on government regulation of oil companies, whether they would favor increased taxes on gasoline if it could help pay for the development of renewable sources of energy, and how likely they thought that in the next 25 years the United States would develop an alternative to oil. Respondents were queried on how much they trusted oil companies to act in the best interest of the public, whether they approved of the way BP was handling the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, how much control they thought the Obama Administration had over whether BP would pay for the damages caused by the oil spill, how confident they were that BP would fairly compensate those affected by the oil spill, how much they blamed weak federal regulations on offshore drilling for the oil spill in the Gulf, how long they thought it would take BP to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf, and why they thought it was taking so long to stop. Respondents were also asked who they thought was mostly to blame for the oil spill, who they trusted more to handle the clean-up of the oil spill, BP or the federal government, whether they thought that BP was doing all it reasonably could do\nto clean up the oil spill, whether they though that members of the Obama Administration and BP were telling the truth about the oil spill, whether they thought that the wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico could recover from the oil spill, and whether they thought that the economy in the Gulf coast could recover from the oil spill. Information was collected on whether respondents thought that the moratorium on offshore drilling was a good idea, whether they themselves or a member of their family was directly or indirectly affected by the oil spill, whether they were directly affected by Hurricane Katrina, whether they would be less likely to buy gasoline from a BP station as a result of the oil spill, whether they had to change their vacation plans due to the oil spill, and whether they or someone in their household worked in the oil or fishing industry. Finally, respondents were asked if they watched or listened to President Obama's speech about the oil spill, how they would rate their household's financial situation, and how concerned they were that they or someone else in the household might lose their job in the next 12 months. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, marital status, education level, household income, employment status, religious preference, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration status, and whether respondents thought of themselves as born again Christians."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"energy
