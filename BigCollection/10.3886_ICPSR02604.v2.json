Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handli\nng of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy, as well as their opinions of Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Clinton. In light of the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, those queried were asked what they believed the bombings meant for the future of terrorist attacks, and whether they believed that the United States government could do anything to reduce terrorist attacks against American citizens. A series of questions addressed the claims that President Clinton had an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and then encouraged her to lie about the relationship under oath. Topics covered the importance of the allegations to the nation, what aspect of the allegations was most bothersome, who was to blame for the current situation, whether this was a public or private matter, and whether lying was ever justified. Respondents were asked whether they thought it was necessary for Clinton to make a public statement following his upcoming August 17, 1998, testimony before the grand jury, how they thought Clinton should be punished if he did obstruct justice, and how these claims had damaged the institution of the United States presidency. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, ethnicity, political party, political orientation, religion, education, marital status, voter registration and participation history, and age of children in household."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Hillary"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gore, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lewinsky scandal"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist attacks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
