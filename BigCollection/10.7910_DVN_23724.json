The sampling frame for the April 2006 survey was based on an existing list of hotspots compiled by PSI/Avahan implementing partners. Stratified two-stage cluster sampling surveys were conducted with hotspots defined as the primary sampling units (PSUs). States were regarded as strata, although Maharashtra was divided into two strata: Mumbai (due to its size) and the rest of the state. Baseline (April 2006) survey was conducted for programme evaluation purposes. The target sample sizes for baseline was 2400 individuals per round (480 per strata); the target sample size for monitoring was 1800 per round (360 per strata). The samples also allowed for comparisons across time within strata (calculating a 15% change in main behavioural indicator over time); significance level (alpha) was set at 0.05 and power (beta) at 80%."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured Questionnaire"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Tools for ABTS-1/OTS-1 (Baseline: BCIS) 2005-2006,  (By PSI)","label":"ABTS1-2005-2006 BCIS_Baseline -STI_Tools.rar","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131346,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2450292,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/23724/9FMDSG","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/23724/9FMDSG","filename":"ABTS1-2005-2006 BCIS_Baseline -STI_Tools.rar","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":4455024,"description":"Tools for ABTS-1/OTS-1 (Baseline: BCIS) 2005-2006,  (By PSI)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168529","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"66250309cc11e39b323d54823dd69e73","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"66250309cc11e39b323d54823dd69e73"}}},{"description":"ABTS/OTS Merged data set (By PSI)","label":"PSI_ABTS_merged data set.rar","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131346,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2451145,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/23724/TYPK7M","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/23724/TYPK7M","filename":"PSI_ABTS_merged data set.rar","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":1893996,"description":"ABTS/OTS Merged data set (By PSI)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:169507","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f63a96eb677a1a224d9d255a92deec89","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f63a96eb677a1a224d9d255a92deec89"}}}]}}}
