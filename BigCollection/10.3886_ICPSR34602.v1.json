A birth cohort of 800 children in three rural counties of North Carolina and 600 children in three rural counties of Pennsylvania were studied over the first 3 years of life.

Using both the Family Process Model of development and the Family Investment Model of development, observed parenting was examined over time in relation to child functioning at 36 months. Different aspects of observed parenting were examined as mediators/moderators of risk in predicting child outcomes. Results suggested that cumulative risk was important in predicting all three major domains of child outcomes and that positive and negative parenting and maternal language complexity were mediators of these relations. Maternal positive parenting was found to be a buffer for the most risky families in predicting behavioral competence. In a final model using both family process and investment measures, there was evidence of mediation but with little evidence of the specificity of parenting for particular outcomes. Results demonstrate the importance of cumulative risk and parenting in understanding child competence in rural poverty and the implications for possible intervention strategies that might be effective in maximizing the early d\nevelopment of these children.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>About 20 percent of children in the United States have been reported to live in rural communities, with child poverty rates higher and geographic isolation from resources greater than in urban communities. There have been surprisingly few studies of children living in rural communities, especially poor rural communities. The Family Life Project helped fill this gap by using an epidemiological design to recruit and study a representative sample of every baby born to a mother who resided in one of six poor rural counties over a one year period, oversampling for mothers living in poverty and African American mothers. 1,292 children were followed from birth to 36 months of age.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>All families living in the six target counties who have given birth to a child during the recruitment period (1 year) were eligible to participate in the project. Mothers were screened in the hospital and selected according to their income status in Pennsylvania and race/income status in North Carolina.</p>\n\n<p>Data collection consisted of a series of home visits, child care visits, and phone calls. Families were visited when the infant was 2, 6, 15, 24, and 36 months of age. The 2- and 15-month assessments consisted of a single home visit that involved the primary caregiver and the target child. If available and willing, the secondary caregiver was also included at the 15-month assessment. The 6-, 24-, and 36-month assessments consisted of two separate home visits that involved the primary (and, when possible, the secondary) caregiver, as well as the target child. A majority of home visitors resided in the counties in which the families lived. In North Carolina, African American home visitors were selected to make sure all home visits to African American families included a home visitor of the same race. Two home visitors visited the families at each time point in order to collect the data in a timely fashion and to ensure that all tasks were completed successfully. At the 6-, 15-, 24-, and 36-month assessments, visits were made to the children's most-used child care setting if the child was in any form of child care for a total of 10 hours a week or more. Phone calls were made to each family approximately every four months between designated assessments, in order to gather updated information about family moves.</p>\n\n<p>Home visits lasted approximately 2-3 hours and consisted of a variety of interviews, questionnaires, videotaped interactions between the primary caregiver and the child, the secondary caregiver and the child, and direct child assessments. Questionnaire, interview, and direct assessment data were collected on laptops. To ascertain reading levels, all primary and secondary caregivers completed the KFAST literacy screener (Kaufman and Kaufman, 1994) during their first visit. Participants who read at an 8th grade reading level or above were given the opportunity to complete questionnaires on their own (86 percent sample), whereas those who read below an 8th grade reading level had questionnaires read to them by one of the interviewers. For confidential information, informants were given a key pad so that the interviewer would not know the answer to the question.</p>\n\n<p>Child care visits were conducted after contacting families to obtain the name and address of the child care person and to get written permission to visit the child care setting. We visited 72 percent of the child care settings over the course of the first three years. The setting could be in the child's home or another home or formal child care. The caregiver could be a relative, babysitter, biological non-residential father, residential grandmother who was not a primary or secondary caregiver, and other related or non-related adults. Child care visits were completed by interviewing the caregiver about the setting and her/his background characteristics and\nthrough observations of the setting over about a one and a half hour time period.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>Information from home visits, childcare visits, and phone calls was collected on the following domains of interest:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Attention</li>\n<li>Adult Literacy and Cognition</li>\n<li>Adult Relationships</li>\n<li>Child Behavioral Measures</li>\n<li>Child Cognitive Measures</li>\n<li>Child Temperament</li>\n<li>Child Care Information</li>\n<li>Community and Neighborhood Environment</li>\n<li>Demographics</li>\n<li>Emergent Literacy</li>\n<li>Executive Functioning</li>\n<li>Genotyping Data</li>\n<li>Home Environment</li>\n<li>Income and Assistance</li>\n<li>Language Development</li>\n<li>Parent Mental Health</li>\n<li>Parenting</li>\n<li>Physical Health</li>\n<li>Rurality</li>\n<li>Stress</li>\n<li>Support</li>\n<li>Work and Job Characteristics</li>\n</ul>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"childhood"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"emotional development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"poverty"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rural population"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CCEERC II.

Low-income families and African American families (North Carolina only) were over-sampled. A broad definition of rural was used, which included counties with small to medium sized towns with little access to large metropolitan areas and the resources those areas might provide. There are four areas of the United States that have been previously identified as having high rates of rural poverty (Dill, 1999) and this study sampled from two of these areas, Appalachia and the African American South.</p>\n\n<p>County inclusion criteria was: counties with no town with a population of greater than 50,000 and counties where nearly half the elementary age children were eligible for free and/or reduced lunch (children would be within 180 percent of the national poverty line). Counties that were adjacent to large metropolitan areas were excluded, so that target counties could not be considered suburban. Counties that were remote and completely rural were also excluded. Using this definition, 28 counties in Pennsylvania and 40 in North Carolina met our definition of \"rural\" and poor, with Beale codes of 3, 4, and 6. Within these counties, geographic clusters were identified to reduce data collection and recruitment costs. Demographic factors (poverty and African American race) were also considered. Six counties meeting the above criteria were chosen.</p>\n<p>Next, families were sampled from hospitals. In the Pennsylvania counties, there were seven hospitals that delivered babies. Given prior hospital administrative data regarding the number of\nbirths expected to occur, four of the seven hospitals were randomly selected to participate. In the North Carolina counties, there were only three hospitals that delivered babies so further sampling was not needed. There were additional considerations for sampling of the families including representative sampling for high-risk births, and attention towards the number of days a week and which days a week families were sampled. Three criteria were used to exclude families from participation: non-English speaking families, families intending on moving within the next three years (such as, military enlistment), and families where the state had terminated parental rights (such as, women in prison) were all excluded. Families were classified into low income status based on self-reports including social service use, highest education achieved, and household income, which served as inclusion criteria. In North Carolina, race was also considered as inclusion criteria due to the oversampling of African American babies, whose race was designated by mothers.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The Weights data file (part 0095) contains all weight variables created for use with analysis.
