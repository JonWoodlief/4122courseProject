This panel study about the British general  election of February 1974 was conducted with a sample of electors in  80 constituencies who had previously been interviewed twice, once in  1969 and again after the 1970 general election. This data collection  contains information gathered in the third wave of the study, known as  the February 1974 cross-section panel survey. It includes data  gathered from participants who were interviewed in 1970, of whom about  half had also been interviewed in 1969. As with other surveys in the  series, electors in Northern Ireland and the Scottish Highlands and  Islands were excluded from the sampling frame. Interviewed in  March-April 1974, respondents answered questions relating to the mass  media (e.g., attention to newspapers and television and perceived bias  in newspapers), their first and second choices in the 1974 general  election, and their opinions of the Conservative, Labour, Liberal,  Scottish Nationalist, and Plaid Cymru political parties (e.g.,  perceived difference among parties, knowledge of party  position/record, party identification, and the strength of party  preference). Respondents were asked for their views on a range of  social issues relating to domestic and foreign affairs, with emphasis  on the economy and the Common Market. Respondents were then asked how  the parties stood on each issue, and how much that influenced the  respondent's vote. Some of the issues included rising prices, strikes  in general, the miners' strike, taxation, the Common Market, social  services, nationalization, wage control, and the amount of power held  by unions and by big business. Respondents were also asked for their  perceptions of class conflict and their predictions for Britain's  future economy. Finally, respondents rated the political parties and  several politicians, and commented on the effect of government on  their own well-being. Background information includes age, sex,  marital status\n, place of residence during childhood, subjective class,  forced subjective class, family class, tenure, type and length of  residence, employment status, degree of responsibility in and training  for job (respondent and spouse), experience of unemployment in  household, income trade union membership (respondent and spouse), and socioeconomic group."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic
