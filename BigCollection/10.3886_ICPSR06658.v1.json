Part 1, Candidate Master Data, contains a record for every  registered candidate for federal office. Each of these records  includes the candidate's name, identification number, address, party  affiliation, incumbent/challenger status, and the identification  number of the candidate's principal campaign committee. Part 2,  Committee Master Data, includes a record for every registered  political committee, unauthorized delegate filer, independent  expenditure filer, and communication cost filer. Included in this file  is the identification number, name, address, treasurer's name, party  affiliation, report filing frequency, and special interest group  category of each of these entities. Part 3, Itemized Record of  Contributions to/Disbursements on Behalf of Candidates, comprises  records of reported contributions to candidates and disbursements on  behalf of candidates by political committees, unauthorized delegate  filers, independent expenditure filers, and communication cost filers.  Information in this file includes the identification number of the  contributing/disbursing entity, type of report, and the date, type,  and amount of each transaction. Part 4, Itemized Record of  Individual/Candidate Contributions, furnishes records of receipts of  contributions from individuals, from candidates to their own  campaigns, and disbursements to refund contributions to individuals,  as reported by candidates and their committees, other political  committees, and persons making independent expenditures. Part 4 also  covers the tracking of contributions that individuals earmarked for a  specific candidate as they proceeded through intermediaries registered  with the FEC.
