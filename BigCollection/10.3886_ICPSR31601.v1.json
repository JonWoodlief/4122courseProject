Agencies did not formally administer the screening tool in its entirety, but integrated select sections, questions or administration protocols into client intake or assessment interviews. Prior to field application, researchers conducted trainings on tool administration with participating staff at each agency. Trainings began with brief discussions of the difficulties in identifying human trafficking, the limitations of existing data and data collection strategies, and the critical need for a versatile and standardized screening tool. Participants were presented with the pilot version of the NYCTAP screening tool and an annotated guide to the tool (also in its pilot version). Agency debriefings were conducted as semi-structured interviews, three with individual staff representatives (i.e., \"individual sessions\"), two with multiple staff (i.e., \"group sessions\"). Feedback was used to further revise the screening tool and annotated guide to the screening tool into the final versions.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The New York City Trafficking Assessment Project (NYCTAP) screening tool contains the following sections:\n<ul>\n<li>Section 1: Screening background (Q1a - Q1f);</li>\n<li>Section 2: Personal background (Q2a - Q3d);</li>\n<li>Section 3: Migration (Q4a - Q7e);</li>\n<li>Section 4: Employment (Q8a - Q9c); and</li>\n<li>Section 5: Working/living conditions (Q10a - Q16c).</li>\n</ul></p>\n<p>Part 1 (Community Advisory Board (CAB) Agency Reviews Qualitative Data) focuses on Agency intake and screening, general feedback on the NYCTAP screening tool and specific (question level) feedback on the NYCTAP screening tool.</p>\n<p>Part 2 (Community Advisory Board (CAB) Agency Interviews Qualiatative Data) addresses the topics of Agency definition of human trafficking, evolution of the agency's human trafficking work and program components, main channels of client referral, client intake processes and documentation, client protection, rapport building, and screening accuracy, challenges of T-Visa application, and research and data to improve victim assistance.</p>\n<p>Part 3 (Law Enforcement Agency Reviews Qualitative Data) focuses on general feedback on NYCTAP screening tool and specific (question level) feedback on NYCTAP screening tool.</p>\n<p>Part 4 (Community Advisory Board (CAB) Agency De-briefings Qualitative Data) focused on field application, general impressions on usability, content domains (comprehensiveness, section organization, question wording and question placement), and adminstration domains (response format, recording and coding, screening timing and participation, interviewer-respondent rapport, client protection protocols, and non-English language screening).</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"exploitation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"human rights"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"human rights violations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"human services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"human trafficking"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"identured servants"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"service providers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sex trafficking"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"slavery"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
