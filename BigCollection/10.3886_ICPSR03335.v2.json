The Chicago Alternative Policing  Strategy (CAPS) was an ambitious plan to reorganize the CPD,  restructure its management, redefine its mission, and forge a new  relationship between police and city residents. With more than 16,600  employees, the CPD is the second largest police department in the  United States, serving nearly three million people and responding to  calls over a 225-square-mile area. The size and complexity of the CAPS  initiative generated significant changes in the department's structure  and goals during a multi-year implementation effort, which began in  April of 1993. After an experimental period in five police districts,  the program was expanded to encompass the entire city. A key aspect of  the CAPS program was the implementation of a problem-solving model for  policing. Within the CPD, a problem was defined as a group of related  incidents or an ongoing situation that concerned a significant portion  of those who lived or worked in a particular area. Although dealing  with crime remained at the heart of the police mission, it was  envisioned from the beginning that the police mandate would coordinate  responses to a broad range of community concerns, including social  disorder, municipal service problems, and code enforcement matters  previously handled by civil courts. Accord\ning to this strategy, teams  of officers were given long-term assignments to each of the city's 279  police beats. They were to spend most of their time responding to  calls and working on prevention projects in their assigned areas. To  enable them to do so, rapid response units were assigned to excess or  low-priority calls. The problem-solving efforts of beat officers were  supported by a coordinated system for delivering city services. Beat  sergeants were responsible for coordinating their efforts across a  24-hour clock. One mechanism for doing so was beat team meetings that  brought together all of the officers serving the area on all  watches. Beat sergeants, in turn, reported to a lieutenant charged  with coordinating their projects across a larger geographical  area. The views of the community were represented through District  Advisory Committees (DAC), in which policies and strategies were  discussed with commanders, and through monthly community meetings held  in every beat. Another important feature of Chicago's problem-solving  infrastructure was training for both neighborhood residents and  police. Residents were expected to take an active role as partners with the police and on their own."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This evaluation of the CAPS program included  surveys of police officers, residents, and program activists. In  addition, observational data were collected from beat meetings, and  aggregate business establishment and land-use data were added to  describe the police beats and districts. Parts 1-13 contain data from  surveys of police officers conducted between 1993 and 1999. For Part 1  (1993 Prototype District Training Officer Survey Data) surveys were  distributed in the spring of 1993 to personnel serving in five CAPS  prototype districts as they assembled in groups of 25 to 40 for an  initial orientation session at the training academy. Twenty-four  sessions were held over a few weeks. The questionnaires were briefly  described by evaluation staff members who attended each briefing, and  the same staff members collected the questionnaires for keying. The  same questionnaire was also distributed to members of the exempt staff  at a morning meeting in the summer of 1993. For Part 2 (1993  Comparison Districts Roll Call Officer Survey Data) surveys were  distributed during roll call in five districts selected to match the  CAPS prototype areas. They were administered on all shifts to officers  passing through roll call. This survey was much shorter than that for  the prototype officers to facilitate roll-call administration. Part 3  (1994 Supervisor Training Officer Survey Data) surveys were  distributed during training for sergeants in all districts. They  included 81 questions that were largely a subset of the 1993 prototype  district survey (Part 1). Part 4 (1995 Patrol Division Training  Officer Survey Data) surveys were conducted at the beginning of  two-day training sessions on CAPS and problem-solving. Part 5 (1996  Exempt Staff and Senior Managers Training Officer Survey Data) surveys  were conducted during one of the last in a weekly series of training  sessions for exempt staff and civilian managers. Part 6 (1997 Training  for Assorted Managers Officer Survey Data) surveys were administered  at training for captains, lieutenants, sergeants, and civilian  employees at the 911 Center. The training covered leadership and  management under CAPS. The questionnaire closely paralleled the one  distributed during the 1996 exempt staff training (Part 5). Part 7  (1997 Beat Team Leader Training Officer Survey Data) surveys were  conducted at training for beat team leaders (sergeants) in beat plan  development and supervision of patrol. Officers were trained in about  15 different groups. At the first half of the sessions, the  questionnaires were administered before the training began, and at the  other half, at the end of training. Part 8 (1998 Beat Meeting Officer  Survey Data) surv\neys were administered to officers attending beat  community meetings. Due to the fluid nature of beat meetings with  officers coming and going, and because some officers attended out of  uniform, it was difficult for the observers to assess the completion  rate for the survey. More complications were introduced by the fact  that some officers attended multiple beat meetings at which  questionnaires were distributed. They were to be completed each time,  but some officers either misunderstood the request or did not want to  complete a questionnaire that often. Part 9 (1998 Twenty-Five  District Roll Call Officer Survey Data) surveys were administered  during Monday through Thursday afternoon roll call. The 3:00 p.m. and  4:00 p.m. roll calls were surveyed because these officers had the  greatest involvement in CAPS, and officers who worked Mondays through  Thursdays were most likely to be involved in community meetings and  beat meetings. Generally the watch commander or sergeant in charge  introduced the evaluation staff, who then explained the purpose of the  survey and described its confidentiality. Officers were asked to put  their completed questionnaires in a large envelope labeled  \"Northwestern University\" before leaving roll call. For the most part,  officers were receptive to the survey, but a few in each group refused  to fill it out. Part 10 (1998 Beat Facilitation Training Officer  Survey Data) surveys were administered to officers at beat  facilitators training. Part 11 (1998 Beat Facilitation Training  Citizen Survey Data) surveys were administered to civilian beat  facilitators with questions similar to those in Part 10. Part 12 (1999  Beat Team Leader (Sergeant) Training Officer Survey Data) surveyed  sergeants during beat team leader training. Part 13 (1999 Sector Team  Leader (Lieutenant) Training Officer Survey Data) surveyed lieutenants  during beat team leader training. Parts 14-20 and 46 contain data from  eight city-wide sample surveys conducted for the CAPS evaluation. The  surveys were conducted by telephone using random-digit dialing  samples. Part 14 (1993 Citizen Survey Data) was conducted in English  only and the results for Latinos should be interpreted with  care. Parts 15-20 and 46 (1994 through 1999 and 2001 Citizen Survey  Data) allowed respondents to choose to be interviewed in Spanish.  These files contain a variable that identifies the language in which  the interview was conducted. Parts 14-20 and 46 contain weight  variables that can be used to correct the observed sample for  household size and number of telephone numbers. Surveys for Parts  14-17 (1993 through 1996 Citizen Survey Data) were conducted by the  Northwestern University Survey Research Laboratory. Surveys for Parts  18-20 and 46 (1997 through 1999 and 2001 Citizen Survey Data) were  conducted by the Survey Research Laboratory of the University of  Illinois-Chicago. Detailed methodology reports for Parts 14-20 and 46  from the principal investigators are provided in the PDF documentation  for this data collection. Parts 21-26 contain data from two  observational studies of beat community meetings in Chicago. Two kinds  of data were collected: (1) systematic observations of the meetings,  and (2) questionnaire responses from citizens who attended the  meetings. Parts 21-23 contain data from beat community meetings  conducted during 1995 and 1996. There was one observation in each of  165 beats, which were selected to provide an approximately 50-percent  sample of all beats in the city (Part 21). There were 2,145  respondents to the participant survey (Part 22), and a sample of 291  respondents were later recontacted and reinterviewed after four months  to assess their subsequent involvement in problem-solving activities  (Part 23). Parts 24-26 contain data from beat meetings observed in  1998. There were a total of 459 observations of 253 beats. Part 24  contains the data from the main observation form, and Part 25 contains  t\nhe coding of problems and issues discussed. These two parts can be  linked by beat and date. For city-wide analysis, a weight variable can  be used to weight cases by the inverse of the number of times they  were observed so that the apparent number of cases is 253, the number  of beats observed. There were also 5,293 participants surveyed in  either English or Spanish (Part 26). A methodology report for the 1998  beat meeting observation study from the principal investigator is  provided in the PDF documentation for this data collection. The  approach for the data collection and difficulties in field operations  described in this report were typical for the 1995 data collection as  well. Parts 27 and 28 contain panel data from residential surveys  conducted in the five original CAPS prototype districts and in a set  of matched comparison areas. Part 27 contains the responses from Wave  1 of the resident surveys conducted in 1993. Part 28 contains data  from the same residents who were reinterviewed a year later. To  prepare for the evaluation, 1990 Census tract data were used to select  large, mainly contiguous sections of the city that closely matched the  demography of the five newly-announced prototype areas. These  comparison areas were used to represent what would have happened in  the prototype districts if there had been no CAPS program, for the  program was not put in motion there until the end of the prototyping  period. The matching factors for selecting the comparison areas were  race and ethnicity, home ownership, and the percentage of residents  living in buildings of ten units or more. Because none of the CAPS  prototypes included large blocks of public housing, those areas of the  city were avoided. Parts 29-32 contain data from four annual surveys  of CAPS activists. The data from 1996 to 1998 were collected by the  Institute of Policy Research, while the 1999 survey was conducted by  the Metropolitan Chicago Information Center. The samples were  convenience samples of activists identified in a variety of ways, and  each year complete respondents from the previous year were retained  again in the sample. Each year the scope of the sampling base and the  size of the survey grew. Respondents were selected from members of the  District Advisory Committees (DAC), chairs of DAC subcommittees,  activists nominated by the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety  (CANS), trainees at CANS biannual training sessions, registrants at  city-wide workshops, beat facilitators, executive directors of  community organizations, and nominees of other respondents. For Part  33, data were collected to evaluate a program to train citizens in  problem-solving, in a joint effort between the Chicago Police  Department and the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety.  Questionnaires passed out at training sessions provided baseline data  on trainees. Those questionnaires were also used to select respondents  for follow-up telephone questionnaires, which were administered three  months later (Part 34) to assess their later involvement in  problem-solving activities. Parts 35-37 contain data from three  neighborhood surveys. The survey in Part 35 was conducted by the  Institute for Policy Research in 1997 as part of a problem-solving  study in 15 Chicago neighborhoods. The survey in Part 36 was fielded  in 1998 in 29 beats in anticipation of an effort by the city's CAPS  Implementation Office to organize communities, increase attendance at  beat meetings, and involve residents in problem-solving. Part 37  contains data from a 1999 survey of six beats with predominantly  African-American residents. Parts 38 and 39 contain data coded from  police reports of beat community meetings. Police attending each beat  meeting completed a two-sided report form titled \"Beat Community  Meeting Log,\" which was then approved by their sergeant. Part 38  contains attendance information for every beat community meeting held  between January 1995 and Dece\nmber 2000. For Part 39, three coders  spent two months intensively coding 2,580 beat community meeting logs  for 1998. They recorded basic information about the meeting, who  attended, and what was talked about. There are data for 277 of 279  beats, because no one attended the few meetings held in two completely  nonresidential beats in the central business district. A few other  nonresidential beats did manage to attract business owners and  location association members, and they are also included in this data  collection. Beats that were subdivided and held regular sub-beat  meetings appear in the data file as separate records with the same  beat number, and they are flagged by a sub-beat variable. Some beats  also held joint meetings on occasion, and the data for these meetings  are duplicated under each beat number in the data file. The data file  contains a weight variable to adjust the data for multi-beat  meetings. In Part 40, survey data were gathered from hundreds of  organizational informants on the roles that their groups played in  Chicago's community policing program in 1994. It documented how they  mobilized to influence the shape of community policing in the city's  five prototype areas. The goal of the survey was to determine to what  degree community organizations in the five prototype districts were  involved in and were promoting CAPS during its first year of  implementation. In particular, the survey was designed to capture  information on differences in CAPS involvement among various community  organizations, and among the five prototype districts in which it was  being tested. The operational definition of a community organization  was a turf-based group with a name. The survey was budgeted to yield  data on 50 organizations in each of the five prototype districts, or a  total of 250 organizations. Each organization was to be represented by  two respondents who were knowledgeable about their group. When they  were available, the names of individual respondents associated with  each organization were included on a call sheet for that group. These  respondents were often the heads of the organizations, or other  high-level personnel. When there was no valid name on the call sheet,  interviewers were instructed to ask for the person who was most  knowledgeable about the organization, perhaps the executive director  or president of the organization. Interviewing was conducted by  graduate students, professional interviewers, an Illinois Criminal  Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) staff member, a temporary  employee, and the project manager. Parts 41 and 42 contain counts of  business establishment types for Chicago aggregated to the beat level  and district level, respectively. These data were compiled from a  proprietary database of 94,058 business address listings purchased  from Claritas Corporation, dated circa 1998. Parts 43 and 44 contain  land-use data aggregated to the beat level and district level,  respectively. These data were aggregated from a parcel-level land-use  file belonging to the city of Chicago. Part 45 provides a crosswalk  between Census and Chicago Police Department area designations. The file is organized so that each record is a census block group."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Parts 1-6 include variables about general job  satisfaction and features of the officers' work, features they wanted  to have in a job, the effectiveness of various patrol activities, the  desired allocation of resources to traditional and new modes of  service, how they spent their time, the activism of neighborhood  residents, sources of information about their beat, their perceptions  of police work, their personal qualifications for CAPS, and what they  anticipated would be the impact of CAPS on assorted department  activities. Additional variables specify sex, race, marital status,  age, years on assignment, years with department, age when joining the  department, rank, shift, education, an\nd district assignment. Part 4  also includes a nine-item quiz of officers' knowledge of CAPS  procedures and concepts, their prototype experience, and their  perceptions of summer 1994 roll-call training. Part 7 provides  information from officers on public and department support for CAPS,  how realistic assumptions were about supervisors, beat team officers,  and the community, beat plans, Information Collection for Automated  Mapping (ICAM) and city services, beat problems, beat team meetings,  and a grade for their personal CAPS activities. Additional variables  specify sex, race, age, rank, and district and beat assignments. Parts  8-10 and Part 13 describe officers' attitudes toward beat meetings,  their roles at the meetings, their perceptions of the community and  problem-solving, the implementation of various elements of CAPS, their  own problem-solving activities, the roles of their supervisors and  their contacts with organizers and trainers. Also provided are  officers' sex, race, and age. Part 11 includes the same variables as  Part 10, as well as items about citizens' contacts with various  police, beat, and district advisory committees, and contact with  organizers and trainers. Other variables cover sex, age, race, length  of residence, housing tenure, and education. Part 12 includes items  similar to those in Part 10, as well as variables on public and  department support for CAPS, beat team meetings, the roles of  supervisors, views of the realism of assumptions about the  capabilities of beat team officers and the community, beat and  district plans, the use of ICAM and city service request forms,  sources of information about problems, a self-rating of officers' own  CAPS activities, when officers became beat team leaders, and what  their regular job assignments and district assignments were. Variables  in Parts 14-20 and 46 include how long the resident had lived in  Chicago, types of problems in the neighborhood, satisfaction with  quality of life in the neighborhood, evaluations of police  performance, knowledge of community policing, and sources of news and  other information. Demographic variables include age, sex, race and  ethnicity, marital status, employment status. Political orientation is  provided (only in Parts 14-20). Variables in Parts 21, 24, and 25  include number of beat meeting participants by race, number of police  officers by rank, number of representatives from block clubs,  organizations, or political offices, duties for which residents and  police officers were responsible, characteristics of police and  citizens relations, types of problems discussed, solutions proposed,  and actions taken, who led the meeting, whether there was an agenda,  who dominated the discussion, whether crime reports or maps were  available, and the types of information requested for the next  meeting. Variables in Parts 22, 23, and 26 include evaluations of the  abilities of police and citizens to address community problems,  citizens' expectations of police, involvement in community groups and  other organizations, how citizens learned about beat meetings, and  types of problems in neighborhood. Demographic variables include sex,  age, race, years of residence, household income, type of education  completed, housing type, and language of interview. Variables in Parts  27 and 28 include whether residents felt they were part of a  neighborhood, their satisfaction with the neighborhood, problems in  the neighborhood, whether residents participated in crime prevention  meetings, knowledge about crime prevention programs, how safe they  felt in their neighborhood, opinions about police, contact with the  police, and crime victimization within the last year. Demographic  variables include age, sex, race, employment status, marital status,  household composition, educational attainment, household income, and  language of the interview. For Parts 29-32 CAPS activists were asked  how long they were involved with CA\nPS, how they rated the regularity  and effectiveness of beat meetings, how they rated District Advisory  Committees and subcommittees, and whether the police had improved  their performance in terms of responsiveness to community concerns,  working with residents, crime prevention, and their general level of  concern regarding the community. Demographic variables include age,  sex, race, education, home ownership, and police district. Variables  in Part 33 include opinions about the abilities of police officers and  citizens to solve problems, police expectations about citizens and  citizens' expectations about police, citizens' willingness to take  responsibility for problems, willingness to encourage other citizens  to attend beat meetings, and participation in block clubs or other  organizations. Demographic variables include age, sex, race/ethnicity,  years of residence, type of housing, household income, and education  completed. Part 34 variables repeat those in Part 33, and also include  the number of beat meetings attended, how respondents heard about beat  meetings, satisfaction with training sessions, whether respondents  kept in touch with other participants from the training sessions,  whether they tried to teach others about community policing, contacts  with neighbors, police, city services, and politicians,  problem-solving activities, community relations, and level of  involvement in the community. Demographic variables include gender,  marital status, number of children, labor force status, and language  of questionnaire. In Parts 35-37, information is supplied on  residents' views of neighborhood problems, their awareness of CAPS,  their involvement in beat meetings, and reports of the quality of  police service in their community. Other variables measured features  identified as important components of the neighborhoods' capacity to  deal with problems: residents' participation in community-based  organizations and their perceptions of willingness of their neighbors  to intervene to reestablish order. Part 40 presents information from  organization leaders about when the organization had been established,  by whom it was founded, its goals and activities, types of meetings  held, contact with the media, fund-raising, CAPS-related activities,  opinions about police, sources of funding, office space, number of  staff, demographic composition of members, and the mission of the  organization. Parts 41 and 42 contain counts of different types of  business establishments, such as groceries, banks, restaurants,  insurance sales, auto, sewage, liquor, and construction, as well as  ranks of businesses based on size, sales, and employees. Parts 43 and  44 contain information on the percentage of land used for residential,  commercial, or manufacturing purposes, buildings, parks and  recreation, education and culture, religion, and parking, as well as  the condition and age of the buildings.

Use of this technique is important to  gather representative data, as over one-third of the households had  unlisted telephone numbers. In each household where an interview was  conducted, one adult, 18 years of age or older, was interviewed. These  individuals were randomly selected using the standard \"last birthday\"  technique. The PDF documentation for this data collection contains  methodology reports from the principal investigator that explain the  sampling procedures in greater detail. In Parts 21-23, observational  and participant survey data were collected for meetings in 165  randomly selected beats, approximately 50 percent of all beats in the  city. For Parts 24-26, observational and participant survey data were  collected for meetings in 253 of 270 residential beats in the  city. For Parts 27 and 28, the researchers were targeting relatively  small geographical areas that did not match telephone company  switching areas, so it was necessary to develop a sampling plan that  reached the target areas in a cost-effective fashion. To accomplish  this, half of the sample numbers for each area were selected at random  from an up-to-date reverse telephone directory. Because they were  listed numbers, the investigators could ensure that those households  lay within the targeted areas. The remaining sample of telephone  numbers was selected by randomly scrambling the last digits of the  listed numbers. Households responding to those numbers were then asked  a brief series of geographical screening questions to ensure that they  were within the targeted areas. In the end, there were 1,294 completed  randomly-sampled interviews and 1,278 listed-number interviews, for a  total of 2,572 interviews. For Parts 29-32, respondents were selected  by convenience and snowball sampling. For Part 33 beat training  sessions were randomly selected and all participants in the selected  sessions were surveyed. The sample also included all District Advisory  Council members for the district. Part 34 consists of a random subset  of the respondents surveyed in Part 33. For Parts 35-37, the telephone  number samples for each area were randomly drawn from a recent reverse  telephone directory to ensure that the numbers were within beat  boundaries. Part 38 contains data for all beat community meetings held  between 1995 and 2000. Part 39 contains data for beat meetings held in  277 of 279 beats in 1998. For Part 40, a list of turf-based named  groups, along with the names and telephone numbers of persons  associated with them, was developed from several sources. A start-up  list was contributed by a research team at DePaul University, which  shared an inventory they had developed for their own community  organization study. Northwestern and Illinois Criminal Justice  Information Authority (ICJIA) staff members supplemented this list  with organizations and contacts they came across while attending  various CAPS-related meetings, or doing interviews. Each time an  interview was conducted with an organizational informant they were  asked about other organizations that they had run across, to  contribute a snowball component to the sample. The investigators also  culled local news articles and newsletters to locate additional  organizations and named contacts to add t\no the list. Several key  community contacts in prototype districts were asked to go through the  lists for their areas and make additions and corrections to them. As  part of the evaluation of CAPS, team members conducted interviews with  district commanders, neighborhood relations officers, beat team  members, and other officers. Among other topics, lists of group names  and contacts were gleaned from these key informants. There was no sampling for Parts 41-45."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Parts 1-13, 21, 22, 24-26, 33, 34, 38, 39,  41-45: Not applicable.
