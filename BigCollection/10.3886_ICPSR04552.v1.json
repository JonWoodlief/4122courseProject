Data were collected using national random-digit  dial telephone surveys completed between March 19, 1999 and July 13,  1999. Sampling was suspended after the school shooting in Littleton,  Colorado on April 20, 1999, and resumed after a cool-down period.  Part 1, Survey Data, contains the coded data obtained during the  interviews, and Part 2, Open-Ended Verbatim Responses, consists of  open-ended answers provided by the respondents. Four qualifying  questions were asked, dealing with: (1) gun ownership, (2) gun display  against the respondent, (3) gun use in self-defense against another  person, and (4) the use of a weapon other than a gun in self-defense  against another person. A \"yes\" response to a qualifying question led  to a series of additional questions on the same topic as the  qualifying question. Information was collected from all respondents on  the perceived safety of their neighborhood, whether they would feel  safer if more people owned guns, whether guns should be allowed in  public places, whether gun injuries were a problem in their community,  whether they would favor or oppose a program to reduce gun injuries,  and whether they had ever been shot with a gun. Respondents living in  households that currently contained a gun were asked how many and what  type of guns were present, the main reasons for owning a gun, whether  any of the guns were loaded and unlocked, and whether they had  received formal firearms training. Questions about incidents in which  a gun was displayed in a hostile manner against the respondent  included the number of times it took place, how long ago it had  occurred, whether the respondent was in the military or police force  at the time, the location of the incident, whether the individual  displaying the gun was known to the respondent, whether the respondent  had a gun, and whether the police were contacted. Respondents who had  used a gun or other weapon in self-defense in the last five years were  asked about the number of times it took place, the location of the  incident, whether they were in the military or police force at the  time, the type of weapon used, whether they knew the other person,  whether this individual also had a weapon, whether the police were  contacted and arrests made, and what crime was committed. Additional  questions asked respondents whether they smoked cigarettes, drank  alcohol, whether they had gotten married, had had a fire in their  home, and had been hospitalized for a fracture in the past year, and  whether they had ever had contact with extraterrestrial life.  Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level,  household income, type of residential area (e.g., urban, rural, etc.), and age and number of children in the household."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fear of crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"firearms"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun ownership"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gun use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"handguns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reactions to crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personal security"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"self defense"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"weapons offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
