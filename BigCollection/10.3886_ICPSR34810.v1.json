Respondents reviewed information for a number of different potentially taboo plans, decisions, or proposals, such as human cell cloning, genetic modification of wheat, different insurance rates for smokers and non-smokers, and were then asked to give their opinions regarding those proposals. Respondents were given different reason sets to agree or disagree with, relative to each proposal, that ranged from whether the proposal was morally wrong to whether the proposal violates the norms of society.  If respondents did not agree with the proposal, they were asked additional questions.  These additional questions were used to assess whether respondents would agree with the proposal passing if there was a dollar amount that they would save as a result.  In this collection, the experiment had 22 scenarios and respondents were each given 11 of these scenarios.  Demographic variables included gender, age, native language, ethnic identity, and year in school."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This collection sought to better understand taboo responses, and to distinguish choices that are truly taboo from those that are actually difficult or confusing."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The experiment was based on questionnaires that described 22 mini-scenarios, covering a wide range of potentially taboo issues.
