College students receiving a degree at  the end of the June, 1961 term from an eligible institution of higher  learning were interviewed about their future cateer plans (Wave I or  Dataset 1). For the next three years (1962-1964) the same respondents  were reinterviewed to compare experiences with previous plans (Waves  II-IV). The second dataset includes the same four waves as the first  with a fifth wave condu\ncted in 1968 to study the attitudes of the  respondents after they had been out of college for seven years. Wave I  probed areas of career desire versus areas the respondent would  actually be involved in. The differences in their views from freshman  year to senior year were questioned. Other issues investigated were  financial desires for the future, peer group influence, and college  activities. Waves II through IV asked what the respondent was doing at  that time in relation to what he/she wanted or anticipated. Additional  areas such as career satisfaction and present goals were  ascertained. Wave V (appearing only in Dataset II) was directed to the  effect of college on the respondents' life. Again the respondent's  present activities were compared with his or her past goals. Personal information was obtained on every wave."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career expectations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career goals"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career planning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"college graduates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.
