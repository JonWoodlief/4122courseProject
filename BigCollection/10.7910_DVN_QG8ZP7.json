The study involved two stages viz., rapid remapping exercise followed by the sampling and quantitative survey. Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling method was adopted for selection of different clusters. With in different clusters a total of 1989 samples were collected (1189 FSWs and 800 MSMs) in different districts of AP,  Krisna and West Godavari districts both with 400 samples were selected for conducting the MSM data collection, while Krishna, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam  districts were selcted for FSW data collection. The eligible Female Sex Workers (FSW) taken in the study were females aged 18 years or older, either brothel or street or lodge or home based, who sold sex in exchange for cash at least once in the past one month.
