Female students at six coeducational colleges in Massachusetts were invited to apply for an internship designed to encourage and assist undergraduates to pursue careers in professional fields traditionally dominated by men.\n<br /><br />  A total of 413 applications were received over the two-year period of the program. Forty internships were awarded each academic year, 1973-1974 and 1974-1975. Interns were chosen by a panel of faculty fellows. Each applicant supplied a written essay or statement outlining her career goals and choices, a letter of recommendation from a faculty member or former employer, a college course transcript or performance evaluation, and answers to a mailed questionnaire. The 80 interns also\ncompleted a supplemental survey towards the end of their internship. This self-administered questionnaire explored factors influencing application for the internship, area of interest, the impact of the intern program office on campus, consultation received regarding the internship program, future education and career plans, experiences during the internship, and the influence of these experiences on future plans.<br /><br /> The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study\n(original record paper data).
