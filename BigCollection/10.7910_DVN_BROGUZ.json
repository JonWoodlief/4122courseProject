It represents my first cross-cutting cleavages dataset, which has now been super-ceded by the more extensive dataset in Political Analysis (PA).  \"Cross-fragmentation\" is now labeled \"Cross-fractionalization\" in the PA dataset.\n\nThe ideas relating to civil war have further been developed using the new dataset.  Indeed, the article coauthored with Josh Gubler (JCR) uses crosscutting measures between ethnicity & region & income.  It is also theoretically richer.\n\nNevertheless, this paper remains at the heart of my developing ideas & empirical measures relating to the resurrection of cross-cutting cleavages in the political science literature.  One of its primary purposes was to show that, contrary to Fearon and Laitin (2003), ethnic fractionalization by itself was a poor proxy for ethnic diversity and that diversity does affect civil war when measured more richly.","productionDate":"Production Date","UNF":"UNF:5:OSlBntfBkS2nPQWIPjPVYQ==","lastUpdateTime":"2011-05-14T10:12:12Z","releaseTime":"2012-11-26T00:00:00Z","createTime":"2011-05-14T07:57:29Z","license":"CC0","termsOfUse":"CC0 Waiver","metadataBlocks":{"citation":{"displayName":"Citation Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"title","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Replication data for: CROSS-CUTTINGNESS, CLEAVAGE STRUCTURES AND CIVIL WAR ONSET"},{"typeName":"author","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"authorName":{"typeName":"authorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Joel Sawat Selway"},"authorAffiliation":{"typeName":"authorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Brigham Young University"}}]},{"typeName":"datasetContact","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"datasetContactName":{"typeName":"datasetContactName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Joel Selway"},"datasetContactEmail":{"typeName":"datasetContactEmail","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"joel_selway@byu.edu"}}]},{"typeName":"dsDescription","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"N/A"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"“Cross-cuttingness, Cleavage Structures and Civil War Onset” (2011).
