The project used data from the National Survey of  Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a national probability survey  of children assessed following a child maltreatment report. Hypotheses  developed for the current research were: (1) Physically abused  children are more aggressive than children who experience other types  of maltreatment, (2) Child characteristics such as low academic  achievement, low social skills, hyperactivity-impulsivity-attention  (HIA) problems, and peer rejection are associated with higher  aggression at baseline and less improvement in aggressive behavior  over 18 months. (3) Caregiver characteristics such as caregiver  monitoring, harsh discipline, domestic violence, arrest, substance  abuse, and poverty are associated with higher aggression at baseline  and less improvement in aggressive behavior over 18 months (4) Higher  cumulative risk is associated with higher aggression at baseline and  less improvement in aggression over 18 months. (5) Males are more  aggressive than females. (6) Meaningful variation exists by gender for  child and caregiver characteristics associated with aggressive  behavior at baseline. (7) Factors associated with change in aggression over 18 months vary by gender."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data used for this project are from the National  Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), the first national  longitudinal probability study of child welfare to collect extensive  data from children, caregivers, teachers, and child welfare workers.
