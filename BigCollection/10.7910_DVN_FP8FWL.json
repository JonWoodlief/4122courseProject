Personal capacity significantly predicted transfer, while motivation to transfer, transfer design, supervisor and peer support positively correlated with training transfer. \r\nTheoretical implications: The Learning Transfer System Inventory factors remain relevant explanations for training transfer with in African agricultural research and development organizations. Certain work environments are likely to have new factors such as ‘Peer and supervisor’ support which operated as one explanatory factor for training transfer, showing the closeness of peers and supervisors in agricultural research and development settings. \r\nPractical implications: The international agricultural research network needs to pay attention to the trainees’ ability to transfer new training, particularly on workload related hindrances. \r\nOriginality/value: The study has tested out the applicability of the LTSI for international agencies that conduct training for agricultural research and development in Africa. Understanding personal capacity to transfer is critical in this context, suggesting that institutions need policies that enhance trainee capacity to transfer enacted, facilitated and enforced."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences","Earth and Environmental Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Training transfer"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"International agricultural research network"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Personal capacity"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Capacity building"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AGROVOC"},"keywordVocabularyURI":{"typeName":"keywordVocabularyURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_37836"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Africa"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CIAT Region"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Agrobiodiversity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CIAT Research Area"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Capacity building"},"topicClassVocab":{"typeName":"topicClassVocab","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AGROVOC"},"topicClassVocabURI":{"typeName":"topicClassVocabURI","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_37836"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Muthoni Andriatsitohaina, Rachel; Miiro, Richard Fred. 2016.
