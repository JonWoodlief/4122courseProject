The project began in 1984 and continued through 1988. The four treatments studied were in-center hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), transplantation from nonrelated, nonliving donors (cadaver transplants), and transplantation from related living donors (related transplants). A major advantage for the project in relation t\no other large-scale research studies on ESRD patients was access to comprehensive data bases maintained by the Michigan Kidney Registry (MKR) and the Organ Procurement Agency of Michigan (OPAM) to identify the sample and provide treatment and survival data. Records on medical expenditures for treatment were obtained from the United States' Health Care Financing Administration. Data on the quality of life during treatment were collected by personal interviews with patients over the four-year span needed to accumulate the desired number of cases. The personal interview schedule included measures of subjective well-being, such as mood states, satisfaction with various aspects of life, and other widely-used scales such as Activities of Daily Living, Sickness Impact Profile, and Bradburn Affect Balance Scale. Items on standard demographics, the clinical and symptomatic picture of the disease, and the respondents' social support systems were also included in the interview."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"activities of daily living"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"renal disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.

The plan was to accumulate at least 40   observations per treatment modality for each six month duration period   beginning at seven months after start of treatment for ESRD and   continuing through five years. Representative samples, stratified by   duration, were taken of all in-center hemodialysis patients.   Representative samples were also possible for CAPD patients in shorter   duration groups. CAPD patients of longer duration, however, were scarce   (this was a new treatment in Michigan in the early 1980s), so all   available patients were included. The number\nof transplant patients of   both types was also found to be insufficient to meet the quota for the   duration/treatment criteria. Therefore, all available transplant   patients meeting other criteria were selected to be interviewed, along   with a supplementary group of related transplant patients (defined as   anyone with onset after June 1981 who had ever received a related-donor  transplant)."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)  Transplantation, Dialysis, and Quality of Life in Michigan, 1984-1988","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":35582,"dataFile":{"id":2613467,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)  Transplantation, Dialysis, and Quality of Life in Michigan, 1984-1988","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
