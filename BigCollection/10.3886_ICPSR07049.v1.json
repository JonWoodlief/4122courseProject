The first sample (File 1) was drawn fr\nom urban zones of the three main cities in Chile: Santiago, Concepcion, and Valparaiso/Vina del Mar. The second sample (File 2) was drawn from agrarian workers in the north, central, and southern agricultural zones of Chile. The third sample (File 3) was drawn from agricultural zones throughout the country and included recipients of land through agrarian reform. Respondents in the first sample were questioned about their knowledge and attitudes toward Chilean agrarian reform, the importance of mining, agriculture, and industrial development, positive and negative effects of agrarian reform, and knowledge of the literacy campaign in Chile and its participants. Respondents in the second sample were asked about the purposes of agrarian reform, the necessary qualifications to receive land, attitudes toward Chilean agrarian reform, and the positive and negative effects of agrarian reform. Agrarian workers' attitudes toward agricultural cooperatives were also examined. The third sample's respondents, recipients of land through agrarian reform, were asked about the advantages of receiving land through agrarian reform. Additional questions ascertained their knowledge of the purposes of reform, their attitudes toward agrarian reform, and its positive and negative effects. The respondents' opinions about formal schooling for children in the area, as well as teaching of home crafts to local women and instructing local men in working the land, were also explored. Demographic variables include age and education. The respondents' gender and occupation were also ascertained for the urban sample (File 1)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agrarian reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agriculture"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"industrial growth"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"land distribution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"urban areas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
