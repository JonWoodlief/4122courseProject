Observers were 12 criminal justice majors and  graduate students at Armstrong Atlantic State University. The  observers, the Patrol Bureau Commander, four police precinct captains,  and approximately 15 police officers attended a one-day training  facilitated by three of the five principal investigators. The training  covered the goals and objectives of the project and the specific  purposes of the ride-along observations. Specific ways to conduct  observations were covered, and students were instructed specifically  on the accepted behavior of an observer during low-risk to high-risk  activities. Field observers used three major data collection  instruments in order to gather as much relevant information as  possible from a variety of sources and in diverse situations. The  Officer Form was an overall evaluation of the officer's  decision-making characteristics, Suspicion Forms captured information  each time an incident occurred, and a Suspect Form was a compilation  of data from the citizen who had the encounter with the  officer. Additional documents included informed consent forms, a card  detailing the langu\nage to be used for the initial contact with  citizens, and hourly activity forms. Beginning in April 2002 and  continuing through November 2002, field observers accompanied officers  in each of the four precincts and on all three shifts. Overall, 49  officers on 132 tours were observed forming 174 suspicions and making  103 stops. The student observer was introduced to the selected officer  and asked the officer to read and then sign the informed consent  form. The observers were told that they could utilize the first full  ride for building rapport. By design, observers were told by research  staff to arrange three ride-along tours with the same officer. If the  observer felt that he or she were familiar with the officers  decision-making style and working rules after one or more complete  ride-along, the observer could discuss with the on-site coordinator  whether he or she should ride with another officer. Decisions to move  from one officer to another were made by the on-site  coordinator. Observers attended every roll call for their shifts and  rode with officers through the entire eight-hour work shift, taking  notes of officers' activities and documenting each instance where the  officer formed a suspicion. They were trained not to record any  activities that were generated by radio calls, other officers, or  situations in which their officers served as backup. In routine  activities, observers watched the interactions between the officer and  suspect(s), documenting what they saw and the sequence of events as  they unfolded. After an encounter, the observer debriefed the officer  as to his or her thoughts during encounters and elicited the officer's  overall rating of the encounter. Observers were trained to make note  of times when officers seemed to take notice of something but not act  on it and to question the officer about his or her behavior at an  opportune time. After completing detailed write-ups of ride alongs,  observers would submit the forms to the on-site coordinator who would  then debrief the observer and elicit further explanation, if necessary."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data collected in this study include demographic  information about the officer such as age, race, sex, and educational  attainment.
