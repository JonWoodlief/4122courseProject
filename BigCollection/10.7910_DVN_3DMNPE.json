Motivated by a puzzling set of democratic transitions, we relax this assumption and examine how elite uncertainty about dictatorship – a novel and generalizable causal mechanism impacting democratization – can induce elite support for democracy. We construct a noisy signaling model in which a potential autocrat attempts to convince economic elites that he will be a faithful partner should elites install him in power. The model generates clear predictions about how two major types of elite uncertainty – uncertainty in a potential autocratic successor's policies produced by variance in the pool of would-be dictator types, and uncertainty in the truthfulness of policy promises made by potential autocratic successors – impact the likelihood of elite-driven democratization. We demonstrate the model's plausibility in a series of cases of democratic transition.\r\n<br></br>\r\nNote: The replication files consist of an explanation of how the contents of Table 1 are derived from the original data sources, and a Mathematica notebook with the code to replicate the figures in the paper and in the supporting information"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-06-05"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Dictatorship"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Democratization"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Elite"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Albertus, Michael, and Victor Gay. \"Unlikely Democrats: Economic Elite Uncertainty Under Dictatorship and Support for Democratization.\" <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>. 61 (3): 624-641.
