New York City residents were asked to give their opinions of New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Reverend Al Sharpton, as well as their opinions of mayoral candidates Michael Bloomberg (Republican) and Mark Green (Democrat). Regarding the mayoral race, respondents were asked how much attention they were paying to the upcoming election, for whom they would vote, whether that decision was firm, and whether they would vote for Giuliani if he were permitted to run for a third term. Regardless of how they intended to vote, respondents were asked who they thought was going to win the mayoral election in November 2001. Those queried were asked to compare the two candidates in terms of experience, political ideology, leadership qualities, and whether they had spent their campaigns explaining their platforms or attacking the opposition. Respondents were asked to identify the long-range issues facing New York City and to indicate which were the most important. Their views were also sought on the state of the New York City economy, their level of satisfaction with the quality of public schools in the city, and whether the Board of Education should increase teachers' salaries or hire new teachers. Additional questions regarding the election included how New York City residents felt about getting a new mayor, whether Giuliani should leave office as scheduled, extend his current term by three months, or be allowed to run for office again, whether the new mayor should have city government experience or bring a fresh approach to the office, how respondents felt about campaign financing, and whether Green and/or Fernando Ferrer ran a racially divided campaign during the Democratic run-off. A series of questions addressed respondents' reactions to and feelings about the recent terrorist attacks on the city. Topics covered whether respondents' daily routines had returned to normal, whether they were concerned about another terrorist attack on the city, whether they were concerned about exposure to anthrax, whether there were any places that they were less comfortable going to, whether there were any places that they were going to more often, and whether the financial district should still be concentrated in downtown Manhattan or moved elsewhere. Opinions were also gathered about the appropriate penalty for persons convicted of murder and the appropriate penalty for persons convicted of murder connected with terrorism. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, marital status, age of children in household, whether respondents' children attended private or public school, education, the importance of religion, religion, race, Hispanic descent, borough of residence, years in community, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bloomberg, Michael"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Giuliani, Rudolph"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"September 11 attack"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Sharpton, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist attacks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist threat"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
