The  projects are the Abecedarian Project and a related study, the Carolina  Approach to Responsive Education (CARE). Combined, the two studies  test the hypothesis that child care, home visit, and home school  resource interventions can enhance cognitive and academic outcomes for  children at risk for school failure due to factors such as poverty,  low maternal IQ, or low parental education. The study is a prospective  randomized trial with participants from low-income families either  participating in the planned \"treatment\" groups or serving as  untreated controls. All have been followed from birth to adolescence.  These studies provide the only experimental data regarding the  efficacy of child care interventions that began during early infancy  and lasted until the child entered kindergarten. In addition, the data  allow for tests of the efficacy of intervention during the primary  grades. The Abecedarian Project recruited children born between 1972  and 1977. At entry to school, half of the children within each of the  two randomized preschool groups were randomly assigned to receive a  home school resource teacher program during the first three years of  elementary school. Children recruited for Project CARE (Carolina  Approach to Responsive Education), however, were born between 1978 and  1980 and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: child  care plus home visits, home visits only, or control. All Project CARE  children assigned to either the child care plus home visit or home  visit only groups also received the home school resource teacher  treatment during the first three years of elementary school.  Essentially, three educational treatments were provided: educational  child care from six weeks to school entry, home visit from six weeks  to school entry, and home school resource services during the child's  first three years of school. They varied in terms of intensity and  orientation. The child care treatment was essentially child-centered  and offered the most intensive exposure to education. It involved the  child receiving child care at the child development center from  infancy until entry to kindergarten.\nThe home visit and home school  treatments were less intensive and were family-oriented, emphasizing  the role of the parent as a change agent in the child's development.  Participants were tested based on four different measurement scales:  maternal measures, quality of the family environment, cognitive  assessment, and academic achievement. The maternal measures include  variables such as marital status, maternal and paternal age,  education, and family socioeconomic status. The cognitive assessments  include the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18  months, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale at 24, 36, and 48  months, the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities at 30, 42, and 54  months, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at 60  months, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised  (WISC-R) at 6.5, 8, 12, and 15 years. Some of the tests were  administered in only one study for a particular age. These include the  Mental Development Index (MDI) at 3 and 9 months and WISC-R at 15  years (Abecedarian only). Some achievement tests such as Peabody  Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) were administered in the fall and  spring of the first two years of public school (kindergarten and first  grade if the child was at grade level both years) for the Abecedarian  Project. The Woodcock-Johnson was administered in the fall and spring  of the Abecedarian child's third year of school, in the summer  following their seventh and tenth years of school, in the fall and  spring of the Project Care child's first three years of school, and in the summer following their seventh year of school."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic achievement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cognitive functioning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"early childhood education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"intervention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marital status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"poverty"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"socioeconomic status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CCEERC I.
