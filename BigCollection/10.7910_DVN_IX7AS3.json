Radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves, excited by antenna structures placed near the wall of a tokamak, have to propagate through the scrape-off layer before reaching the core of the plasma. RF waves in the electron cyclotron and lower hybrid range of frequencies are commonly used to modify the current profile. In the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), electron cyclotron waves are expected to stabilize the neoclassical tearing mode by providing current in the island region.  While the effect of fluctuations on RF waves has not been quantified experimentally, there are telltale signs, arising from differences between results from simulations and from experiments, that fluctuations can modify the spectrum of RF waves. Consequently, pioneering theoretical studies and complementary computer simulations have been pursued to elucidate the impact of fluctuations on RF waves. These studies, using the full complement of Maxwell's equations for a cold, magnetized plasma, show that the Poynting flux in the wake of the filament develops spatial structure due to diffraction and shadowing. The uniformity of power flow into the plasma is affected by side-scattering, modifications to the wave spectrum, and coupling to plasma waves other than the incident RF wave. The Snell's law and the Fresnel equations have been reformulated within the context of magnetized plasmas. These are distinctly different from their counterparts in scalar dielectric media, and reveal new and important physical insight into the scattering of RF waves. All of these studies apply to the scattering of RF waves in any frequency range and for arbitrary variations in density."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"diffraction"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"edge turbulence"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"radio frequency waves"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reflection"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"refraction of RF waves"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"scattering of waves by turbulence"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/16ja/16ja037/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-16-37</a><br /><br />Partially supported by the US Department of Energy Grant numbers DE-FG02-91ER-54109, DE-FG02-99ER-54525-NSTX, and DE-FC02-01ER54648."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"16ja037_archival_manuscript.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":149395,"dataFile":{"id":3341466,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"16ja037_archival_manuscript.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":310930,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:168393eeb37-734034db2fdb","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e9de7e095dce382effba02b16657fc18","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e9de7e095dce382effba02b16657fc18"}}}]}}}
