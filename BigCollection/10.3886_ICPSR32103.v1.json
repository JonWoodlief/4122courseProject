The surveys were sent to 1,379 police agencies serving populations of at least 25,000. The survey sample for this study was selected from the 2000 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. All police agencies serving populations of at least 25,000 were selected from the LEMAS database for inclusion. Separate surveys were sent for completion by police chiefs and data analysts. Surveys were used to gather information on data sharing and integration efforts to identify the needs and capacities for data usage in local law enforcement agencies. The police chief surveys focused on five main areas of interest: use of data, personnel response to data collection, the collection and reporting of incident-based data, sharing data, and the providing of statistics to the community and media. Like the police chief surveys, the data analyst surveys focused on five main areas of interest: use of data, agency structures and resources, data for strategies, data sharing and outside assistance, and incident-based data.

Initially the Justice Research and Statistics Association convened focus groups of criminal justice professionals in Illinois, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania to determine what information should be gathered via the surveys for this study. As a result of the focus groups, two surveys were developed, one for police chiefs (Part 1) and one for data analysts (Part 2). In agencies without data analysts, any person filling that role was encouraged to complete the survey. To encourage participation, two mailings were sent. The first round of surveys was mailed in January 2004; a second set of surveys was mailed to nonresponding agencies in March 2004. In order to increase the probability that agencies would return the surveys, letters were included explaining the study. Self-addressed, prestamped envelopes were also included in the mailing and respondents were given the option of completing the survey online at the JRSA Web site.

Interjurisdictional data sharing and integration questions included whether the respondent's department was involved in a multi-agency effort to share/integrate data, what proportion of their agency's overall budget went to support data collection and analysis functions, and how often community leaders asked for data or statistics from their department.

Agency data structure questions included whether the agency has a crime analysis unit, number of analysts in the unit, average educational level of analysts, whether analysts receive special training, how crime analysis information is disseminated within the agency, whether the unit seeks assistance in data analysis from outside agencies, concerns analysts have about assistance from external sources, how up-to-date the technology used for data collection and reporting is, and how often the agency updates the technology. Data for programming and policy strategies questions included how often the data and statistical indicators were used in the agency, how often the agency provided data to policymakers for developing programs and policies, whether the agency had representation on a criminal justice coordinating council, advisory board, or task force, how the respondent would rate the media's understanding and reporting of data and statistics that they provided, and whether the agency provided a mechanism for data users to provide feedback. Interjurisdictional data sharing and integration questions included whether there was a citywide or countywide integrated information systems project underway, whether the respondent's agency participated in the integrated information system and what type of data they shared, whether the agency used data systems that were integrated with systems of other departments/agencies, whether the agency maintained integrated data systems, whether the agency had access to data systems that allow them to track offenders over time, how successful data sharing efforts were, how technical capacities of the agency compared to other neighboring jurisdictions, and what would concern the agency about sharing data with other criminal justice agencies. Incident-based data questions included whether the agency collected and reported incident-based (NIBRS) data and what obstacles the agency experienced with collecting and reporting NIBRS data.
