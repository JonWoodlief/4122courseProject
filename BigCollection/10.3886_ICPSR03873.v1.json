The research  objectives were (1) to compare arrestees who reported having  experienced domestic violence with arrestees who reported never having  experienced partner abuse, and (2) to examine the association between  types and severity of domestic violence victimization and substance use as reported by arrestees."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data for this research were collected in  conjunction with the National Institute of Justice's Arrestee Drug  Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) programs. At the time of this study's release,  the ADAM program was operational in approximately 35 cities  nationwide, providing national and local profiles of drug use within  arrestee populations and the monitoring of drug use patterns. An  extension and refinement of the previous Drug Use Forecasting (DUF)  program (see DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES,  1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]), the ADAM program (see ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE  MONITORING (ADAM) PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 1999 [ICPSR 2994],  2000 [ICPSR 3270], and 2001 [ICPSR 3688]) is the United States  government's primary source of information on drug use among  arrestees, and is one of the primary research tools on drug use,  crime, and other social indicators. Quarterly interviews with  arrestees selected using probability-based (for males) and convenience  sampling (for females) were conducted in jails and detention  facilities at each ADAM site. Urine samples were also collected and  tested for a core panel of drugs that included cocaine,  methamphetamine, marijuana, and opiates. Because the drug screen could  not detect drugs beyond 72 hours after use, only arrestees who had  been incarcerated 48 hours or less were eligible for  participation. The ADAM interview provided demographic and descriptive  data including race, age, marital status, source of incom\ne, screens  for substance abuse and dependency, treatment history, arrest and  incarceration experiences, and participation in local drug markets. At  the conclusion of the interview, respondents were asked to provide a  urine specimen. For the current study, when the ADAM process was  completed, women were asked to answer questions about domestic  violence. The domestic violence addendum was administered as part of  the ADAM data collection in San Diego, California, from August 2000  through May 2001. Prior to the introduction of the domestic violence  interview, ADAM staff participated in a three-hour training session  conducted by a victim advocate. Training included definitions of  abuse, theories about domestic violence, the potential for  re-victimization through the use of the interview, and discussion of  referral agencies. Definitions of abuse, including physical, mental,  and emotional abuse, developed by the Centers of Disease Control were  read to the respondents for clarity. Questions used in the interview  were developed using a modified Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus, 2000)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Respondents were asked a series of questions about  the types of intimate partner physical abuse (e.g., scratching,  pushing, throwing, biting, choking, punching, burning, and  hair-pulling), emotional abuse (things that made the victim feel  humiliated, controlled, isolated, or embarrassed), and sexual abuse  they experienced in their lifetime and in the last 12 months, the  frequencies of the abuse, what if any types of weapons were used in  the abuse (e.g., gun, knife, brass knuckles, or mouth), whether the  respondent received medical treatment and in what manner (from  paramedics, doctor, at a clinic or urgent care facility, or hospital),  whether there were witnesses to any of the abuse, whether a  restraining order was ever obtained and if so what type was obtained  (emergency, temporary, or permanent), and whether the abusive partner  complied with the conditions of the order. Respondents were also asked  about various substances (alcohol, marijuana, crack/cocaine, heroin,  PCP, LSD, methadone, crystal meth, and prescribed medications) that  the abuser may have taken and whether any substances were ever taken  prior to any abuse incident or in the most recent abusive incident.
