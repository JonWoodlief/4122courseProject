Federal guidelines require that  inmates participating in the RSAT program be separately housed and  incarcerated for 6 to 12 months, to allow enough time for effective  treatment. The objective of the program was to reduce the likelihood  of recidivism by treating substance abusive behavior through the  development of participants' cognitive, behavioral, social, and  vocational skills.

The study employed a redundant  design that combined a single group pre-post design with one that  split the sample into two cohorts. The single-group pre-post design  tested whether the likelihood of arrest and conviction after RSAT was  reduced from the baseline likelihood of arrest and conviction in the  year prior to incarceration. The sample was divided into two cohorts  in order to compare the pre-treatment arrest and conviction records of  a 70-person control group with the post-treatment arrest and  conviction records of a 57-person treatment group. Control group  members were matched to treatment group members on the basis of RSAT  outcome (completion, early release, termination due to noncompliant  behavior) and opportunity time for offending.
