Geographical maps drawn for each district were used to list all migrant worker residential areas and worksites and to select cluster areas within these sites for recruitment. Clusters were created by combining smaller sites and dividing larger sites such that each cluster offered an area with approximately 5000 male migrant workers. Three clusters were then selected randomly from within each district, and migrant men within the chosen clusters were systematically sampled to obtain a minimum of 2500 participants per state. The sample size was determined using an estimated proportion of 15% of men having sex outside marriage, an assumed difference of 3% increase in the proportion with every unit increase in degree of mobility, a confidence level of 95% and power of 80%. A total of 11 635 eligible male migrant workers satisfied the inclusion criteria: age 18 years or older, having migrated to at least two places in the past 2 years for work, and were selected for the cross-sectional survey. Of these, 145 (1.2%) men refused to be interviewed, and 271 (2.3%) men did not complete their interviews and were thus excluded from the analyses, providing our final sample size of 11 219. Interviews were conducted by multilingual graduates or postgraduates in sociology, anthropology or statistics. Interviewers were trained and experienced in quantitative data collection techniques and field-based public health and HIV/AIDS research. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews conducted in private locations close to the respondents' residence or workplace. Verbal consent was obtained from all respondents before being interviewed. Data quality and management involved immediate review by field staff after interviews to ensure accuracy and completion, same-day review by the field supervisor and weekly transport of surveys to the data management team. Trained data entry officers then entered the survey data weekly and processed it monthly to verify consistency and accuracy, using SPSS. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the institutional review boards of the Population Council and the University of Manitoba, Canada."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Quantitative and Qualitative (qualitative data will be provided upon request to distributor)"},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured questionnaire and Indepth interview guidelines"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Male migrant worker study at destination districts","label":"Male_Migrant_Workers_Destination.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131383,"categories":["Data (SPSS version)"],"dataFile":{"id":2423722,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Male_Migrant_Workers_Destination.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":12933226,"description":"Male migrant worker study at destination districts","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:91697","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:5:p06IAHL9NiCboUKCQV6Cmw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"419071319fa7c520e8b15e3ef87e82e1","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"419071319fa7c520e8b15e3ef87e82e1"}}},{"description":"Male migrant worker study at destination districts","label":"Male_migrant_workers-final.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131383,"categories":["Data (STATA version)"],"dataFile":{"id":2419670,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Male_migrant_workers-final.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":11957727,"description":"Male migrant worker study at destination districts","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:91034","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:5:RtIv5Qcad+plYFFIKrDVkQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"538fdf04444e2e19bdc763ed7bd02a33","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"538fdf04444e2e19bdc763ed7bd02a33"}}},{"description":"Questionnaire for male migration study at destination districts","label":"Male Migrant Workers questionnaire.pdf","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":131383,"categories":["Questionnaire"],"dataFile":{"id":2423723,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Male Migrant Workers questionnaire.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":149278,"description":"Questionnaire for male migration study at destination districts","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:91698","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d1eff9c2da2c5c3fa9cb3e395c3a03a7","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d1eff9c2da2c5c3fa9cb3e395c3a03a7"}}}]}}}
