Yet, individuals that are younger than 18 do typically not have this right since they are considered politically uninformed. However, recent evidence tentatively suggests that political knowledge of youths is endogenous to the voting age. I test the hypothesis that having the right to vote can stimulate the acquirement of political knowledge. Utilizing voting age discontinuities I employ a regression discontinuity strategy on Swedish register data to estimate the effect of early age voting right on political knowledge. The results do not support positive effects of early age voting right on political knowledge. Thus, we should not expect that 16-year-olds respond by acquiring more political knowledge if they are given the right to vote."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political knowledge"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data used in this paper contain individual level information and are considered highly confidential.
