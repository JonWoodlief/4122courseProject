The research team used qualitative company histories, company websites, and annual 10K reports to verify that the company was operating in 1995.  Researchers also used these sources to investigate contradictions across data sources regarding primary industry,  company status, and company name.  Final coding reflected the majority consensus across sources.  Next, the research team used the Directory of Corporate Affiliations, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), and the EPA's Permit Compliance System (PCS) to identify all facilities owned by the sample of firms between 1995 and 2000.  Researchers then gathered Facility Ownership Data (Part 2), resulting in 15,408 facility/year observations.</p>\n\n<p>The Clean Water Act prohibited the discharging of pollutants through point sources into waters of the United States without a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.  The NPDES permit translated general requirements of the Clean Water Act into specific requirements for each facility.  The Permit Compliance System (PCS) contained the NPDES permit program data on facilities permitted to discharge pollutants into United States waterways.  The research team gathered various types of PCS data from the EPA for facilities in the sample.  Permit Compliance System Facility Data (Part 3) were gathered on the 214 unique major NPDES permits issued to facilities in the sample.   Although permits were given to facilities, facilities could have one or more discharge points (e.g., pipes) that released polluted water directly into surface waters.  Thus, Permit Compliance System Discharge Points (Pipe Layout) Data (Part 4) were also collected on 1,995 pipes.</p>\n\n<p>The EPA determined compliance using two methods: inspections and evaluations/assessments.  NPDES permits contained effluent limitations on what and how much a facility could discharge as well as monitoring and reporting requirements. Facilities were required to take various measures of discharges into the water and submit reports of both permitted levels and actual effluent discharges to the EPA; these reports were called discharge monitoring reports (DMR). The PCS contained these data and allowed the EPA to calculate whether the facility was in violation of permitted levels (effluent or measurement violations) or whether the DMR report was late (reporting violations).  The PCS contained information on inspections and on other types of violations, including compliance schedule and single event violations, and also contained data on enforcement actions against facilities that have violations of any type.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, inspections involved some sort of site visit.  EPA inspections included reviewing DMR reports, interviewing knowledgeable facility personnel, inspecting the processes that generated and treated wastewater, sampling wastewater discharges, and reviewing how samples were collected and analyzed by the laboratory.  Inspections that involved sampling and reviewing laboratory procedures were not regularly scheduled.  They were targeted at facilities that showed evidence of permit violations or unusual trends/patterns in DMRs or labs that showed evidence of poor performance.  Permit Compliance System Inspections Data (Part 5) were collected on a total of 1,943 inspections.</p>\n\n<p>Compliance schedules were negotiated agreements between a pollution source and the EPA that specified dates and procedures by which a source would reduce emissions and, thereby, comply with a regulation.  Permit Compliance System Compliance Schedule Data (Part 6) were collected on a total of 3,336 compliance schedule events.  When facilities did not fulfill the agreement by the specified date they could be found in violation.  Permit Compliance System Compliance Schedule Violation Data (Part 7) were obtained for a tot\nal of 246 compliance schedule violations. Single event violations were violations that could not be otherwise classified (as compliance schedule or effluent violations). Permit Compliance System Single Event Violations Data (Part 8) were collected on 75 single event violations.</p>\n\n<p>The Permit Compliance System Measurement/Effluent and Reporting Violations Data (Part 9) contain the monthly DMR reports.  Thus, it provides information on two kinds of violations: (1) discharges that exceeded permitted levels and (2) reporting violations (late or incomplete DMR reports).  Permit Compliance System Measurement/Effluent and Reporting Violations Data (Part 9) were collected for 396,479 violations.</p>\n\n<p>The PCS contained information regarding state and federal enforcement actions against facilities that had violations of any type, including cooperative intervention strategies (e.g., phone calls, warning letters)  and more formal actions by the EPA (e.g., administrative order, enforcement conference, and emergency order) and other legal authorities.  Permit Compliance System Enforcement Actions Data (Part 10) were collected on 1,730 enforcement actions.</p>\n\n<p>Occupational Safety and Health Administration Data (Part 11) were collected on a total of 2,243 inspections.
