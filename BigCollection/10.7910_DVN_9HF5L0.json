Specifically the nonlinear system constructed by Zocco and Schekochihin (Zocco & Schekochihin 2011), which combines nonlinear  fluid equations with a drift-kinetic description of parallel electron dynamics, is studied. Significantly, this model is fully gyrokinetic, allowing for arbitrary $k_{\\bot \\rho I}$ where $k_\\bot$  is the perpendicular wave vector of the  fluctuations and $\\rho I}$ is the ion gyroradius. The model includes integral operators corresponding to gyroaveraging as well as the moment equations relating fluid variables to the kinetic distribution function. A large variety of exact symmetries is uncovered, some of which have unexpected form. Using these results, new nonlinear solutions are constructed, including a helical generalization of the Chapman-Kendall solution for a collapsing current sheet."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fluid equations"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gyrokinetics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"kinetic"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"symmetries"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"theory"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/18ja/18ja010/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-18-10</a><br /><br />R.L.W. was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Fusion Energy Sciences Postdoctoral Research Program administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) for the DOE.
