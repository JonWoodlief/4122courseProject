Respondents  were asked for their impressions of Lieberman, how his selection would  influence their decision to vote for Gore, whether they would vote for  a Jewish candidate for vice president, and whether they had any  feelings of prejudice against Jews. Those queried were asked how the  following facts about Lieberman affected their views of him: he is an  Orthodox Jew, as a senator he voted to keep late-term/\"partial birth\"  abortions legal, he was the first Democrat in Congress to publicly  criticize President Bill Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and  he represented the state of Connecticut as a member of the Senate for  12 years. Additional topics covered whether Lieberman's Orthodox  religious practices would interfere with his duties as vice president,  and whether Lieberman might try to influence United States policy  toward Israel based on his religious beliefs.
