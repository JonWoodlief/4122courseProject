Recent research has examined the distortionary effects of lobbying activities on this representational linkage. Here, I argue that the effect of interest groups on legislators’ behavior depends on the clarity of the majority’s preferences in a district. When the electorate is narrowly divided, Members of Parliament (MPs) may choose to reap the benefits associated with interest groups as costs from defection are lowest. The results show that MP defection from constituents’ preferences is only positively associated with sectional interest group ties when the constituency is narrowly divided on an issue. Likewise, MP defection is only negatively associated with MP’s ties to cause groups when the constituency is narrowly divided on an issue. These results are important because they specify the conditions under which interest group lobbying is sufficient to override constituents’ preferences."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-07-07"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Barceló, Joan. \"The clarity of the majority’s preference moderates the influence of lobbying on representation.\" Party Politics (forthcoming)"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354068817715803"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Barceló, Joan"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-07-18"}]}},"files":[{"description":"A dataset including all variables used for analyses in the paper.","label":"ReplicationData.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":127583,"dataFile":{"id":3036829,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/FHTQL5/EYKQGH","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FHTQL5/EYKQGH","filename":"ReplicationData.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":4265215,"description":"A dataset including all variables used for analyses in the paper.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15d552dc8c9-054170b2a692","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:dqLaIX7T3GzvWZorgkB+hA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"2bcc7c7c330bb10da28ceb272cd01204","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"2bcc7c7c330bb10da28ceb272cd01204"}}},{"description":"A R code that replicates the main analysis presented in the paper.","label":"Replication Files Party Politics.R","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":127583,"dataFile":{"id":3036828,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/FHTQL5/1VC1JS","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FHTQL5/1VC1JS","filename":"Replication Files Party Politics.R","contentType":"type/x-r-syntax","filesize":3792,"description":"A R code that replicates the main analysis presented in the paper.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15d552dc899-bafc4e58fee2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7184b11d7bd1129537b81790718e3502","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7184b11d7bd1129537b81790718e3502"}}}]}}}
