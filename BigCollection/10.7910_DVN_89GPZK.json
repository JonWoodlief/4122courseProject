Using binary logit model and multivariate probit model, this paper examined different factors influencing farmersTiO2-N’ decision on adaptation to climate change in their agricultural production. Training attendance, farm size, damage level, educational level, farming experience, access to credit, and gender were the factors that influenced significantly the probability that farmers would adapt to climate change. Of these factors, attendance in climate change training and farm size were the most important factors affecting the farmersTiO2-N’ decision on adaptation to climate change, while labor availability and membership in local organizations were not. Three policy recommendations were proposed to enhance small-scale farmersTiO2-N’ adaptive capacity to climate change in the region. These include: iTiO2-N). broadening of training courses on climate change; iiTiO2-N). institute policies that would promote consolidation of farmlands; and, iiiTiO2-N). integrate concepts of climate change and climate change adaptation into the operation of the local organizations."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences","Earth and Environmental Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Adaptive practices, Agricultural production, Binary logit model, Climate change, Factors affecting, Multivariate probit model"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Hamy, Tran"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-03-28"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Primary data_original_Thoai.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":134914,"dataFile":{"id":3137711,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/89GPZK/DNHMZD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/89GPZK/DNHMZD","filename":"Primary data_original_Thoai.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3123,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1626f9dc7ab-61dfda7b4da9","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:E58dZGHf8R4/YSv9DG3OtQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"44405b301f037d3fd521d1c55465ada0","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"44405b301f037d3fd521d1c55465ada0"}}},{"label":"Trinh_Ranola_Simelton_WTPAgr_LUP2017.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":134914,"dataFile":{"id":3137712,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/89GPZK/ST4VTY","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/89GPZK/ST4VTY","filename":"Trinh_Ranola_Simelton_WTPAgr_LUP2017.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":606164,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1626f9dce2b-e48159b0fce4","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6965e05a6074336acf6074fdb8cad1e0","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6965e05a6074336acf6074fdb8cad1e0"}}}]}}}
