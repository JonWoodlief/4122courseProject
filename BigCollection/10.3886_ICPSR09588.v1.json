Victims were  randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) Victims  were interviewed, with an impact statement written and immediately  distributed to the prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge on the  case, (2) Victims were interviewed to assess impact but no statement  was written, and (3) Victims were assigned to a control condition in  which there was no interview or statement. Subsequent interviews  evaluated victims' perceptions of their role in the proceedings and  their satisfaction with the outcome. Data were also recorded on  charges filed against the defendants (both the arraignment and final  charges), sentences, and special conditions of sentences. Standard  demographic information was gathered as well. The remaining variables  fall into two categories. The first category includes questions about  the defendant(s) in the case. For all defendants in each case (up to  six per victim) the researchers recorded information on the nature and  severity of the arraignment charges and final charges, and on the  sentence received. Additional information was recorded for the first  and second defendants in a case. This included information on special  conditions of the sentence such as a drug treatment program or  restraining order. Orders to pay restitution were noted. Also recorded  was information on the defendant's status with the criminal justice  system, including number of prior convictions and number of open cases  against the defendant. Finally, whether the Victim Impact Statement  appeared in the assistant district attorney's file on the case and  whether the statement had been opened were noted. The second category  of variables includes information about the victim's reactions to the  crime and the criminal justice system. Victims were asked to assess  the impact the crime had on them in terms of physical injury,  financial losses, psychological effect, and behavioral effect (i.e.,  changes in behavior resulting from the experience). They were also  questioned about their experiences with the criminal justice  system. The researchers inquired about their participation in the  sentencing decision, their satisfaction with the outcome, and how they  felt they had been treated by various court officials. Victims were  asked whether they felt that court officials were aware of and were  concerned about the effect the crime had on them. They were also asked  whether victims should have a greater role in the court proceedings  and whether court officials should be aware of victim impact as part  of the sentencing procedure. Finally, the researchers investigated whether the victims believed that going to court was a waste of time."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"convictions (law)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"court cases"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sentencing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"trials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victims"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
