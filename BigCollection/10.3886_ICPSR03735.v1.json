The ten cities varied in their  geographic properties and were characterized by their locations, e.g.,  South City, Metro City, and Coast City. Morality issues were defined  as issues concerning actions or behaviors that were regulated by a  deeply held belief and/or a religious value. The issues falling within  this categorization were gay rights, abortion rights, abortion clinic  protests, needle exchange programs for drug users, hate speech, hate  groups, gambling policies and regulations, animal rights, and  regulations pertaining to the sex industry, which included  pornography, prostitution, and adult entertainment. Incidents or  events in the ten cities related to these moral issues were  identified. The data were generated by scanning local newspapers to  isolate and gather relevant information about the selected cities,  interviewing political elites (e.g., mayor, city manager, and council  person), and reviewing public government records for the selected  cities. Part 1, Ten City Data, contains data on 451 incidents related  to morality issues in the ten cities. Part 2, Subset of Ten City Data  With City-Specific Variables, is a subset of the cases included in  Part 1 and also includes a broader array of city-specific contextual  variables. The variables shared by Part 1 and Part 2 are whether a  city had a mayor or a city manager, whether city council elections  were at-large or by district, the percentage or share of the city  council elected by a particular district, the strength and prevalence  of the city's homosexual community, the percentage of residents in the  county who attended religious services, the percentage of residents in  the county who identified themselves as Catholic or as religious  fundamentalists, and whether activists involved with this issue were  more likely to be from the left or right, politically. Additional  shared variables are city population in 1990 and 1998 (in thousands),  the percentage of population change between 1980-1990 and 1990-1998,  the metro area population in 1990 (in thousands), the percentage of  population change in the metro area from 1980-1990 and from 1990-1996,  the percentage of female, Asian, White, Black, and Hispanic residents,  the median household income, the percentage of married residents, the  percentage of female-headed households, the 1997 unemployment rate,  the percentage of same gender partnerships, the total number of  churches, the number of churches per capita, the percentage of  households with children under the age of 19, the percentage of the  population aged 18-34, the percentage of residents that were college  educated, income per capita, the percentage of foreign-born residents,  the percentage of resi\ndents living in poverty, and the acceptability  and prevalence of the city's \"unconventional\" or \"counter\"  culture. The variables contained only in Part 2, Subset of Ten City  Data With City-Specific Variables, are the type of community education  present, the type of social culture in the community, the percentage  of the work force employed in education or technology related jobs,  the percentage of women in the work force, and the total number of churches in the county."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion clinics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"advocacy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"animal rights advocates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community action"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gambling"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gay rights movement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"morality"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political elites"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pornography"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prostitution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"religious attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social movements"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social protest"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social values"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"FENWAY VI.
