One hundred and fifty-six couples planning marriage were recruited for a study of relationship development. Each couple participated in two pre-assessment laboratory sessions during which they completed several self-report measures and engaged in videotaped interaction sessions. Questionnaires focused on relationship satisfaction and expectations; interaction sessions consisted of couples either discussing the most important problem in their own relationship or a hypothetical marital dispute (selected from the Inventory of Marital Conflicts). During half of these interaction sessions, couples used a \"communication box\" to regulate and rate their interaction. This mechanism forced the participants to take turns speaking and allowed the listener to rate the communication s/he just heard.\r\n<br />"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<br />  After pre-assessment, eighty-six couples were offered the opportunity to participate in the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP), which is a 5-week relationship enhancement program focused around communication and problem-solving skills.

The thirty-three couples who participated became the experimental group, while the 43 who declined and the 70 who were not offered intervention served as control groups. All couples then participated in a post-assessment laboratory session which included self-report measures and interaction sessions similar to those in the pre-assessment.
