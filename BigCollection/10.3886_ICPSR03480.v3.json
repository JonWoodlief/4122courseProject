For the first topic, media exposure, respondents from each EU member country were asked to identify the specific types of media they accessed regularly (among a variety of television channels, daily and weekly newspapers, magazines, and radio stations) and the types of television programs they watched most frequently. In regard to information behavior, respondents were asked to identify what sources of media they used to obtain information about the EU, as well as which topics they preferred to find out about through television or daily newspapers. The survey also queried respondents about their opinion of how informatively, objectively, or favorably television or daily newspapers presented news about the EU. In addit\nion, respondents were asked about the extent of their interest in certain topics and their desire to obtain more information. Such topics include issues pertaining to the EU, facts about EU candidate countries, the opinions of people residing in other EU countries, and the contents of the respondent's national constitution and the treaties of the EU. Respondents were also polled about their knowledge and use of information services provided by the EU, their satisfaction with information received from these types of services, and how they preferred to communicate suggestions to the EU. For respondents who use the Internet, the survey asked them to identify their Internet access location, how often and why they visit the EU Web site (Europa), and topics they would like to find on the Internet, while all respondents were asked whether they would communicate with EU decision-makers online. For the second topic, EU enlargement and its expected effects, the survey polled respondents about their knowledge of EU candidate countries, whether they had visited or plan on visiting these countries, and with which countries they have connections. Respondents were asked about their views regarding how well-informed they felt about EU enlargement, which member countries would benefit from enlargement, criteria for membership, the positive and negative effects of the inclusion of new countries and the immigration of citizens, satisfaction with life in the future, and their participation in political debate about enlargement. For the final topic, support for European integration and decision-making in the EU, respondents were asked to identify the two most positive and negative aspects of the EU, as well as evaluate their favor towards the EU, the EU's priorities and effectiveness as a government, and the influence individuals, groups, and EU member nations have upon decision-making within the EU. In addition, the survey polled respondents about their attachment towards their community, region, country and the EU, and whether an advantage or disadvantage exists for their country, as an EU member, in defending its own interests. The survey also asked respondents other questions, including whether they support or oppose particular EU proposals or policies, whether politicians should express their views more often through the media, and to identify a responsible communications representative for the EU. Demographic and other background information includes respondent age, gender, nationality, marital status, left-right political self-placement, age when stopped full-time education, voting preferences for a \"General Election\" and referendum on the euro, household income, occupation, type and size of community, region of residence, and language of interview."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"euro"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European unification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information dissemination"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information users"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mass media"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"media use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political interest"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political parties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter preferences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
