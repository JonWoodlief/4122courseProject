The program evaluated the efficacy of experimental interventions designed to prevent, eliminate, or reduce HIV risk behaviors and developed new treatment interventions. All participants received the standard intervention, which consisted of street-based outreach and HIV prevention counseling. Those assigned to enhanced interventions received more counseling sessions, educational videos, social gatherings, and support group activities. The public-use data file contains 31,088 respondent records, collected from 21 CA program facilities in the United States and one facility each in Puerto Rico and Brazil. Hence, the process data file contains 23 records of facility information that can be linked to individual respondents. Respondent interviews include a baseline Risk Behavior Assessment (completed prior to first intervention) and a Follow-Up Assessment, conducted either three months or six months after the baseline survey. Respondent data were augmented with eligibility information, biological markers of drug use, HIV test results, and intervention assignment. At baseline and post-intervention, the surveys measured drug use and drug treatment, sexual activity and sex for money/drugs, arrests, work/income, HIV/STD/pregnancy status, perceptions of risk, and risk reduction behaviors. The process questionnaires were completed by staff or principal investigators at the 23 site locations. Process data describe the program structure and process, other intervention projects in the community, needle exchange programs and pharmacy syringe sales, and local HIV infection rates. Drugs reported on include alcohol, marijuana/hashish, crack/cocaine, heroin (including speedball), non-prescription methadone, other opiates,\nand amphetamines."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AIDS"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"counseling"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"intervention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"outreach programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk assessment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk factors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"treatment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVI.A.

These modifications should not affect the analytic uses of the public use files.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: All participants received the standard intervention, while those assigned to the enhanced intervention received more sessions. Additional information about the study interventions can be found in the codebook.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The original study protocol allowed for a follow-up window of six months. However, these guidelines were amended and the window expanded to fifteen months or longer in order to permit assessments of migrant populations, high rates of incarceration, or other difficulties making follow-up contact. In addition, some sites opted for a three-month follow-up window. To identify the follow-up time period, users should refer to the variable XDRBFINT, which records number of days between baseline and follow-up surveys.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Respondents were administered either the six-month Risk Behavior Follow-Up Assessment (RF4) or the three-month Risk Behavior Follow-Up Assessment (RF5), but not both. However, about 42 percent of respondents are missing a Follow-Up Assessment form. Under these circumstances (i.e., when the client was lost to follow-up), efforts were made to complete a Client Participation Summary form approximately 9 to 15 months after the baseline interview.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Responses to questions from the RF4 and RF5 surveys can be compared to responses from the RB3 to identify changes between two points in time. The common variable names were copied from RB3 when possible and prefixed by a capital \"F\" to indicate \"Follow-Up\". For variables not common with RB3, the variable naming convention is \"F + sectionletter + other identifying characters\".;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Most, but not all records, contain post-intervention process and attrition data captured by the Client Participation Summary (CPS/CP2) forms. The majority of records (24,409) have both CPS variables and CP2 variables. The CPS variables are urine test and follow-up HIV test results, reason lost to follow-up, presence of needle tracks, referrals, and number and length of intervention sessions. The CP2 variables include all of the CPS variables plus detailed intervention process information, number and length of enhanced intervention sessions, and unscheduled session participation. There were 3,807 records with only the CPS variables and 2,872 records missing both CPS and CP2 variables.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Specific instruments were used to collect HIV test results at baseline (BHT3), three-month follow-up (FHT33), and 6-month follow-up (FHT36).
