Inmate interviews lasted an average of an hour, with a book of stamps provided as compensation. There were two interviewers at each session, one asking closed and open-ended questions and the other typing responses to open-ended questions. Upon completion of the interview, inmates were asked to provide contact information for the family member(s) identified as focal family. While inmates were willing, and in most instances able to provide at least an address and/or phone number for their families, making contact with family members proved difficult. In some instances, a phone number had been disconnected or an inmate was able to provide an address, but no phone number. In these cases, a general letter asking the family to contact the principal investigator was sent, but specific information about the nature of the study could not be included because of confidentiality requirements.

Other variables ask about the inmate's contributions to the family prior to incarceration (income, emotional support, help with children) and hardships the family might be experiencing due to the incarceration (loss of income, had to move, problem with childrens' behavior). The data in Part 1 also include variables about programs the inmate might have completed while incarcerated, prospects for parole, and any help the inmate received from family members while incarcerated. Part 2 also includes variables on any social support the family may have received and if the family member was aware of the inmate's criminal activity prior to incarceration.

A random sample of 100 inmates was chosen from each institution by selecting the nth inmate from an alphabetical roster. The prison's visiting cards were reviewed for each of the inmates randomly selected to determine whether a visit had been received in the six-month period before May 31, 2005. Inmates in special units of the prison, such as the gang unit, administrative segregation, and the psychiatric stabilization unit, were excluded because conducting interviews with these inmates was considered a security risk, and their access to outside visits was modified or restricted. A dual sampling strategy for identifying potential family members was ultimately used. In addition to obtaining contact information for family members from the interviewed inmates, the principal investigator spent time at one of the prisons on Saturday mornings outside of the prison and in the area where families waited for visits. After approaching family members and explaining the purpose of the study, contact information for the families was collected with the name of the inmate they were visiting. The university Institutional Review Board required that inmates be interviewed and give permission for their family member to consider participation."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"face-to-face interview"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"none"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A total of 35 (25 from one prison and 10 from the other) inmates and 15 family members were interviewed, comprising 13 inmate and family dyads, 1 inmate and family triad, and an additional 21 inmate interviews.
