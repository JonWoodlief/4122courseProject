Respondents were asked if they were registered to vote in the state of Virginia, how certain they were that they would vote in the upcoming election for governor, how closely they were following the governor's race in Virginia, whether they would vote for the Republican candidate Mark Earley, the Democratic candidate Mark Warner, or the Libertarian candidate William Redpath, and if they were strong supporters of and had a favorable impression of any of the candidates. Those queried were asked if they approved of the way Governor Jim Gilmore was handling his job, whether they wanted a governor who could get the state going in a new direction or a governor who would keep the state moving in the same direction, how much they knew about Mark Earley and Mark Warner, whether the two candidates were conducting positive campaigns, and whether the respondent thought either candidate would raise taxes if elected. In regards to Mark Earley and Mark Warner, respondents were asked if they agreed that either candidate had the right qualifications to be governor, would work to hold taxes down, would look out for the interests of people like the respondent, would strengthen the state's economy, would say anything to get elected, would improve transportation and roads, would work effectively with the legislature to get a state budget passed, and would make sure Virginia was prepared to deal with any terrorist threats. In addition, respondents were asked how important the following issues were in voting for governor: fully eliminating the car tax, holding down taxes generally, improving transportation and roads, improving public education, strengthening the state's economy, handling the issue of gun control, and handling the abortion issue. Respondents were also asked if they favored or opposed allowing Northern Virginian voters to hold a tax referendum, whether it would cause a tax hike in the rest of the state if those voters voted to raise taxes, how respondents rated the Virginia economy, whether abortion in all cases should be legal, and if they were worried that a friend, relative, or they themselves would be the victim of a future terrorist attack.
