It was designed to advance the understanding of the  developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social  behaviors. In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways  of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and  violence. At the same time, the project provided a detailed look at  the environments in which these social behaviors took place by  collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including  its people, institutions, and resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal  Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>One component of the PHDCN was the  Longitudinal Cohort Study, which was a series of coordinated  longitudinal studies that followed over 6,000 randomly selected  children, adolescents, and young adults, and their primary caregivers  over time to examine the changing circumstances of their lives, as  well as the personal characteristics, that might lead them toward or  away from a variety of antisocial behaviors.

The project collapsed 847 census tracts in  the city of Chicago into 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon  seven groupings of racial/ethnic composition and three levels of  socioeconomic status. The NCs were designed to be ecologically  meaningful. They were composed of geographically contiguous census  tracts and geographic boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's  neighborhoods were considered in the definition of the NCs. Each NC  was comprised of approximately 8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal  Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a  stratified probability sample of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80  NCs were sampled from the 21 strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by  three socioeconomic levels) with the goal of representing the 21 cells  as equally as possible to eliminate the confounding between  racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic status. Once the 80 NCs were  chosen, then block groups were selected at random within each of the  sample neighborhoods. A complete listing of dwelling units was  collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant women, children, and  young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18  years) were identified through in-person screening of approximately  40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The screening response rate  was 80 percent. Children within six months of the birthday that  qualified them for the sample were selected for inclusion in the  Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347 participants were  identified through the screening. Of the eligible study participants,  6,228 were interviewed.</p>\n\n<p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18,  primary caregivers as well as the child were interviewed. The primary  caregiver was the person found to spend the most time taking care of  the child. Separate research assistants administered the primary  caregiver interviews and the child interviews. The primary method of  data collection was face-to-face interviewing, although participants  who refused to complete the personal interview were administered a  phone interview. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, English, and  Polish. In Wave 1 the complete protocol was translated into Spanish  and Polish. An interpreter was hired for participants who spoke a  language other than English, Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age  and wave of data collection, participants were paid between $5 and $20  per interview. Other incentives, such as free passes to museums, the  aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes were also included.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For  example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking  traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,  delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and  self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also  interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,  parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental  health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deviance of Peers</strong></p>\n\n<p>The full version of Deviance of  Peers was a 36-item self-report interview that obtained information  about peer involvement in conventional and delinquent activities and  was administered to participants in Cohorts 9 to 18.
