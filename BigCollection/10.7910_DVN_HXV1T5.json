The information generated was vital for the sales and marketing teams in prioritizing their efforts to place and distribute condoms and identify additional areas to focus communication efforts. The study took a census of existing formal, informal and high risk outlets rather than sampling a small portion of areas and extrapolating the results. All the small territorial units (enumeration areas: EAs) established during the national population census, which was conducted in the year 2007 by the National Statistics Office were considered as geographic areas in which outlets were audited. The assessment of coverage determined the proportion of outlets where condoms were available. In addition to providing a basic measure of product coverage, the assessment also determined quality of coverage, that is the proportion of outlets where condoms conform to additional minimum standards. Addition\nal information was collected on the frequency of stock outs, and willingness to stock and sell the products for outlets which never stocked the product. The data was collected in September 2009. A simple electronic audit sheet (Annex 2) on PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) was used to collect coverage and quality of coverage information and target population data in all the EAs. Coordinates of each venue were recorded with GPS (Global Positioning System) units and the data was managed in Arc Map. The data was further analyzed using SPSS. The resulting information was displayed through maps and tables that depict coverage, quality of coverage, access and penetration on formal, informal and high risk outlets for condoms in each of the four administrative regions of Swaziland."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"MAP"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"LQAS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HIV/AIDS"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Condoms"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Providers"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DUTCH"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SWAZILAND (2009): MAP STUDY EVALUATING THE AVAILABILITY OF CONDOMS IN THE FOUR REGIONS OF SWAZILAND.
