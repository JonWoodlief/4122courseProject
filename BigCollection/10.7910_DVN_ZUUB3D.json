We use the single-counter-example method, extracted from Classical Logic, to prove that it could not be the case that one of our existing models for the human psyche\r\ncould explain the human sleep. The models of the human psyche that we consider are the Freudian, the Jungian, and our own (Pinheiro, 2014a). By proving that no known part could be active whilst we sleep, and we prove all by presenting known facts, we reach the conclusion that we need a new model of psyche to account for the entire complexity of our beings. We associate sleep with dreams. Upon discussing the human dreams in more details, we end up applying the principles of the inference to the best explanation to explain the human dreams by means of references to the spiritual world. That makes us think about how the spiritists would describe our psyche, and we then present a new model. The new model is obviously a fruit of speculation.\r\nThis time, the model involves all Freudian elements, our extensional elements, body,\r\nand soul. We use the synthetic method to construct our new model. Since our sleep time is so important, to the point of obliging us to build a new model for the human psyche, we worry about protecting it. We then use studies on the impact of noise on humans to talk about how bad the consequences of having a person speaking to us during sleep are. This trivially extends to people that are in hypnotic state. We try to make a case against hypnosis and interference with the sleep of human beings by referring to health, spiritual, and world consequences. Our main result is then a new model for the human psyche, and this time a model that has to do with what is beyond what has already been formally acknowledged by us.\r\nA secondary result is that we should not allow people to hypnotize others or to speak\r\nto them as they sleep. Our conclusions are that there is definitely something beyond our rationality that happens during our sleep time and this something has not been identified by Freud, Jung or us this far. Besides, that we should not allow people to hypnotize others or speak to them as they sleep."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-11"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"United States"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"3"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1/2015"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"dissertation"}]}},"files":[{"description":"January-April 2015 Issue (Vol 3, No 1/2015)","label":"ANIMA EST","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":88799,"dataFile":{"id":2917448,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/ZUUB3D/QWFFFF","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZUUB3D/QWFFFF","filename":"ANIMA EST","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1001944,"description":"January-April 2015 Issue (Vol 3, No 1/2015)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1585497bfef-a179967f910c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a139a58020df3fe354831c92288684b2","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a139a58020df3fe354831c92288684b2"}}}]}}}
