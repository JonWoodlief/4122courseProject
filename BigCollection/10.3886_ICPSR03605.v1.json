Implementation of a  redesigned NHIS, consisting of a basic module, a periodic module, and  a topical module, began in 1997 (See NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY,  1997 [ICPSR 2954]). The 2001 NHIS contains the Household, Family,  Person, Sample Adult, Sample Child, Child Immunization, and Injury and  Poison Episode data files from the basic module. Each record in the  Household-Level File (Part 1) contains data on type of living  quarters, number of families in the household responding and not  responding, and the month and year of the interview for each sampling  unit. The Family-Level File (Part 2) is made up of reconstructed  variables from the person-level data of the basic module and includes  information on sex, age, race, marital status, Hispanic origin,  education, veteran status, family income, family size, major  activities, health status, activity limits, and employment status,  along with industry and occupation. As part of the basic module, the  Person-Level File (Part 3) provides information on all family members  with respect to health status, limitation of daily activities,  cognitive impairment, and health conditions. Also included are data on  years at current residence, region v\nariables, height, weight, bed  days, doctor visits, hospital stays, and health care access and  utilization. A randomly-selected adult in each family was interviewed  for the Sample Adult File (Part 4) regarding respiratory conditions,  renal conditions, AIDS, joint symptoms, health status, limitation of  daily activities, and behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption,  and physical activity. Also included in this file are variables  pertaining to the Healthy People 2010 Objectives. The Sample Child  File (Part 5) provides information from an adult in the household on  medical conditions of one child in the household, such as respiratory  problems, seizures, allergies, and use of special equipment such as  hearing aids, braces, or wheelchairs. Also included are variables  regarding child behavior, the use of mental health services, and  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The Child  Immunization File (Part 6) presents information from shot records and  supplies vaccination status, along with the number and dates of shots,  and information about the chicken pox vaccine. Episode-based  information regarding injuries and poisonings are found in the Injury  and Poison Episode File (Part 7), which examines the cause and date of  injury or poisoning, loss of time from work or school, and whether the  episode resulted in hospitalization. Information in the Injury and  Poison Verbatim File (Part 8) is comprised of narrative text  describing injuries, including type of injury, how the injury occurred, and the body part injured."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disabilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"doctor visits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hospitalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"immunization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"illness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"injuries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
