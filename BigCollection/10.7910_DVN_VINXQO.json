The data are based on an Alan Guttmacher Institute survey of 1,241 young women seeking contraceptive services from 53 family planning clinics and another 1,170 seeking abortion services. The present data set contains data only for the teenagers seeking contraceptive services. Data were collected during the period of October, 1979 to March, 1980.  Each respondent was asked whether or not her parents knew about her clinic visit for contraceptive services and, if her parents did not know, what ahe would have done (with respect to contraceptive and aexual behavior, and utilization of clinic services) if their notification had been required by the clinic. The study was also designed to determine what proportion of teenagers whose parents knew they were getting birth control services had told them voluntarily, what propor\ntion had told them because the clinic required them to do so, and whether or not the teenager talked about ways of preventing pregnancy with their parents. The survey asked each respondent if she had ever used the pill, IUD, or diaphragm and what birth control method she intended to obtain from the clinic. The 30 respondents who chose nonprescription methods are not included in this dataset. Finally, the women were asked with whom they lived: teenagers who did not answer that they were living with their husbands were assumed to be unmarried."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1984"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health Statistics"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Social Indicators"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Version Date: 1984Version Text: 1st DAAPPP ed.
