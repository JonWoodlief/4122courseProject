Beginning in 2000, though, firms began to  curtail these expenditures. By 2001, high-tech and other forms of  business investment were falling sharply. Indeed, much of the downturn  in the growth of United States economic activity can be traced to the  sharp decline in investment spending. Several explanations have been  offered, from the acceleration in labor productivity -- the so-called  \"New Economy\" story -- to the stock market surge and subsequent  collapse. One explanation that has not been explored in much detail\nis  the surge in business purchases of hardware and software in  preparation for the century data change (Y2K). Because many  information processing systems and much of the hardware and software  were not Y2K-compliant as late as 1998, it was thought that business  investment in high-tech equipment and software would increase  appreciably to fix this problem. Although solid Y2K spending data are  lacking, the evidence presented in this paper indicates that the  magnitude and timing of Y2K-related expenditures make it unlikely that the investment boom and bust was a Y2K event."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"business expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic growth"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"high tech industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information technology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"technology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"technological change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
