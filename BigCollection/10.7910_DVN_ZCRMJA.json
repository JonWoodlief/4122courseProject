Causes of death are coded using the eighth and ninth revisions of The International Classification of Diseases. The Mortality Detail File data is the source file used by the NCHS for the data reported annually in the Vital Statistics of the United States, Vol.II - Mortality.\nThe original data files were collected and prepared by the National Center for Health Statistics and distributed by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. Over the years, the number and location of variables and file formats of the original machine-readable data files changed. The SSDC data collection files have been reformatted by Dr. David Phillips and Todd E. Ruth, Department of Sociology, University of California, San Diego so that variable locations and file\nformats are standardized for all years of data."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/ssdc/icp07632.html"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Washington, DC: U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1994"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-07-18"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-07-15"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1968"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1997"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Documentation + Data files (7)"]},{"typeName":"relatedMaterial","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/ssdc/browse/icp07632.cdbk.html"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["All deaths in the United States"]}]}},"files":[]}}}
