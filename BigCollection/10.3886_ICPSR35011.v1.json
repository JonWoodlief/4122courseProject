Information was supplied by 333 respondents about their organization's domestic and international sourcing costs. Variables in this data collection include the organizations employee's benefits (such as the retirement benefits, health benefits, and wage) and the organization's expenditure for eight business functions: (1) the primary function, (2) research and development of products, services or technology, (3) sales and marketing, (4) transportation, logistics, and distribution services, (5) customer and after-sales service, (6) management, administration, and back office functions, (7) information technology systems, and (8) facilities maintenance. The sourcing costs were either incurred domestically in-house, externally from domestic suppliers, from international affiliates, or externally from international suppliers. For companies engaged in international sourcing, information about the type of international location was identified as (1) industrialized country locations with costs the same or higher than the United States, (2) emerging country locations with costs somewhat lower than the United States, and (3) developing country locations with costs much lower than the United States. United States employment and wages (according to four ranges) were also collected by business function.
