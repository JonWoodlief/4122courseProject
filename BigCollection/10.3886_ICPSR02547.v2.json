Respondents were asked for their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, as well as their views on First Lady Hillary Clinton and independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Those queried were also asked to comment on the confidentiality of discussions between the president and White House aides, the importance to the nation of the allegations about Clinton's sexual misconduct, Clinton's guilt or innocence regarding the allegations of sexual harassment made by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones, the concept of \"executive privilege,\" and Starr's investigations into Whitewater and the alleged affair between former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the president. A series of questions addressed the reliability of physical evidence, eyewitness testimony, and DNA testing at a trial. An additional subject covered the assa\nssination of President John F. Kennedy, including Lee Harvey Oswald's responsibility, the evidence against Oswald, the possibility of an official cover-up, and whether the whole story would ever be told. Respondents were also asked how frequently they utilized computers and electronic mail and whether they were willing to participate in an on-line poll. Background information on respondents includes age, race, ethnicity, sex, education, marital status, religion, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, family income, age of children in household, and stock market investments."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
