Each of the three scales is comprised of smaller scales. At the end of each small, indidividual scale a mean scale score was calculated. Some of the individual variables within a scale were reverse coded as part of the calculation. The question text for the me\nan scale score variables includes the designation \"(R)\" for those items that were reverse coded. However, the individual variables themselves have not been reverse coded.</p>;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>Both waves use the same CEST and BOP scales.

However, it was not included as part of the survey administration for most of the cases from the TCU center during Wave 1.
