In schools with more than 350 students in the grade, a random sample of students or classes was drawn. In schools with less than 350 students in a grade, all students were asked to participate. Each school was asked to participate for two years so that each year one-half of the sample would be replaced. Schools refusing participation were replaced with similar schools in terms of geographic location, size, and type of school (e.g., public, private/Catholic, private/non-Catholic). For the 8th-grade survey, schools with less than 20 8th graders were excluded from the sample. For the 10th-grade survey, schools with less than 25 10th graders were excluded.
