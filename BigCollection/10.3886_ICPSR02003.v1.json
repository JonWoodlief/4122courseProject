Views were gathered on the 1996   presidential and congressional elections, as well as on President   Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, the economy, and   foreign affairs. Respondents were polled on whether they were better   or worse off financially compared to three years ago, whether it was   more important to cut federal taxes or balance the federal budget,   and whether they supported middle class tax cuts, even if it meant   cutting spending on federal programs. Questions involving the   upcoming presidential election polled respondents on the likelihood   that they would vote, whom they would vote for (President Bill   Clinton, Republican Bob Dole, or Reform Party candidate Ross Perot),   whether each candidate had the qualities needed to be an effective   president, the success of their political campaigns, and who the   Republican vice-presidential candidate should be. Opinions were   solicited on whether the presidential candidates had a vision for the   future of the country, had high moral and ethical standards, cared   about people like the respondent, had new ideas, and stood up for   what they believed in, and which one would do a better job handling   issues such as the economy, crime, the environment, and Medicare.   Respondents were queried on whether they would vote for a Democratic   or Republican candidate in the upcoming United States House of   Representatives election, whether they approved of the way the United   States Congress was doing its job, and whether Pat Buchanan should be   allowed to make a speech at the Republican convention. Respondents   were also asked which political party best represented their ideal of   how the United States should be governed, whether the views of each   party were too conservative or too liberal, whether respondents   supported Ross Perot's new Reform Party, and whether the country   needed a new political party. Views were also elicited on issues such   as a federal balanced budget amendment, the death penalty,   congressional term limits, gun control, organized prayer in public   schools, a flat-tax system, recent changes to the welfare system,   affirmative action, gay rights, and whether respondents would prefer   a smaller government with fewer services or a larger government with   many services. Several questions addressed whether abortion should be   legal, whether the Republican vice-presidential candidate should   support legal abortion, and whether the Republican platform should   support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. Other topics   address\ned respondents' level of confidence in the United States   government to prevent future terrorist attacks, how worried they were   about the possibility of major terrorist attacks in the United   States, and whether the government should mount a war against   terrorism, even if it cost billions of dollars and intruded on   personal freedoms. Background variables include sex, age, ethnicity,   marital status, employment status, education, religion, household   income, social class, subjective size of community, labor union   membership, political orientation, political party affiliation, and  voter registration and participation
