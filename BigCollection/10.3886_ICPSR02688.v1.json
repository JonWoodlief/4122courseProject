This study  compares a sample from each group -- uninsured and individually  insured -- meeting the same minimum household income definition of at  least 200 percent above the federal poverty level. Telephone  interviews were conducted with 1,009 nonpoor uninsured individuals  between the ages of 19 and 64 regarding current utilization of and  expenditures for medical care, satisfaction with current sources of  care, attitudes toward health insurance, perception of the cost of  health insurance, willingness to pay, experiences with health  insurance, and reasons for not purchasing health insurance. Interviews  were also conducted with 802 individuals between the ages of 19 and 64  who had purchased individual (nongroup) health insurance. The  questionnaire for the insured group was identical to the questionnaire  for the uninsured group, with two exceptions: it did not include  perceptions of the cost of health insurance or willingness to pay, and  added questions regarding type and cost of health insurance purchased.  In all, 1,811 interviews were conducted: 1,782 in English and 29 in  Spanish. Demographic variables for both groups include age, gender, employment, and education."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
