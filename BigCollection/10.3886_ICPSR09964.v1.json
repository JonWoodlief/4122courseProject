Three  Reception Guidance Centers (RGC) provided intake functions for  California Youth Authority (CYA) wards committed by the courts to the  agency for custody and care. The RGC at the Deuel Vocational  Institution (DVI) in Tracy, California, processed the oldest group of  CYA wards during this time, and the original data used in this  research were generated and collected there. Original data were  collected on 4,146 offenders in 1964 and 1965. The young adult  offenders committed to the RGC-DVI spent six weeks at the center for  diagnosis and assessment. During this time they were tested  individually and in groups, interviewed by case workers, given medical  and dental examinations, and approximately 1 in 10 was examined by a  psychiatrist or a psychologist. The information generated during this  assessment phase was systematically collected for research purposes by  the clinical staff. A variety of psychological instruments were used  in this process, some administere\nd by the CYA or other government  agencies as part of routine processing, others administered by the  researcher. Each weekly intake group spent the first complete week in  testing. The testing program started every Friday with an orientation  of the group and some diagnostic tests to determine the level of the  California Achievement Test Battery (CATB) to be given each  individual. The standard tests were administered beginning on the  following Monday. The General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) was  administered by test proctors from the United States Department of  Labor, who made vocational counseling available after the testing.  From each weekly group, 40 individuals were selected for one week of  in-depth testing and observation in a vocational shop setting. Twenty  individuals were assigned to the metal shop and 20 to the wood  shop. Shop instructors evaluated subjects for training potential and  motivation for training. The Army General Classification Test (AGCT)  was administered only to the individuals in the intermediate and  advanced category of the CATB testing. The Revised Beta Test was  administered to individuals suspected of defective or borderline  defective intelligence. For those who met a minimum reading  achievement test, the researcher administered the Composite Opinion  and Attitude Survey (COAS) instrument. This was done to explore in  depth the various psychological characteristics of the offenders. The  COAS is a combination of three other psychological instruments: the  California Psychological Inventory, the Minnesota Multiphasic  Personality Inventory, and the Inventory of Personal Opinions. Over  approximately the next 20 years, arrest records were collected for the  individuals in the original samples. Arrest histories, from the  California Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, are  available for 3,652 of the original 4,146 individuals. A total of 54,175 arrest records are available."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"At the time of admittance to the California Youth  Authority, data were collected on arrest history, including current  offenses, drug and alcohol use, psychological and personality  variables, and sentencing, and demographics such as age, education,  work experience, and family structure.
