Opinions were sought on how well George W. Bush was handling the presidency, whether things in the country were on the right track, respondents' rating of the condition of the economy, and whether they thought the economy was getting better or worse. Respondents were asked their opinions of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Michelle Obama. Several questions also addressed the Obama Administration including how confident respondents were in Barack Obama's ability to make the right decisions regarding the country, whether respondents felt optimistic about the next four years with Barack Obama as president, and whether respondents approved of Obama's cabinet selections and his nomination of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Respondents were asked their opinions about how well things were going for the United States' efforts to restore order to Iraq, how well they thought the war in Afghanistan was going for the United States, and the likelihood that there would be another terrorist attack in the United States within a few months. Other questions addressed whether respondents approved of the federal government providing financial assistance to banks and other financial institutions, the big three auto makers, and homeowners in attempts to improve the economy. Respondents were also asked whether the government should have a say on how the auto companies are managed, whether the government should require the auto makers to build more cars that use alternative fuels if they received financial aid, and whether or not the auto makers going out of business would have a major impact on the nation's economy. Other topics included the housing market, the job market, job security, and respondents' personal finances. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, education level, marital status, political party affiliation, political philosophy, household income, voter registration status and participation history, and religious preference."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Afghanistan
