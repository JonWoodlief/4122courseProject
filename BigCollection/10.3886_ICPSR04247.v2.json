Information on feelings about various parenting activities was also ascertained.</p>\n\n<p>Using established time-diary procedures with Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI), respondents were asked to complete \"yesterday\" time diaries. These diaries detailed respondents' primary activities from midnight to midnight of the previous day, their secondary activities (e.g., activities that occurred simultaneously with the primary activities), and when, with whom, and where they engaged in the activities. In addition to estimates of time use, the project elicited information on (1) age, race/ethnicity, family income, marital status, education, and employment status of the respondent and spouse (if married), (2) weekly estimates of time spent in different activities with children, (3) feelings of time pressure, and (4) enjoyment of certain parenting activities.</p>\n\n<p>There are two different data files available. Part 1, Main Data, contains 1,200 respondent records that include respondent and household characteristics, questions about feelings and time pressure, and survey weights. This file also contains aggregated measures of minutes per day in 99 detailed primary time activities, time spent in 13 locations, and time spent with different categories of people. The Main Data Codebook documents the variables contained in Part 1.</p>\n\n<p>Part 2, Time Diary Data, contains 24,814 activity records collected in the time diary.
