Other  areas of investigation included crime displacement, \"free-rider\"  effects (i.e., crimes occurring in conjunction with other crimes), and  a multilevel analysis of victimization risks. Two types of data were  gathered for this collection. First, census tract data were used to  identify tracts that had not changed their physical boundaries since  1960. In addition, statistics were gathered from police reports for  the same years. Variables for the census tract data (Part 1) include  median family income in constant 1980 dollars, average number of  persons per occupied housing unit, percent of labor force taking  public transportation to work, percent of children under 18 living  with both parents, and percent of civilian labor force that was  female. Police report variables in Part 1 include rates per 100,000  population for homicide, rape, robbery, assault, residential burglary,  and automobile theft. Secondly, during a telephone survey of Seattle  residents conducted in 1990, respondents were asked a variety of  questions about their experiences with crime and victimization. These  data, presented in Part 2, cover burglaries, stolen property, physical  assaults by strangers, vandalism, car thefts, type of neighborhood,  type of home, security measures taken, and sociodemographic  conditions. The unit of analysis for this data collection is housing units."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen participation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen patrols"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime control"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminality"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhoods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victimization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
