It is recommended that  researchers download the Drug Characteristics file, updated annually,  from the Ambulatory Health Care Data Web site. The characteristics  from this file can be applied by matching on drug codes to previous  years of data in order to get the most accurate results when doing  analysis of drug trends by therapeutic class. It is also recommended  that users use the SAS program (that can be adapted for use with other  software), which the National Center for Health Statistics developed  and which is downloadable from their  NAMCS Web site\n<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/namcs.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/namcs.htm</a>\n. This  program will apply the new characteristics from the most curr\nent  version of the drug database to previous years of data.
