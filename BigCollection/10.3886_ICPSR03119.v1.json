This data collection focused on the presidential election that  took place on November 7, 2000. The poll queried respondents about the  situation in the country 26 days after the election. Respondents  expressed their opinions about the post-election situation in the  country, the legitimacy of this election, their confidence in the  accuracy of Florida's recount, and whom they wanted to see become the  next president. Additional questions elicited views on the way Vice  President Al Gore's and Texas governor George W. Bush's campaigns were  handling the election situation and what impact the unclear  post-election situation could have on the country's system of  presidential elections. A group of questions concentrated on the hand  recounts: whether there should be hand recounts of all the votes in  Florida and wh\nether the hand recounts in two counties that did not  complete them on Gore's request should be completed and counted in the  final vote total. Those polled also expressed their views about  whether, after the Florida Secretary of State had declared George W. Bush the  winner, Al Gore should concede or if he should ask the courts to  review the vote. Other questions examined respondents' opinions about  whether the United States Supreme Court, the Florida state  legislature, and the United States Congress should be involved in  determining the winner of the election in Florida, as well as if the  United States Supreme Court's ruling in this case would be fair for  both sides. The survey also collected respondents' opinions about  whether they wanted to end the unclear situation quickly or give both  campaigns a chance to make their full case in court. Background  information on respondents includes age, gender, education, race, party affiliation, political orientation, and voter registration."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
