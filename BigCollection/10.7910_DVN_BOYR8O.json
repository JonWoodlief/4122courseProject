We examined the effects of market income inequality (income inequality\r\nbefore taxes and transfers) and income redistribution via taxes and transfers on inequality\r\nin longevity.\r\nMethods.Weused life tables to compute Gini coefficients of longevity inequality for all\r\nindividuals and for individuals who survived to at least 10 years of age. We regressed\r\nlongevity inequality on market income inequality and income redistribution, and we\r\ncontrolled for potential confounders, in a cross-sectional time-series sample of up to 28\r\npredominantly Western developed countries and up to 37 years (1974–2011).\r\nResults. Income inequality before taxes and transfers was positively associated with\r\ninequality in the number of years lived; income redistribution (the difference between\r\nmarket income inequality and income inequality after taxes and transfers were accounted\r\nfor) was negatively associated with longevity inequality.\r\nConclusions.To the extent that our estimated effects derived from observational data\r\nare causal, governments can reduce longevity inequality not only via public health\r\npolicies, but also via their influence on market income inequality and the redistribution of\r\nincomes from the relatively rich to the relatively poor.
