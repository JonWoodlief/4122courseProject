The   objective of the study was to provide descriptions of these firms, with   equivalent representation of all eight industry sectors within   Pennsylvania's ten local development districts. Respondents chosen from   the firms were people who had helped start the firms and who were still   active in the management of the firms at the time of the survey.   Respondents were asked to measure their satisfaction with labor costs,   access to customers and suppliers, energy costs, and reliability of the   energy source by rating these issues on an importance scale. Other   items addressed the firms' products and markets, finan\ncial situations,   management and organizational structures, and locations. These topics   were assessed for the individual company both in terms of initial   status and current status. Respondents were asked to comment on the   current management focus, and to gauge the importance of lower prices,   better service, quality of products or services, advertising, and   location. Respondents also provided sales, export, and asset histories,  some going back to before 1977."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
