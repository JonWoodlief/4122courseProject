Thereby, the geographic scales of the patterns are varied, and possible scale differences are combined with each other. This has been done for 90 configurations, whereby random sampling (geometry as well as attributes) was done 100 times for each pattern configuration. Overall, 9.000 patterns are contained.\r\n\r\nThe datasets contained in the uploaded ZIP file are organized into four folders:\r\noverlap_lws_non_rev, overlap_lws_rev, overlap_swl_non_rev and overlap_swl_rev.\r\nTherebey, swl is acronym to \"small with large,\" while lws stands for \"large with small\" respectively. The reason for this denominator scheme is that, in case of lws, 23.8% of the points from the larger-scale sub-pattern interact with at least one point from the smaller-scale counterpart. With swl the same has been done, but vice versa. When the the scale differences become too large, the ratio of 23.8% is no longer achievable (for purely geometric reasons). In these cases, a closest fit solution has been seeked instead. The suffix \"non_rev\" meant that the attribute values were dispersed in a way such that the values increase from center towards pattern boundary. \"rev\" refers to a reversed attribute dispersal mechanism.\r\n\r\nEach single CSV file follows the following naming scheme: clust_rep_min_max.\r\n\"rep\" thereby refers to the repetition (1 - 100), \"min\" denotes the minimum distance (m) at which any point within the larger-scale pattern interacts, \"max\" refers to the maximum point spacing distance accordingly. Note that the scale of the small-scale pattern has been fixed to [1,10], only the scale of the large scale-pattern was varied.\r\n\r\nWithin these files, the following columns are contained:\r\nThe first column (no title) contains unique row IDs.\r\nThe second column (\"V1\") contains the X-part of the geographic coordinates.\r\nThe third column (\"V2\") contains the Y-part of the geographic coordinates.\r\nThe fourth column (\"V3\") contains an integer describing the association to one of the two contained sub-patterns. 0 thereby means \"small-scale,\" while any other number indicates association to the large-scale pattern.\r\nThe fifth column (\"vals\") contains Gaussian random values. The values for the small-scale pattern have been drawn from N(250,150) while the values for the large-scale pattern have been drawn from N(750,150).\r\nThe sixth and last column (\"lag\") contains the spatial lag of each observation. Thereby, the lag is adjusted to neighborhoods according to the larger-scale pattern (i.e., cut-off distance of \"max\"). The employed spatial weights were generated by an inverse distance weighting scheme."},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Westerholt, Rene"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"GIScience Research Group, Heidelberg University"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/personen/gis_westerholt_en.html"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-17"},{"typeName":"productionPlace","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Heidelberg"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Westerholt, Rene"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"GIScience Research Group, Heidelberg University"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/personen/gis_westerholt_en.html"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-18"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Westerholt, Rene"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-03-18"},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Point Pattern"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"overlapping_patterns.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":80168,"dataFile":{"id":2793184,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/GNU8F1/TDQLNY","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GNU8F1/TDQLNY","filename":"overlapping_patterns.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":1259516599,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15388f740cb-873b4804fd61","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d98083bd7f5b918166fe0e4f8c87cf55","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d98083bd7f5b918166fe0e4f8c87cf55"}}}]}}}
