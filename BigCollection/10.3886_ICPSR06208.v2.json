Questions assessed Bill Clinton's presidency with regard to his handling of the economy and foreign policy, the strength of his leadership qualities, the fairness and potential impact of his economic plan, health care reform, and the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Additional questions concerned Congress, the national economy, reducing the federal budget deficit, Hillary Clinton's chairing of the Health Care Reform Commission, using the United States Air Force to bomb Serbian positions to protect humanitarian aid shipments to the Bosnians, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Bob Dole, Ross Perot, and the Republican attack on Clinton's deficit reduction plan. The call-back portion of the survey focused on opinion regarding Clinton's address concerning his de\nficit reduction plan.
