Public Use Tape (PUT) 24 is the third release of data   from the Health Insurance Plans Survey (HIPS). The HIPS is a follow-up   to the NMES Household Survey and was designed to verify health   insurance status reported by respondents to two components of the NMES,   the Household Survey and the Survey of American Indians and Alaska   Natives (SAIAN), as well as to provide supplementary information on   private health insurance premiums and benefit provisions from   employers, unions, and insurers through which coverage was provided.   With PUT 24 the user can make person- and family-level estimates of the   health insurance status of the entire civilian noninstitutionalized   U.S. population at the end of 1987. Tape 24 contains three data files.   File 1 contains data for persons in the NMES Household Survey. It   includes the policyholders identified on Public Use Tape 15, NATIONAL   MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY, 1987: POLICYHOLDERS OF PRIVATE INSURANCE:   PREMIUMS, PAYMENT SOURCES, AND TYPES AND SOURCE OF COVERAGE [PUBLIC USE   TAPE 15] (ICPSR 9901), and their dependents, as well as persons without\ninsurance and those with only public insurance. In addition, Tape 24   contains link files (Files 2 and 3) that enumerate each source of   private insurance for each privately insured person in the HIPS. File 2   contains the linkages of all eligible policyholders and covered   dependents with health insurance obtained from employers or unions, and   File 3 contains the linkages of all eligible policyholders and covered   dependents with health insurance obtained directly from insurance   carriers or associations. These linkages identify the persons covered   by each policyholder or all of the private insurance covering each   person (whether obtained as a policyholder or dependent). The link   files also identify the records in NATIONAL MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY,   1987: HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS SURVEY DATA, PRIVATE INSURANCE BENEFIT   DATABASE AND LINKAGES TO HOUSEHOLD SURVEY POLICYHOLDERS [PUBLIC USE   TAPE 16] (ICPSR 6168) associated with each source of coverage, allowing   the user direct access to the Private Insurance Benefit Database in PUT   16 in order to characterize the provisions of the insurance covering   each person (sometimes through multiple sources). The three data files   on Tape 24 can also be linked to all tapes from the Household Survey  with the person identifier PIDX."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alaskan Natives"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance policies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Native Americans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"payment methods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"private health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
