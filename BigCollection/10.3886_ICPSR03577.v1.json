The census was ordered by Duke Victor Amadeus II as  the city prepared for a siege from part of the French army, as ordered  by King Louis XIV. A house-by-house survey of all inhabitants was  conducted to assess how many men were able to bear arms and how many  people there were to feed. All of the inhabitants, including both  citizens and immigrants streaming into the city from the surrounding  countryside to escape the invaders, were listed by name, along with  their ages, family relationships, birthplaces, occupations, dwelling  places, and any weapons kept in the household. Fifty cantonieri  (ward-captains) were assigned to survey the 122 isole (city  blocks). The information for 15 of the isole are absent.
