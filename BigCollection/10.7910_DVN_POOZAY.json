The enumeration procedures differed by area.The procedure in white urban areas was as follows: Prior to the night of the census, every enumerator whose ESD fell within the limits of any municipality or other urban are, delivered the applicable questionnaires to every dwelling in the ESD. Thus for part of the country the 1970 Census was conducted by way of distributing census questionnaires beforehand and collecting the completed returns after the census day. In cases where the enumerator was requested to, as well as where the respondent was unable to complete the questionnaire, the census enumerator assisted in the completion thereof.\r\n In white non-urban areas, questionnaires were not distributed before census day except to hotels. On census day the enumerator had to hand the questionnaires to the householder for immediate return.\r\n In black residential areas, enumerators carried out a comprehensive door-to-door survey.\r\nThe particulars of all persons were entered on the appropriate questionnaire. Particulars were filled out by the enumerator except where the respondent indicated that s(he) wanted to fill out the questionnaire him(herself). Questionnaires were not distributed before census day.\r\n Every household was enumerated on a separate questionnaire.\r\n For the purpose of the 1970 census urban area was defined as areas with some form of local authority.
