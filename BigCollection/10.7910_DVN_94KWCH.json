Most works in this debate suggest at least implicitly that the ability to use the motion confers some advantage on the minority party that it would not otherwise enjoy. Some of these works treat MTR’s\r primarily as dependent variables whose use is to be explained (Wolfe\nnsberger 1991,\r 2003; Roberts 2004). Consequently, they are heavy on analysis of the minority’s ability\r to offer (successful) recommital motions; for the most part, however, they imply that the\r ability to offer MTR’s benefits the minority party, without spelling out the nature of the\r benefit. Krehbiel and Meirowitz (2003) are an exception, arguing explicitly that the\r benefit that the minority party gains via MTR’s is the ability to exert significant influence\r upon the shape of legislative d\necisions.<br /><br />\r To the extent that these studies of the motion’s significance find that it weakens\r the majority party, they rely largely on theoretical arguments and anecdotal evidence to\r back up their claims. We examine various data in a more rigorous empirical evaluation\r than has heretofore been conducted of hypotheses following from the view that the MTR\r empowers the minority party to affect policy.1 We show that these predictions are at sharp odds with observed behavior, suggestin\ng that the MTR does not undermine the\r majority party as has been argued."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gary W.
