The community surveys included questions about police effectiveness, police professionalism, neighborhood problems, and victimization.

Calling was done through the Schaeffer Center's CATI system. The Schaeffer Center completed 458 telephone surveys with randomly-selected residents of Knoxville, Broward County, and Kettering. The brief surveys included questions on opinions of police effectiveness and professionalism. It also queried respondents about neighborhood crime and disorder problems and victimization.</p>\n\n<p>A total of 312 officer surveys (Part 2) were conducted in Knoxville, Broward County, and Kettering in the fall of 2008 and spring of 2009. The officer surveys had three parts: job satisfaction items, procedural knowledge items, and questions about the culture of integrity. The surveys were administered differently in participating sites. In Broward County, the surveys were web-based questionnaires that officers took online. In Kettering and Knoxville, the surveys were administered at roll call s\nessions for all shifts by project staff. For both modes of administration, officers completed the surveys anonymously.</p>\n\n<p>Brief telephone surveys were administered between December 2008 and March 2009 to persons who had a recent contact with the law enforcement officers in Dallas, Knoxville, Broward County, and Kettering. The voluntary contact surveys (Part 3) were completed by 804 individuals who voluntarily contacted the police department to report a crime while the involuntary contact surveys (Part 4) were completed by 761 adults who were stopped by police in any of the four jurisdictions. Surveys in all four jurisdictions were conducted using lists of persons who had had a recent law enforcement encounter supplied by the participating law enforcement agencies. The voluntary and involuntary contact surveys were conducted by RAND adjunct staff in all areas but Dallas. Due to the large number of respondents in Dallas, the telephone surveys were conducted by the Survey Center at George Mason University.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>Part 1 contains 55 variables including police effectiveness, police professionalism, neighborhood problems, and victimization variables.

The Kettering Ohio sample utilized directory assisted numbers since the geographic area of Kettering is much smaller than that of Knoxville or Broward County. The directory listed numbers, purchased from Survey Sampling, Inc. precisely pre-identified respondents who lived in Kettering. Calling was done through the Schaeffer Center's CATI system, which controlled the number of attempts and eliminated calls to each town until the 150 completion target was reached. Up to six attempts were made to contact a household before it was removed from the working sample. Any adult in the household who was contacted by the Schaefer Center's was considered an eligible respondent for the purpose of this survey. The original sample size for each city was 1,500. In Kettering, the target of 150 was reached after 1,277 of the initial 1,500 sample households were contacted. In Knoxville, the target of 150 was reached after contacting 2,898 households.
