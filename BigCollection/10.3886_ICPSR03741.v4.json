The study was conducted in part to assess respondents' opinions and concerns about the state of New York City under the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Residents of the city were asked to give their opinions of Mayor Bloomberg and his handling of education, crime, the budget, the economy, and overall quality of life issues in New York City, as well as their views on what issue(s) should garner the most attention.  Their opinions were also sought on New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein, including their satisfaction with the quality of public schools in the city.  A series of questions addressed Bloomberg's plan to balance the budget. Questions focused on respondents' views regarding the severity of the budget problems, the cuts in services and tax increases already made, and whether the fire and police departments should have been included in those cuts. Respondents' opinions were sought on the progress made by the Bloomberg administration in the following areas: improving neighborhood public schools, keeping New York City safe from crime, helping the city recover from the 2001 terrorist attacks, creating affordable housing, and balancing the city's budget. Those polled answered questions about their concern regarding another terrorist attack in New York City and whether the city would be prepared, the proposals for rebuilding at the World Trade Center site including their preferred plan, the speed of the redevelopment of the site, and whether Bloomberg or Governor George Pataki should have more influence. Respondents were asked whether their encounters with panhandlers bothered them, whether they had seen more homeless people and/or people using/selling drugs in recent months, whether the city seemed cleaner or dirtier than one year ago, and whether they approved of the new smoking law banning smoking in almost all bars and restaurants in New York City. Additional questions probed the seriousness of the following issues: affordability and availability of housing, noise, unemployment, and whether Blacks and Whites were treated fairly by the New York City Police Department. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, education, religion, marital status, employment status, Hispanic descent, race, use of tobacco products, crime victimization history, length of residence in New York City, borough of residence, household income, children in household and whether they were enrolled in public, private, or parochial school."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bloomberg, Michael"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"municipal services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public schools"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"schools"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"terrorist attacks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
