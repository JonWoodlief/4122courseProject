At first  glance, the trend appears to signal success brought about by two  decades of criminal justice policy improvement and domestic violence  resource enhancement. However, much work and scientific analysis  remain to be done. This study builds on the work of Dugan et  al. (1999, 2000) and Browne and Williams (1989) by examining, in  greater detail, the relationship between intimate partner homicide and  gender, race, criminal justice system response, and domestic violence  services.

Focusing on California  permitted the researchers to obtain reliable and standardized data for  a large number of counties featuring diversity in population, in rural  and urban characteristics, and with a variety of domestic violence  criminal justice responses and shelter resources. Homicide data were  gathered by the State of California Department of Justice, Criminal  Justice Statistics Center. These data provided detailed information on  homicides committed in California from 1987 to 2000, such as whether  the victim and offender were intimate partners, the county of the  homicide, whether the offenders and victi\nms were adults, and the race  and gender of victims and offenders. Data on domestic violence  resources were obtained from the Governor's Office of Criminal Justice  Planning, Domestic Violence Branch, in the form of detailed reports  from domestic violence shelters in the state. Because only recent data  (starting in 1997) were available in machine-readable format, the  researchers used the hardcopy reports from the individual  shelter-based service providers in the state. State records indicated  the number of years federal funding was provided to each community  organization. Based on these records, the researchers computed the  number of federally-funded shelter-based organizations in a given  county over time. Data on criminal justice responses at the county  level were gathered from the State of California Department of  Justice, Criminal Justice Statistics Center. Arrests for violation of  California penal code 273.5 were classified as domestic violence  arrests. Data were gathered on any convictions and incarceration that  followed an arrest for domestic violence. Incarcerations included  prison sentences, jail sentences, and sentences to probation that  included some jail time. The researchers disaggregated these criminal  justice system measures by race and gender. In order to account for  population differences and changes over time, rates were computed per 100,000 adults (age 18 and older)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include county name, whether the county  was rural or urban, year, and number of federally-funded shelters in  the county.
