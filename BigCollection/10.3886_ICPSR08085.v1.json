The collection provides a broad spectrum of  information on each student and covers areas such as ability,  socioeconomic status, home background, community environment,  ethnicity, significant others, current activity at time of survey,  educational attainment, school experiences, school performance, work  status, work performance and satisfaction, goal orientations, marriage  and the family, and military experience. Data collected in the  base-year (1972) focus on factors relating to the student's  personal/family background, education and work experiences, plans,  aspirations, attitudes, and opinions. The first follow-up, which was  conducted in 1973, offers information on the respondent's activity  state (education, work, etc.), socioeconomic status, work and  educational experience since leaving high school, future plans, and  expectations. The second follow-up (1974) probes respondents on  similar measures but is augmented by additional variables pertaining  to work and education. The third follow-up (1976) contains additional  items on graduate school application and entry, job supervision, sex  roles, sex and race biases, and a subjective rating of high school  experiences. The fourth follow-up (1979) offers data similar to the  other follow-ups but includes some variables that were modified to  elicit unique information. For the fifth follow-up, the sample members  averaged 32 years of age and had been out of high school for 14  years. In addition to covering the same subject areas as the previous  surveys, this follow-up includes additional questions on marital  history, divorce, child support, and economic relationships in modern  families. Part 1 of this collection contains base-year data as well as  data collected during four subsequent follow-ups undertaken in 1973,  1974, 1976, and 1979, while Part 12 contains fifth follow-up data for  1986. Part 2, the School File, contains information obtained from the  respondent's high school and also from high school counselors. Data  are available on school organization and enrollment, course offerings,  special services and programs, library and other resources, time  scheduling, and grading systems. Counselor information is supplied on  work loads, counseling practices and facilities, experience with  student financial aid programs, age, ethnicity, training, and  experience. A supplementary School District Census File, Part 3,  contains 1970 Census data tabulated by school district boundaries. In  addition, the collection includes an FICE Code File and a CEEB  Institutional Data Base File that can be used in conjunction with the  student file to supply contextual information about respondents'  colleges. The Institutional Data Base File offers data for colleges  and universities on\nitems such as enrollment, income and revenues,  expenses, tuition and fees, and median student scores on standardized  tests. Parts 6, 7, 9, and 10 contain transcript data from each  postsecondary institution reported by sample members in the first  through fourth follow-up surveys. Data are available for several types  of postsecondary institutions, ranging from short-term vocational or  occupational programs through major universities with graduate  programs and professional schools. Data in these four rectangular  files -- Student, Transcript, Term, and Course Files -- are organized  to be used in combination hierarchically. Information is available on  terms of attendance, fields of study, specific courses taken, and  grades and credits earned. The Fifth Follow-Up Teaching Supplement  (Parts 15-17) surveyed those members of the original 1972 sample who  had obtained teaching certificates and/or who had teaching  experience. Respondents were asked questions about their qualifications, experience, and attitudes toward teaching."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic achievement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career goals"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family background"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"high school graduates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"high school students"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life events"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marital status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work experience"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
