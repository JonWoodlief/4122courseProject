In order to standardize the responses, the questionnaire asked respondents about the relationship with their youngest child.<br /><br />  Data were collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire.\r\nThe questionnaire included sections on the parent's personal priorities, sex-role identification, personality traits, assessment of the parent-child relationship, and items regarding domestic responsibilities and child care.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds numeric file data for the single and married parents surveyed.
