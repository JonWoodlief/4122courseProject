This continuing series of monthly surveys solicit public opinion on the presidency and on a range of other political and social issues. The dataset includes their responses to call-back questions as well as to selected questions in the original poll (ICPSR 27803) which asked whether they approved of the way Barack Obama was handling the presidency, the war in Afghanistan, health care, and the economy. Several questions addressed health care, including whether respondents thought the health care system in the United States worked well, whether Medicare worked well, and whether the government would do a better job than private health care companies in keeping health care costs down and providing medical coverage. Respondents were also asked their opinions on whether President Obamaâ€™s proposals for reform would increase competition in the private insurance market, the health insurance industry, whether they believed in the possibility of expanding health care coverage without increasing budget deficits or taxes on the middle class, whether President Obama or the Republicans in Congress had better ideas about reforming the health care system, and whether they understood the health care reforms that Congress was considering. Whether President Obama's proposals for reform would increase competition in the private insurance market, whether the health care reform proposed by President Obama would make health care better in the United States and would help the respondent personally, and whether respondents favored the ideas of requiring all Americans to buy health insurance and the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan.  Information was collected on how respondents thought health care reforms under consideration in Congress would effect the middle class, senior citizens, small businesses, the respondent personally, their health care costs, and the quality of health care.  Additional topics that were covered included the pullout of troops from Iraq, credit card debt, how the federal government should use taxpayer's money, personal finances, the best way to discourage obesity,  terrorist attacks, the war in Afghanistan, the swine flu, and job security.  Respondents were re-interviewed on September 10, 2009, and asked whether they approved of the way Barak Obama was handling health care, if they had listened to the president's address of September 9th, the clarity of his\nexplanation in regard to reform, if they agreed with the proposed reforms, whether Congress would pass and President Obama would sign a bill reforming the system.  Questions in regard to budget deficit, expanded health care, regulation of the health insurance industry were also asked.   Demographic variables include sex, age, race, marital status, education level, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, perceived social class, religious preference, and voter registration status and participation
