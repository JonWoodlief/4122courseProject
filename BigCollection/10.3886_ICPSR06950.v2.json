Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions include age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, anabolic steroids, nonmedical use of prescription drugs including psychotherapeutics, and polysubstance use. Respondents were also asked about substance abuse treatment history, illegal activities, problems resulting from use of drugs, perceptions of the risks involved, personal and family income sources and amounts, need for treatment for drug or alcohol use, criminal record, and needle-sharing. Questions on mental health and access to care, which were introduced in the 1994-B questionnaire (see NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, 1994 [ICPSR 6949]), were retained in this administration of the survey. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, motor vehicle use, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, and past and current household

Therefore, estimates produced from the 1995 survey are not comparable to those produced from the 1994-A and earlier surveys.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For selected variables, statistical imputation was performed following logical imputation to replace missing responses. These variables are identified in the codebook as \"...LOGICALLY IMPUTED\" and \"...imputed\" for the logical procedure or by the designation \"IMPUTATION-REVISED\" in the variable label when the statistical procedure was also performed. The names of statistically imputed variables begin with the letters \"IR\". For each imputation-revised variable there is a corresponding imputation indicator variable that indicates whether a case's value on the variable resulted from an interview response or was imputed by the hot-deck technique. Hot-deck imputation is described in the codebook.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The \"basic sampling weights\" are equal to the inverse of the probabilities of selection of sample respondents. To obtain \"final NHSDA weights,\" the basic weights were adjusted to take into account dwelling unit-level and individual-level nonresponse and further adjusted to ensure consistency with intercensal population projections from the United States Bureau of the Census.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: To protect the confidentiality of respondents, all variables that could be used to identify individuals have been encrypted or collapsed in the public use file. These modifications should not affect analytic uses of the public use file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Users who wish to replicate results published in the NHSDA Main Findings Report or other SAMHSA reports should use the 1995 NHSDA imputed data for prevalence estimates rather than raw data from the questionnaire or drug answer sheets.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Family and personal income range variables were constructed from two imputation-revised variables that were deleted from the public use dataset and codebook due to confidentiality issues. Users are advised that the recoded income range variables cannot be replicated from the imputation-revised variables (IRFINC1 and IRPINC1) contained in the public use file.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: For some drugs that have multiple names, questions regarding the use of that drug may be asked for each distinct name.

A total of 115 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs), including areas of high Hispanic concentration, were selected to represent the total United States population. These PSUs were defined as metropolitan areas, counties, groups of counties, and independent cities. Of the 115 PSUs, 43 were selected with certainty and 72 were randomly selected with probability proportional to size. Based on correlations between past-month cigarette smoking and drug use, cigarette smokers were oversampled to increase the precision of drug use estimates. The four age groups were: ages 12-17, 18-34, 35-49, and 50 and older. The three race/ethnic groups were: Whites/others, Blacks, and Hispanics. Blacks and Hispanics were oversampled.
