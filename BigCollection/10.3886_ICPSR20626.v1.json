First, the interviewer specifically asked whether the woman was in a situation where they could be assured of privacy and could answer in an open manner. If the woman said that she could not, the interviewer offered to call back at another time when privacy was more likely.

Researchers used random-digit-dial (RDD) methodology to recruit this sample.  Recruitment of this sample involved three steps. First, the sample was geographically stratified to ensure that it was distributed across regions of the country at the same proportion as is the population. Second, a sample of assigned land line telephone banks was randomly selected from an enumeration of the Working Residential Hundreds Block (blocks of 100 telephone numbers) within the active telephone exchanges within the strata. Third, a two-digit number was randomly generated by a computer for each Working Residential Hundreds Block.  Every telephone number within the Hundreds Block had an equal probability of being selected, regardless of whether it was listed or unlisted.</p>\n\n<p>The Part 2 (College Population) data originated from a list sample for college women that was purchased from the American Student List (ASL). The sampling frame was restricted to women attending four-year institutions of higher education. The sample purchased contained about 17,000 respondents in order to generate responses that were similar to the national census representation of college women. The sample was classified into nine regions: New England, Mid Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, and Pacific. The sample was then released to be dialed (land lines only) in proportion to the national census representation of college women. This procedure was designed to ensure adequate representation of the United States population of college women.
