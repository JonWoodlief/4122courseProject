Respondents were asked for their opinions of President Bush and his handling of the presidency, the war against terrorism, and foreign policy, as well as their views of Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The remainder of the questions focused on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and the United States' use of military force in response to the events of September 11, 2001.  Respondents were asked whether Israel and/or the Palestinians  desired peace enough to make real concessions, whether they believed Israel was acting justly in reacting militarily to recent suicide bombings, and whether they believe Arafat had done all he could to stop the suicide bombings. Those surveyed were asked whether Israel had too much influence over United States foreign policy, whether Bush had enough experience to negotiate peace in the Middle East, and if they supported sending American troops to the Middle East to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Respondents were asked whether they supported the United States' attacks against Afghanistan, as well as the use of military force against countries such as Iraq and Somalia to combat terrorism, whether they believed such action increased the risk of further terrorist attacks against the United States, and whether such action could lead to a war between Western and Muslim countries. Finally, respondents were asked whether they believed it was the responsibility of the United States to bring peace to the Middle East.
