We demonstrate that a well-known class of statistical models, called ﬁnite mixture models, provides an effective way of rival theory testing. In the proposed framework, each observation is assumed to be generated from a statistical model implied by one of the competing theories or more generally from a weighted combination of multiple statistical models under consideration. Researchers can then estimate the probability that a speciﬁc observation is consistent with either of the competing theories. By directly modeling this probability with covariates, one can also determine the conditions under which a particular theory applies. We discuss a principled way to identify a list of observations that are statistically signiﬁcantly consistent with each theory. Finally, we propose several measures of the overall performance of each rival theory. We illustrate the advantages of our method through empirical and simulation studies."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"finite mixture models, theory testing, non-nested model selection"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A Statistical Method for Empirical Testing of Competing Theories, American Journal of Political Science"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-07-31"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Replication materials and appendix.","label":"AJPSReplicationDistribution.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61315,"categories":["Replication materials"],"dataFile":{"id":2327270,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"AJPSReplicationDistribution.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":32888355,"description":"Replication materials and appendix.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:78026","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5380394dc8e9b4f114b94cdf3be2c52b","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5380394dc8e9b4f114b94cdf3be2c52b"}}}]}}}
