To address these research questions this study tested an empirical model that described relevant factors regarding perceived barriers to help-seeking and explored if and how this model changed based on the identified variables.

All had signed a consent form confirming their willingness to be contacted for an interview. The interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish, according to each participant's preference. Respondents first were asked to describe their relationship to their abuser and then presented with the questions from each section of the PBHS Assessment, i.e., behavior of the abuser, internal barriers to help-seeking and external barriers to help seeking. Respondents were asked to clarify and discuss their responses in their own words. Each respondent was encouraged to talk in some detail about whether they would chose (or had chosen) to discuss the abuse they had experienced with others. They were also offered an opportunity to discuss anything that they felt was important but not covered in their previous responses. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim by the interviewer. The interview transcripts were entered into Atlas.ti.

Described abuser behaviors information included questions about whether the respondent was afraid of the abuser, whether the abuser gets angry with the respondent if they talk to anyone the abuser does not know, whether the abuser makes it difficult for the  respondent to spend time with their family, whether their decisions are based on what the abuser wants them to do, whether the abuser suspects that the respondent is cheating on them, whether the respondent has no privacy, and whether the abuser would hurt the respondent if they told anyone about their problems. Personal attitudes and beliefs information included whether the respondent thought a women her age should tell someone if she was hurt by a person close to her, take care of her family no matter how they treat her, is responsible for making the people she is close to happy, should do whatever it takes to keep her family together, put the needs of her family before her own, cannot change problems in her close personal relationships, should discuss family problems with a doctor or counselor, whether the respondent thought there is nothing a woman her age can do about emotional or physical abuse when it has been going on for many years, and whether the respondent thought that it is better for a woman her age to be with someone who treats her badly than for her to be alone. In addition the personal attitudes and beliefs variables asked the respondent whether a woman her age should tolerate being scared or hurt by her husband, according to their religious beliefs, whether family members expect a woman her age to keep the family together no matter how she is treated, whether she thought the police are helpful to women her age who are hurt by people close to them, whether friends expect a woman her age to \"stick it out\" when they are hurt by someone close to them, whether she thought that police will not do anything to help when they go to a house where there is domestic abuse involving a woman her age, whether she thought that family members would get angry at a woman her age who presses charges with the police when someone close to her hurts her, whether she thought that the community she lives in has services to help a woman her age who is hurt by a family member or close friend, and whether she believes a woman her age is to blame when she is hurt by another family member or close friend. Experiences of domestic\nabuse were gathered using the Conflict Tactics Scales-Revised, Short Version (CTS2S). This scale measured whether the respondent experienced domestic abuse by asking the respondent how often their abuser insulted or swore at them, suffered a sprain, bruise, or small cut or felt pain the next day because of a fight with their abuser, showed respect for, or showed that they cared about the respondent's feelings about an issue they disagreed on, punched, kicked or beat up the respondent, destroyed something belonging to the respondent or threatened to hit them, or used force to make the respondent have sex with them. Mental status/cognitive impairment information was collected by asking respondents what was the name of the building they were in at the time, where the building was located, what day of the month it was, what day of the week it was, what year it was, how old they were, when their birthday is, what year they were born, what was the name of the President at the time, and who the President was before the current one.
