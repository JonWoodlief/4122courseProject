The focus of this poll was the Iraq war and whether respondents watched President Bush's speech on Iraq on the night of January 10, 2007. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way President Bush was handling the situation in Iraq, whether the war with Iraq was worth fighting, and whether President Bush or Congress would do a better job handling the situation in Iraq. Opinions were solicited on Bush's proposal to send additional military forces to Iraq, whether increasing the number of military forces would make a difference in the length of the war, the ability of the Iraqi government to meet its' political and economic commitments, whether the United States is winning the war in Iraq, and whether the United States' involvement in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam war.
