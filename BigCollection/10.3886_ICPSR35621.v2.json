Topics covered by the fourth round of the survey (fourth quarter 2013) include self-reported health status, type of and satisfaction with current health insurance coverage, access to and use of health care, health care affordability, use of information about the health insurance plans offered through the health insurance exchanges created by the ACA, enrollment in health plans or Medicaid through the ACA exchanges, the importance of various criteria in choosing health insurance plans, whether the respondent received notice that his/her current insurance policy was cancelled or would no longer be offered after 2013, worries about future health insurance coverage, and expectations about one's health insurance coverage in 2014. Additional information collected by the survey includes age, education, race, Hispanic origin, gender, income, household size, housing type, marital status, employment status, United States citizenship, smoking, internet access, home ownership, body mass index, sexual orientation, and whether the respondent reported an ambulatory care sensitive condition or a mental or behavioral condition."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care access"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA II.
