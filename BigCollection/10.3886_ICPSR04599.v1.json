The surveys attempt to address many current  issues in education, such as preprimary education, school safety and  discipline, adult education, and activities related to citizenship.</p>\n\n<p>This survey included three topical survey components.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The Early Childhood Program Participation Survey</strong>\naddressed the nonparental care and program participation of preschool  children, that is, children from birth through age six and not yet  enrolled in kindergarten or higher grades. The survey collected  information on all of the child's current, regular care arrangements,  such as care by a relative or by someone not related to the child, in  a private home as well as at a day care center or preschool, including  Head Start. Information was collected about the number of hours per  week or per month that the child received nonparental care, as well as  parental perceptions of the factors associated with choosing such  care. Other information was collected on topics such as educational  activities at home, emerging literacy and numeracy, the child's  characteristics (including health and disability status), and  parent/guardian and household characteristics. Interviews were  completed with parents of 7,209 preschool children.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The After-School Programs and Activities Survey</strong>\nfocused on  children enrolled in kindergarten through eighth grade who were aged  15 years or younger. Parents reported on the after-school arrangemen\nts  in which their children participated, including care by relatives or  nonrelatives in a private home, after-school programs in schools or  centers, activities that might provide adult supervision in the  after-school hours, and children's self-care. Other information  includes reasons for choosing parental care, the child's  characteristics (including health and disability status), and  parent/guardian and household characteristics. Interviews were  conducted with the parents of 11,684 students.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Adult Education Survey</strong>\nmeasured participation in the  following types of formal educational activities: English as a Second  Language (ESL), basic skills and General Education Development (GED)  preparation courses, college or university degree or certificate  programs, vocational or technical diploma programs, apprenticeship  programs, courses or training for work-related reasons, and  personal-interest classes or courses. In addition, information was  collected on participation in informal learning activities for  personal interest. The survey also gathered information on employer  support for educational activities. Detailed information about  educational attainment, employment, and household characteristics was  also collected from both participants and nonparticipants. Adults aged  16 and older who were not enrolled in twelfth grade or below, who were  noninstitutionalized, and who were not serving on active military duty  were eligible for this survey. Interviews were completed with 8,904  respondents, 4,732 of whom had participated in formal educational  activities in the past year and 4,172 of whom had not.</p></li>\n</ul>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adult education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"after school programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"basic skills"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"caregivers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"early childhood education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"English as a Second Language"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Head Start"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"home environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"home schooling"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parental attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preschool children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school age children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CCEERC I.
