The specific objectives of the project are: 1) To characterize target farming landscapes and systems, and develop tools for matching species and management options to sites and circumstances. 2) To generalize predictions of impacts of tree species and management on crop productivity, water resources and nutrients at field, farm and landscape scales to inform scaling up to improve food security and reduce climate risk. 3) To develop effective methods and enabling environments for scaling up and out the adoption of trees on farms. 4) To develop databases and tools for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of scaling up and out the adoption of trees on farms. 5) To enhance capacity and connectivity of national partner institutions (including farmer groups) in developing and promoting locally appropriate options for adoption of farm trees."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-03-26"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Tree diversity"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/worldagroforestry.org.agrof/files/agroforests_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/worldagroforestry.org.agrof/files/agroforests_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-03-26"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-06-01"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-05-31"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Tree diversity"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ethiopia, Rwanda"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"East Africa"}}]}]}},"files":[{"label":"0.Disclaimer.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":129470,"dataFile":{"id":3059389,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/25219/LSCJPM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/25219/LSCJPM","filename":"0.Disclaimer.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":304802,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f2ec92406-3a8e2c8cf2e2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"46ac594e688ae98d0b0828ceb42fbdcc","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"46ac594e688ae98d0b0828ceb42fbdcc"}}},{"description":"Burundi Vegetation map","label":"Burundi sites_vegetation map.pdf","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":129470,"categories":["Map"],"dataFile":{"id":2465513,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/25219/D9ZW8L","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/25219/D9ZW8L","filename":"Burundi sites_vegetation map.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":485962,"description":"Burundi Vegetation map","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:194441","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"5e31ff466caefe20a369bbb2b628e627","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"5e31ff466caefe20a369bbb2b628e627"}}}]}}}
