The second stage consisted of a probability sample for 1973 of 1,695 practicing physicians selected from the master files maintained by the AMA and AOA. Within each PSU, all eligible physicians were stratified by nine specialty groups. The groups are: general/family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, other medical specialties, general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, other surgical specialties, psychiatry, and other specialties. The number of physicians in scope and agreeing to participate was 1,103. The final stage was the selection of patient visits within the annual practices of sample physicians. This involved two steps. First, the total physician sample was divided into 52 with each group randomly assigned to 1 of the 52 weeks in the survey year. Second, a systematic random sample of visits was selected by the physician during the assigned week. The total number of patient records for these visits was 29,102."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1973","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38688,"dataFile":{"id":2639657,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1973","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
