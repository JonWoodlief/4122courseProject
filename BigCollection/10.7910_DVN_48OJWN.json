The international relations literature remains divided on whether, when, and how reputation matters in both inter-state and intra-state conflict.  We examine reputation building through a series of incentivized laboratory experiments.  Using comparative statics from a repeated entry-deterrence game we isolate how incentives for reputation building should change as the number of entrants changes.  We find that subjects in our experiments generally build reputations and that those investments paid off, but we also find that some subjects did not react to incentives to build reputation in ways our model had predicted.  In order to explain this, we focus on the heterogeneity of preferences and cognitive abilities that may exist in any population.  Our research suggests that rational-choice scholars of international relations and those using more psychologically based explanations have more common ground than previously articulated."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Effect of Repeated Play on Reputation Building:  An Experimental Approach, 2011, International Organization"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-07"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-07-09"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"IO-Figures.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":61314,"categories":["replication files, instructional files, experimental interface program (zTree)"],"dataFile":{"id":1577207,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"IO-Figures.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":177138,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:59158","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d6d484ab8edb949c21be3b8e47dd40d8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d6d484ab8edb949c21be3b8e47dd40d8"}}}]}}}
