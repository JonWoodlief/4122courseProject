Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.</p>\n<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sponsored the supplement survey as part of its efforts to bring unbanked and underbanked consumers into the economic mainstream. The FDIC plans to use the results to better inform policy-making on issues related to economic inclusion.  The supplement questions were asked of all interviewed households, as appropriate.  Respondents were queried on their households banking status, use of financial services, and use of alternative financial services like payday lending.
