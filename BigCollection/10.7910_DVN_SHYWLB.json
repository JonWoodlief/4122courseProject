Systems to store and manage these metadata have improved over time, but in most cases are ad-hoc collections of data relationships, often represented in domain or site specific application code. We are developing a general set of tools to store, manage, and retrieve datarelationship metadata. These tools will be agnostic to the underlying data storage mechanisms, and to the data stored in them, making the system applicable across a wide range of science domains.\r\n\r\nData management tools typically represent at least one relationship paradigm through implicit or explicit metadata. The addition of these metadata allows the data to be searched and understood by larger groups of users over longer periods of time. Using these systems, researchers are less dependent on one on one communication with the scientists involved in running the experiments, nor to rely on their ability to remember the details of their data. In the magnetic fusion research community, the MDSplus system is widely used to record raw and processed data from experiments. Users create a hierarchical relationship tree for each instance of their experiment, allowing them to record the meanings of what is recorded. Most users of this system, add to this a set of ad-hoc tools to help users locate specific experiment runs, which they can then access via this hierarchical organization. However, the MDSplus tree is only one possible organization of the records, and these additional applications that relate the experiment 'shots' into run days, experimental proposals, logbook entries, run summaries, analysis work flow, publications, etc. have up until now, been implemented on an experiment by experiment basis.\r\n\r\nThe Metadata Provenance Ontology project, MPO, is a system built to record data provenance information about computed results. It allows users to record the inputs and outputs from each step of their computational workflows, in particular, what raw and processed data were used as inputs, what codes were run and what results were produced. The resulting collections of provenance graphs can be annotated, grouped, searched, filtered and browsed. This provides a powerful tool to record, understand, and locate computed results. However, this can be understood as one more specific data relationship, which can be construed as an instance of something more general.\r\n\r\nBuilding on concepts developed in these projects, we are developing a general system that could be used to represent all of these kinds of data relationships as mathematical graphs. Just as MDSplus and MPO were generalizations of data management needs for a collection of users, this new system will generalize the storage, location, and retrieval of the relationships between data. The system will store data relationships as data, not encoded in a set of application specific programs or ad hoc data structures. Stored data, would be referred to by URIs allowing the system to be agnostic to the underlying data representations. Users can then traverse these graphs. The system will allow users to construct a collection of graphs describing ANY OR ALL OF the relationships between data items, locate interesting data, see what other graphs these data are members of and navigate into and through them."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alcator C-Mod"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"data management"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Metadata"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"navigation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ontologies"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/16ja/16ja018/16ja018_abs.html\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-16-18</a><br /><br />This work supported by NSF DIBBS award 1640829"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"16ja018_fig1_data.hdf","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"var/www/html/reports/16JA/16JA18","version":1,"datasetVersionId":136755,"dataFile":{"id":3150081,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/SHYWLB/OIBUYQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SHYWLB/OIBUYQ","filename":"16ja018_fig1_data.hdf","contentType":"application/x-hdf","filesize":14880,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1632cdacea3-84041d4b4d3b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"47b60abe8d6ebc1028ccd989093397c9","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"47b60abe8d6ebc1028ccd989093397c9"}}},{"description":"","label":"16ja018_fig1_image.pdf","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"var/www/html/reports/16JA/16JA18","version":1,"datasetVersionId":136755,"dataFile":{"id":3150079,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/SHYWLB/UAFJQN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SHYWLB/UAFJQN","filename":"16ja018_fig1_image.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":27608,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1632cdace9f-52603676b68f","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6dd6a13767eed42c2ab6c76ede881915","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6dd6a13767eed42c2ab6c76ede881915"}}},{"description":"","label":"archival_16ja018_full.pdf","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"var/www/html/reports/16JA/16JA18","version":1,"datasetVersionId":136755,"dataFile":{"id":3150080,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/SHYWLB/VSOLSZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SHYWLB/VSOLSZ","filename":"archival_16ja018_full.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":10183863,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1632cdace71-321f817e8065","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"aaae362b6a86889959973659bd093a84","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"aaae362b6a86889959973659bd093a84"}}}]}}}
