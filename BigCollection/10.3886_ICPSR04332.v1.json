Roberts, the United States Court  of Appeals judge nominated to the United States Supreme Court by  President George W. Bush. Respondents were queried as to whether they  thought the United States Senate should confirm Roberts' nomination,  and whether a senator who believed Roberts was qualified, but  disagreed with his judicial philosophy, should vote against the  nomination. They were also asked whether Democrats or Republicans in  the Senate would be too aggressive or not aggressive enough during the  confirmation hearing, and if, during the confirmation hearing, Roberts  should answer questions about how he would have ruled on past cases  that have come before the Supreme Court. Respondents were also asked  if the Roe v. Wade case came before the court again, would they want  Roberts to vote to uphold or to overturn the ruling. Respondents were  queried as to whether they felt disappointment that President Bush did  not nominate another woman to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice  Sandra Day O'Connor, if the Supreme Court tended to be too  conservative, too liberal, or balanced in its decisions, and on what  criteria the United States Supreme Court should base its rulings.  Demographic variables include race, gender, age, level of education,  employment status, income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, and religious affiliation."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"confirmation hearings"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"judge selection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Roberts, John G."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court justices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court nominations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Supreme Court"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
