Over half of the participants were students at prestigious Japanese universities. Fourteen of the women had completed their schooling, and their ages ranged from 24 to 60 years old. The students represented all four college classes and a variety of majors.<br /><br />  The participants were given six Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) verbal cues to assess the motive to avoid success as originally designed by Horner.\r\nVerbal leads (rather than picture cues) were used to eliminate as many cultural biases as possible. The participants also responded to a short sentence completion test and described three events in their lives in which they felt successful, or a situation in which they felt they had failed. Fourteen forced-choice questions determined risk preference. An anagram test assessed performance under various conditions. At the conclusion of the testing sessions, participants answered questions about stage of life, educational background, career aspirations, and family background. A small subsample of the participants was interviewed.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds numeric file data. Thematic Apperception Tests and the remainder of the questionnaires are available in Japanese while some of the data have been translated into English.
