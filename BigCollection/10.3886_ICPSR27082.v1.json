The victimization rates for each year from 1973 to 2005 were estimated by using information available in the incident and person-level files, resulting in 33 years of data. For many of the NCVS rates, the researchers were able to rely on the concatenated incident-level file to produce the sample weighted incident counts. However, estimation of some of the rates required the use of annual incident-level and person-level files. More specifically, the researchers used annual incident files for the estimates for the 1970s, and used annual person-level files to create the denominators for all years. Violent victimization rates were defined to include attempted and completed crimes of rape, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The study contains 176 total variables including the year, 135 violent victimization rate variables, and 40 population variables.
