The data were originally recorded on cards; however, in the files which make up this dataset at the University of Texas, these cards have been eliminated to create sequential files that can be easily manipulated with the SPSS program. Two sequential filesets were created: one set for housing characteristics, and another set for person-records. Each household was given a unique number and it is possible to match up persons with households or with dwelling units. The files were also structured in such a manner as to permit levels of analysis at several different kinds of geographic levels. It is strongly suggested that each user become familiar with both the published materials and the working documents which describe these data, in addition to the Coding Manual and User's Guide. These are the following: 1. A 149-page booklet entitled 'La Situaci√≥n del Empleo en la Zona Urbana en Junio de 1980 (Resultados de la Encuesta Nacional Urbana de Mano de Obra)', published in July 1982 2. A 29-chapter unpaginated collection of working papers pertaining to this survey entitled 'Encuesta Nacional Urbana de Mano de Obra, Mayo-Junio 1980', dated July 1982. This document was not formally published in the Dominican Republic, and consists of xeroxed copies of appropriate working documents used in constructing this dataset. These working documents contain highly detailed explanations of how questions were constructed, evaluated, and ultimately coded on the survey form, and go significantly beyond the previous publication in breadth and depth of meaning. It is strongly suggested that these documents be consulted before any analyses of these data are undertaken. The data file to which this document refers is the set of individual person-records gathered during the survey. The file contains 13,283 person-records arranged according to the order in which the information about them is presented in the original questionnaire."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include literacy and education, work hours, pay, benefits, etc."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"food"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income distribution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor markets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"statistical data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"urban areas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR IV.

They were contracted to review the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic's Household Consumption Survey (1976-77) and determine the steps necessary to process and analyze the data. The two consultants also provided the Central Bank programmers and analysts with advice on how to document the dataset and gave a seminar on consumption analysis. In 1980, they assisted with the final cleaning of the data and helped install several editing and statistical packages on the Bank's computer. They helped with data analysis and advised on their use for policy purposes. This data was to be utilized in an effort to strengthen the nutrition component of the \"Health Sector Project\", and possibly, in the formation of a nutrition planning capability in the USAID Health Sector Project.
