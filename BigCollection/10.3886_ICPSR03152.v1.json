The study  differed from previous research in that it addressed the level of  force used by the police relative to the suspect's level of  resistance.

The Eugene and  Springfield dataset (Part 2) was created from items in the Police  Officers' Essential Physical Work Report Form, which was completed by  members of the Eugene and Springfield, Oregon, Police Departments  during April 1995. The dataset includes all police-citizen contacts,  rather than being limited to the use-of-force situations captured by  the Metro-Dade data. In Part 1 (Metro-Dade Data), information on the  subject includes impairment (i.e., alcohol and drugs), behavior  (i.e., calm, visibly upset, erratic, or highly agitated), level of  resistance used by the subject, types of injuries to the subject, and  types of force used by the subject. Information on the officer  includes level of force used, medical treatment, and injuries. Other  variables include ethnic match between officer and the subject and  relative measures of force. Demographic variables include age,  gender, race, and ethnicity of both the subject and the officer. In  Part 2 (Oregon Data), information is provided on whether the officer  was alone, how work was initiated, elapsed time until arrival,  reasons for performance, perceived mental state and physical  abilities of the suspect, amount and type of resistance by the  suspect, if another officer assisted, perceived extent of effort used  by the suspect, type of resistance used by the suspect, if the  officer was knocked or wrestled to the ground, if the officer  received an injury, level of effort used to control the suspect,  types of control tactics used on the suspect, whether the officer was  wearing tactical gear, how restraint devices were applied to inmate,  time taken to get to, control, resolve, and remove the problem, how  stressful the lead-up time or the period following the incident was,  if the officer worked with a partner, types of firearm used, and if  force was used.

Although data on this issue are critical to both the  police and the public, the data remain difficult to collect, measure,  and interpret objectively. The Violent Crime Control and Law  Enforcement Act of 1994 requires the United States Attorney General  to collect information on law enforcement officers' use of  force. This act has led to an energetic effort to collect data on all  police use-of-force incidents, including excessive force, by various  groups and methods.
