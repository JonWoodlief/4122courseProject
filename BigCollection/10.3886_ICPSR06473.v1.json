The Household Survey was fielded over four rounds of   personal and telephone interviews at four-month intervals. Baseline   data on household composition, employment, and insurance   characteristics were updated each quarter, and information on all uses   of and expenditures for health care services and sources of payment was   obtained. Public Use Tape 29 provides information on disability days   and household-reported medical conditions for 1987. There are five data   files in this collection. Part 1, Medical Conditions Data, contains one   record for each medical condition reported by a respondent. Variables   include information on whether the respondent saw or talked to a   medical provider about the condition, beginning and ending dates of the   condition, whether the condition was due to an accident, the body area   affected by the condition, and whether the respondent or a doctor   discovered the condition. In Part 2, Disability Days Data, a record   represents a unique disability defined by the combination of disability   type and disability period. Variables describe up to four different   types of disabilities due to illness or injury that were collected over   the four rounds of the interviews. The types of disabilities are   work-loss days, school-loss days, bed days, and restricted-activity   days. In addition, beginning and ending dates of the disability period,   number of disability days, and medical conditions associated with the   disability period are also included. Part 3, Disability Days to Medical   Conditions Link File, contains the variables necessary to link each   disabi\nlity days record in Part 2 with one or more of the condition   records in Part 1. Variables include the type of event this record   links to, condition number, condition ID, event number, event ID,   person ID, and provider number. Part 4, Medical Conditions to Medical   Utilization and Expenditures Link File, contains the variables   necessary to link each condition record in Part 1 with one or more of   the records contained in NATIONAL MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY, 1987:   PRESCRIBED MEDICINE DATA [PUBLIC USE TAPE 14.1] (ICPSR 9746), NATIONAL   MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY, 1987: HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA ON HOME HEALTH   CARE AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PURCHASES AND RENTALS [PUBLIC USE TAPE 14.2]   (ICPSR 9944), NATIONAL MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY, 1987: HOUSEHOLD   SURVEY, DENTAL VISIT DATA [PUBLIC USE TAPE 14.3] (ICPSR 9814), NATIONAL   MEDICAL EXPENDITURE SURVEY, 1987: HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, HOSPITAL STAYS DATA   [PUBLIC USE TAPE 14.4] (ICPSR 9840), or NATIONAL MEDICAL EXPENDITURE   SURVEY, 1987: AMBULATORY MEDICAL VISIT DATA [PUBLIC USE TAPE 14.5]   (ICPSR 9881). Variables include original dwelling unit, person number,   person identifier, condition number, condition ID, event number and   identifier, provider number, and type of event this record links to.   Part 5, NMES Household Survey Modified ICD-9-CM Label File, contains a   record for each of the condition codes reported in the NMES Household  Survey and the Survey of American Indians and Alaska Natives (SAIAN)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disabilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care costs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health expenditures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health services utilization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household composition"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"illness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"injuries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"insurance coverage"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"payment methods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
