The investigators  coded, recoded, and computerized parts of the raw data from Sheldon  and Eleanor Glueck's three-wave, matched sample study of juvenile and  adult criminal behavior, extracting the criminal histories of the 500  delinquents (officially defined) from the Glueck study. Data were  originally collected by the Gluecks in 1940 through psychiatric  interviews with subjects, parent and teacher reports, and official  records obtained from police, court, and correctional files. The  subjects were subsequently interviewed again between 1949 and 1965 at  or near the age of 25, and again at or near the age of 32. The data  coded by Laub and Sampson include only information collected from  official records. The data address in part (1) what effects  probation, incarceration, and parole have on the length of criminal  career and frequency of criminal incidents of an offender, (2) how  the effects of criminal control policies vary in relation to the  length of sentence, type of offense, and age of the offender, (3)  which factors in criminal control policy correlate with criminal  career termination, (4) how well age of first offense predicts the  length of criminal career, and (5) how age of offender relates to  type of offense committed. Every incident of arrest up to the age of  32 for each respondent (ranging from 1 to 51 arrests) is recorded in  the data file. Variables include the dates of arrest, up to three  charges associated with the arrest, court disposition, and starting  and ending dates of probation, incarceration, and parole associated with the arrest."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career criminals"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime control"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime control policies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminality prediction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
