Low appreciation on the benefits provided by the ecosystem has led to the overutilization of resources, causing negative impacts to biodiversity and environment. In the Philippines, biodiversity conservation has not been given enough priority, and has been beset with various problems such as insufficient funding. This usually applies in coastal communities, where majority of community members have low capacity to contribute monetarily. However\r\n, the rising occurrence of climate-related phenomena also increases the awareness of communities and their willingness to contribute to environmental conservation activities such as Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES). This study aimed to value the coastal conservation activities from households of Oroquieta City through contingent valuation method. The computed mean willingness to pay for coastal conservation using parametric estimation was PhP 30.39, wherein the estimated mean willingness to pay translates to 0.23% of their average income. Potential revenue to be collected annually could amount to PhP 1.8 million. In five years, the total collection could reach PhP 9 million, which is also substantial to make the biodiversity conservation activities sustainable. The estimation of this study could serve as basis for implementation of PES in the the coastal communities for sustainable biodiversity conservation."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"coastal biodiversity conservation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"natural resource economics"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"payments for ecosystem services (PES)"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"valuation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"willingness to pay"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Oroquieta City Households’ Willingness to Pay for Coastal Biodiversity Conservation"},"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"10.5539/jsd.v7n5p82"},"publicationURL":{"typeName":"publicationURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jsd/article/view/32278"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"producerAbbreviation":{"typeName":"producerAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/worldagroforestry.org.agrof/files/agroforests_logo.jpg"}},{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish Centre"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldfishcenter.org/"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.cgiar-csi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/logo_worldfish.png"}},{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Department of Science and Technology"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.dost.gov.ph/"},"producerLogoURL":{"typeName":"producerLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.dost.gov.ph/images/headers/masthead.png"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Agroforestry Centre"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICRAF"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/worldagroforestry.org.agrof/files/agroforests_logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-30"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Survey data"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Philippines"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Disclaimer for data use","label":"Disclaimer.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":75845,"categories":["0.
