Respondents were asked to give their views on how they would like to see presidential candidates spend their time, the impact of the government on society, the most important problem facing the Unite\nd States, and campaign issues. Specifically, respondents were asked what a president could do to improve Medicare, Social Security, education, health care, and the economy and how the federal budget surplus should be used. Those queried were also asked with whom the responsibility rested to care for the needy, promote values, insure jobs and an adequate standard of living, provide job training, and improve education and welfare. Respondents were asked if, in the last four years, they had contacted a member of Congress or a newspaper editor, done public service, worked on a political campaign, signed a petition, called a talk show, attended a political function, or given a political contribution. Views were also sought on the upcoming 2000 presidential election, including the Democratic and Republican primaries/caucuses. Respondents were asked for whom they intend to vote: Vice President Al Gore, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, Texas governor George W. Bush, Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, Family Research Council President Gary Bauer, talk show host Alan Keyes, Utah senator Orrin Hatch, or former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole. Additional topics covered the effectiveness of the political system in the United States, the respondents' opinions of the Democratic and Republican parties, and whether the state and/or federal government accurately represented respondents' views. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, Hispanic descent, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, education, religion, marital status, computer access, stock market investments, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
