This level includes general information about the\r dispute such as its start dates and end dates, the numb\ner of participants, its name, the highest level of hostility reached, the outcome of the dispute, etc. (b) The individual\nparticipant level. This level provides entry and exit dates for each participant, the side it took in the dispute, the highest level of hostility reached, and so forth.\r Extrapolation from the individual level to the dyadic level by simple computerized means may cause considerable errors.

However, performing such a combination on multilateral dispute may cause a great number of errors. Here are some examples of such errors.</li><br />\r \r <li>Beyond these problems of extrapolation, there is a need to redefine certain variables at the dyadic level. For example, for some analyses, it makes sense to have an annual record of ongoing MIDs, while for others it is only necessary to look at the start year\nof the dispute. The minimum and maximum duration variables that are listed at the dispute level are not very useful when it comes to dyadic analyses, as each dyad may have a different duration from each other dyad within the same dispute. Likewise, the outcome and settlement of the dispute may not apply to all dyads.\n</li>\r </ol>"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2005"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Zeev Maoz"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://psfaculty.ucdavis.edu/zmaoz/"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2008-05-07"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Data file","label":"dyadmid20.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":51435,"categories":["2.
