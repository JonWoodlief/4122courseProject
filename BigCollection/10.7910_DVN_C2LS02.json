Their investigation may sometimes be complex and expensive. The aim of our study was to analyze variables associated with premature beats identified in outpatients referred from a primary care facility.\r\nMethods – We performed a cross-sectional study of 407 outpatients (aged 55.8±11years; 56% women) who were followed by general practitioners and were referred for resting 12-lead electrocardiograms for a routine clinical follow-up. After signing informed consent, patients answered a questionnaire and underwent physical examinations, laboratory diagnostics, transthoracic echocardiograms and 24-hour Holter monitoring to evaluate for the presence of premature complexes. After the univariate analyses, logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustment for age, sex, and cardiovascular diseases. \r\nResults – Premature complexes distribution revealed that they were frequent but with low density. Premature atrial complexes (≥ 4/hours) were associated with age (Odds Ratio (OD)=1.030, Confidence Interval (CI) 95%=1.002 ─ 1.059, p=0.029), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels > 20mg/dL (OR=4.489, 95%CI=1.918 ─ 10.507, p=0.0005), intraventricular blocks (OR=4.184, 95%CI=1.816 ─ 9.406, p=0.0005) and left atrial diameter (OR=1.065, 95%CI=1.001 ─ 1.134, p=0.046). Premature ventricular complexes (≥ 5/hour) were related to age (OR=1.032, 95%CI=1.010 ─ 1.054, p=0.004), the use of calcium channel blockers (OR=2.248, 95%CI=1.019 ─ 4.954, p=0.045), HDL-cholesterol levels (OR=0.971, 95%CI=0.951 ─ 0.992, p=0.007), BNP levels > 20mg/dL (OR=2.079, 95%CI=0.991 ─ 0.998, p=0.033), heart rate (OR=1.019, 95%CI=1.001 ─ 1.038, p=0.041), left ventricular hypertrophy (OR=2.292, 95%CI=1.402 ─ 3.746, p=0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction (OR=0.938, 95%CI=0.900 ─ 0.978, p=0.002). \r\nConclusions – Premature complexes had low density and were associated with BNP levels > 20mg/dL, lower levels of HDL-cholesterol, left atrial enlargement and ventricular hypertrophy. The identification of premature complexes on 24-hour Holter monitor recordings of outpatients in a primary public healthcare setting was associated with uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors that may be addressed with medical advice and therapy in a primary care setting.
