The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also administered in June 2001 (ICPSR 4043) and February 2002 (ICPSR 4031). These three supplements comprise the 2001-2002 waves of TUS data.</p>\n<p>The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.</p>\n<p>All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS monthly items were eligible for the TUS, which consisted of items PES32 through PES77.  The TUS was mainly designed to be a proxy response survey, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent questions. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for questions on the topics of smoking status (items PES32-PES34) and the use of other tobacco products; for example, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PES62A-PES63B).</p>\n<p>Additionally, self-respondents were asked various questions depending on their smoking status -- former, everyday, or occasional (items PES36-PES46 and PES55-PES61). Current everyday and occasional smokers were then asked whether the medical community had advised them to quit smoking or if they were planning to quit in the near future (items PES47-PES54). Self-respondents were further queried on smoking policies in their work place (items PES67-PES71), smoking rules in the home (item PES73) and questions on opinions about smoking (items PES72, PES75-PES77).</p>\n<p>Administrative information was collected on who the proxy respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected includes age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"addiction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census
