It was  designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of  both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the  project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,  adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the  project provided a detailed look at the environments in which  these social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts  of data about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and  resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which  was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over  6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and  their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing  circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,  that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial  behaviors. The age cohorts include birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18  year\ns.

The HOME inventory was composed of questions  administered to the subject's primary caregiver and subjects belonging  to Cohort 18.  The purpose of the HOME inventory was to evaluate the  various aspects of the subject's developmental environment that could  affect future positive or negative social behaviors. To this end, the  HOME inventory summarized the primary caregiver's responsivity to and  acceptance of the subject, the interaction between the subject and  other members of the subject's immediate and extended family,  particularly the subject's father, the positive and negative  reinforcement received by the subject from the primary caregiver, the  subject's access to various learning materials and toys either at home  or at school, the rules and limitations placed on the subject, verbal  communication between the subject and the primary caregiver, and the  variety of experiences encountered by the subject. However, the HOME  inventory as adapted by the PHDCN study was not limited to observing  the quality of the intellectual and psychological aspects of the  subject's developmental environment. In addition, the PHDCN version of  the HOME inventory carefully assessed the various aspects of the  physical environment in which the subjects lived, including the living  conditions present inside the home as well as the state of the surrounding neighborhood.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p><strong>Project on Human Development in Chicago  Neighborhoods</strong></p>\n\n<p>The city of Chicago was selected as the research site for the PHDCN  because of its extensive racial, ethnic, and social-class diversity.  The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into  343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of  racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.  The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were  composed of geographically contiguous census tracts and geographic  boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered  in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately  8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample  of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21  strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with  the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to  eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic  status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected  at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing  of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups. Pregnant  women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts (birth, 3, 6,  9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through in-person screening  of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the 80 NCs. The  screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within six months of  the birthday that qualified them for the sample were selected for  inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of 8,347  participants were identified through the screening. Of the  eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed.</p>\n\n<p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the  child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found  to spend the most time taking car\ne of the child. Separate research  assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child  interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face  interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the  personal interview were administered a phone interview. Interviews  were conducted in Spanish, English, and Polish. In Wave 1 the complete  protocol was translated into Spanish and Polish. An interpreter was  hired for participants who spoke a language other than English,  Spanish, or Polish. Depending on the age and wave of data collection,  participants were paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other  incentives, such as free passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly  drawing prizes were also included.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For  example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking  traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,  delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and  self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also  interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,  parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental  health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment  (HOME)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME)  protocol was administered to the primary caregivers (PC) of the  subjects belonging to each of the age cohorts (0 to 18) composing Wave  1. For Cohort 18, the HOME interview was administered to both PCs and  subjects.  A total of 6,172 respondents completed the HOME inventory:  1,250 from Cohort 0, 995 from Cohort 3, 974 from Cohort 6, 821 from  Cohort 9, 816 from Cohort 12, 686 from Cohort 15, and 630 from Cohort  18. The semi-structured interview was conducted at the respondent's  home. The HOME inventory was originally created to measure the quality  and quantity of stimulation and support available to a child in the  home environment.  However, the PHDCN adaptation of the widely used  HOME inventory sought to obtain data that would also summarize the  physical conditions present both inside and outside of the subject's  residence. To capture the developmental environment composed of the  subject's home and neighborhood, additional questions were taken from  the Systematic Social Observation checklist (PROJECT ON HUMAN  DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): SYSTEMATIC SOCIAL  OBSERVATION CHECKLIST, WAVE 1, 1995 [ICPSR 13578]) and included as  part of the PHDCN version of the HOME inventory.</p>\n\n<p>The questions regarding the physical environment found in the  subject's house and neighborhood were completed by the interviewer.  These questions provided multiple responses and solicited information  such as the level of noise encountered in the home, the amount of  space within the house, the condition of the houses and other  buildings on the block, and the volume of traffic on the streets. For  Cohorts 0 and 18, the HOME inventory only evaluated the physical state  of the subject's home and neighborhood. The interview for Cohorts 3,  6, 9, 12, and 15 contained additional, age-appropriate questions  designed to observe the developmental environment of the subject.  These questions were administered to the subject's primary caregiver  and offered only two responses--yes or no. These questions sought to  identify whether or not certain educational opportunities such as  trips to museums, live performances and access to materials such as  books, CD's, and board games were available to the subject at  home. The HOME inventory also sought to determine whether these  opportunities and materials were made available to the children at  school if they were not available at home. The HOME inventory further  sought to obtain information regarding other aspects of the subject's  cognitive stimulation, the responsivity of the primary\ncaregiver  toward the subject, positive and negative interactions between the  primary caregiver and the subject, as well as the presence or absence of a model of positive social behavior for the subject.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The HOME inventory maintains a core set of  variables across the various cohort files.
