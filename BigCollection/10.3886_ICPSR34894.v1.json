However, aggregate data limits HAB's ability to respond to inquiries from Congress and other stakeholders regarding the ADAP program. To address this limitation, HAB has developed a new data reporting system, the ADAP Data Report (ADR). The ADR will enable HAB to evaluate the impact of the ADAP program on a national level. The ADR will allow HAB to characterize the individuals using the program, describe the ADAP-funded services being used, and delineate the costs associated with these services.</p>\n\n<p>ADAPs will begin collecting data for the ADR in October 2012.
