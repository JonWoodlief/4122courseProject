Respondents from the Washington, DC, metropolitan area and Virginia   were asked a series of questions to ascertain their level of interest   and involvement in Redskins football, and whether they thought of the   Redskins as the District of Columbia's team. A major\nportion of the   survey focused on whether the Redskins should move to a new stadium,   whether the stadium should be built in the District, in the Maryland   suburbs, or in the northern Virginia suburbs, whether tax money should   be used to help build the stadium, and whether inducements like tax   breaks should be used by state and local governments to encourage the   Redskins to build the stadium in one locale over another. Respondents   were asked about the negotiations between the governor of Virginia and   the owner of the Redskins over building a new stadium in northern   Virginia, whether the Redskins owner should keep the team in the   District even if he could get the state of Virginia to help build the   newly-proposed stadium, and whether a new Redskins stadium in northern   Virginia would help or hurt the area financially. The survey also asked   respondents to speculate on whether the Redskins would eventually build   their new stadium outside the District, and to comment on whether the   Redskins should change their team name. In addition, respondents were   asked for their impressions of George Bush, Bill Clinton, the owner of   the Redskins, and several government officials involved in the stadium   proposal. Background information on respondents includes party   preference, voter registration status, home ownership, education, age,   household composition, employment status, Hispanic origin and race,  household income, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George H.W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"professional sports"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sports"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tax revenues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
