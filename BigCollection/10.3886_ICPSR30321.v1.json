The case review study was implemented through four private non-profit legal services agencies in New York City that provide free legal representation to domestic violence victims in civil proceedings including custody and visitation litigation. Staff at each agency reviewed computerized case lists and asked attorneys to ide\nntify cases that included custody evaluations. A total of 69 cases involving custody or visitation issues that were litigated and resolved between 1997 and 2007 were identified for inclusion in the study. The custody and visitation cases were either part of a divorce proceeding in Supreme Court or resulted from petitions by one or both parents in Family Court. Court orders appointing the evaluators, custody evaluations, and settlement agreements or final orders were pulled from the attorney case files, copied, and redacted to remove all identifying information about the parties and other private individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Paralegals entered into a database the basic, non-interpretive legal and demographic information in the case file, such as the type of court in which the case was heard, arrests and criminal court actions, and family court proceedings and outcomes. They also provided an account of the abuse based on these records and the attorney's notes. From these descriptions, cases were given a domestic violence severity rating in each of four domains: physical abuse; threats; psychological, social, and financial abuse; and stalking.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the Case Review study (Part 1), a Coding Scale for Custody Evaluations with Domestic Violence (DV) Allegations was developed for rating the characteristics of the custody evaluations and the court outcomes.
