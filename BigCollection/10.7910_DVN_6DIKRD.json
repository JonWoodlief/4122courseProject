The use of dried blood spots (DBS) offers a practical collection method suitable for a wide variety of analytes. A small volume of whole blood can be obtained rapidly through a minimally invasive heel- or finger-stick using a disposable safety lancet. Once dried, the samples require no further processing, are stable for months or longer, pose minimal risk of disease transmission, and are easy to ship. DBS are often used in demographic health surveys to assess infectious disease status in vulnerable populations. These samples can be used to screen biomarkers of micronutrient deficiency (MND) and inflammation. We recently described a multiplexed immunoarray, the Q-plex human micronutrient array, which can simultaneously quantify seven biomarkers related to MND, inflammation and malarial antigenemia using plasma. In this work, we present a protocol for preparing eluates from DBS samples and their measurement using a modified protocol for this new tool. We evaluated the concordance of analyte concentrations from a panel ninety samples of DBS prepared from anticoagulated venous blood and paired K2-EDTA plasma. The results show high correlation between DBS eluates and wet plasma for five of the six analytes screened, suggesting the Q-plex human micronutrient array can be used with DBS samples, but also highlighting that anticoagulants can have a negative effects on some test components."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-08-07"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Measurement of micronutrient deficiency associated biomarkers in dried blood spots multiplexed immuno array"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"KALNOKY, MICHAEL"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-08-07"}]}},"files":[{"description":"raw data","label":"Dataverse EDTA 90 repeat 5-2018 assays%2c summary results (1).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":140249,"dataFile":{"id":3204807,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6DIKRD/PUAQHT","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6DIKRD/PUAQHT","filename":"Dataverse EDTA 90 repeat 5-2018 assays%2c summary results (1).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":8830,"description":"raw data","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:165169911dc-edba84c276a7","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:wPds/STWyGN6pqvUFgDDmA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f16cb46540b7ef8a81491a4fb9672655","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f16cb46540b7ef8a81491a4fb9672655"}}}]}}}
