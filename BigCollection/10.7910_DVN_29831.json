The population used in this study consisted of 5,415 undergraduate students who studied in 3rd and 4th year, first semester, 2010 at Suan Dusit Rajabhat University. The samples of this research were 372 students. Data-gathering instruments were check list, rating scale and open ended questionnaires which its a reliability coefficient was 0.85. The R software was applied to analyze the percentage, mean, standard deviation, t-test and one-way ANOVA. The results of this study were as follows: Most of students used notebook computer in learning, communication and entertainment. In the learning aspect, most of students used notebook computer for searching from internet such as Google and Yahoo. In the communication aspect, most of students used notebook computer to communicate with parents, teachers, and friends by internet such as e-mail and Suan Dusit Rajabhat UniversityÃ¢ÂÂs website. In the entertainment aspect, most of students used notebook computer to chat such as MSN and Skype. For comparing behaviors of notebook computer using of students of different faculties and years were as follows: there were statistically significant difference among different faculties at 0.05 levels whereas behaviors of notebook computer using of students different years were not significant."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Notebook"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Suan Dusit Rajabhat University"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A Study of Behaviors of Notebook Computer Using of Undergraduate Students  at Suan Dusit Rajabhat University"}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Prisana Mutchima"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Suan Dusit Rajabhat University"},"producerURL":{"typeName":"producerURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://dusithost.dusit.ac.th/~prisana_mut/"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Suan Dusit Rajabhat University"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.dusit.ac.th"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-04-02"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-04-02"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Notebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":57121,"categories":["paper"],"dataFile":{"id":2548845,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/29831/KVWHSX","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/29831/KVWHSX","filename":"Notebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":321804,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:303674","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1acce96e3fae08d0da436765b821b03e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1acce96e3fae08d0da436765b821b03e"}}}]}}}
