Among Blacks and Latinos, women participate at vastly higher rates than men; many Blacks participate at higher rates than Whites; and the relationship between age and participation is both not linear and varies by race and gender. Survey research is unable to capture the true rela- tionship between demographics and participation, on account of survey bias and, more importantly, the non-linearity of eects. As a result, theories of participation, like the dominant resources-based models, have been built on faulty premises and tested with inadequate data. Our evidence calls for a renewed eort to understand election participation by utilizing large datasets, by being attentive to linearity assumptions, and by returning to theory."}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-12-08"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-12-13"}]}},"files":[{"description":"In this brief analysis, we use a new dataset of two million voter registration records to demonstrate that gender, race, and age do not correlate with political participation in ways that previous research has shown.","label":"race_gender_research_note_v2 5.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":54492,"categories":["Papers"],"dataFile":{"id":2338145,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"race_gender_research_note_v2 5.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":786988,"description":"In this brief analysis, we use a new dataset of two million voter registration records to demonstrate that gender, race, and age do not correlate with political participation in ways that previous research has shown.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:78596","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a1cdb1775737cc933762c58e2ca261b8","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a1cdb1775737cc933762c58e2ca261b8"}}}]}}}
