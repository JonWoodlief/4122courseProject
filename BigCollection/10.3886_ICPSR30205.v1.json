Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Barack Obama and his handling of the presidency, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the federal budget deficit, immigration, and the economy.  Respondents were asked their opinons about regulation of the offshore oil industry, the economy, the Tea Party movement, and Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan.  Respondents were asked whether they supported or opposed stricter federal regulations on greenhouse gasses and increasing federal oversight of the way the oil industry drills offshore. Opinions were collected on whether the Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, should be confirmed, whether she should state her position on abortion, and whether she should indicate how she would have ruled in past cases before the court. Respondents were also asked whether they supported the Tea Party political movement, and whether the Tea Party, Democratic Party, or the Republican Party best represented their personal values, the needs of people like them, and best understood the economic problems of people in the country. Other topics included the national economy, and voter behavior in the United States House of Representatives election. Several questions addressed federal spending, the national economic situation and whether respondents thought criminal charges should be sought in the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, political philosophy, party affiliation, education level, religious preference, household income, and whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Afghanistan

To achieve greater consistency and reduce the chance of large weights, ABC News in 2007 tested and evaluated iterative weighting, commonly known as raking or rim weighting, in which the sample is weighted sequentially to Census targets on variable at a time, continuing until the optimum distribution across variables (again, age, race, sex, and education) is achieved. ABC News adopted rim weighting in January 2008. Weights are capped at lows of 0.2 and highs of 6."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"ABC NewsWashington Post Monthly Poll, June 2010","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":40042,"dataFile":{"id":2651119,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"ABC NewsWashington Post Monthly Poll, June 2010","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
