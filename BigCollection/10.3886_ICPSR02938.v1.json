The survey instrument was  administered to former and currently-serving VPSOs from October 1998  to January 1999. Information was collected on the respondent's  motivation for becoming a VPSO, length of time working as a VPSO, if  the respondent was satisfied with the pay, retirement benefits,  training, housing, and safety, if it was difficult for the respondent  to enforce laws against relatives, the respondent's perception of the  community's support and expectations, and their job-related stresses,  role conflicts, duties, and demands. Those who had left the job were  also asked about their post-VPSO employment.

These officers usually serve in a geographically  isolated Alaska Native village by themselves and are sometimes an hour  or more away by air from back-up law enforcement. VPSOs are expected  to be on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in order to deal with the  problems that arise in what are some of the most violence- and  accident-prone places in the nation. Since 1983, the first year for  which adequate records are available, turnover in the VPSO program had  averaged 36 percent per year. This study was designed to examine the  high turnover rate in the VPSO program. The goals were to help guide  the design of future delivery of public safety services to Alaska  villages and to add to what was a limited understanding of policing in  places with tiny populations. Previous researchers had commented on  the relative lack of research about police departments with very few  officers. Of the research that had been conducted, officer turnover  had been mentioned as a prime difficulty in these small  departments. The present study builds upon that research by examining  both the amount of turnover in the VPSO program as well as the factors thought to be associated with it."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The survey instrument was administered to former  and currently-serving VPSOs from October 1998 to January 1999. Two  slightly different versions of the questionnaire, primarily involving  changes in verb tense, were developed for currently employed officers  and for formerly employed officers. The survey questions were  developed from three different perspectives: (1) general police  research that focused on the role of job stress and dissatisfaction  with salary and benefits, (2) research on the problems faced by rural  police officers, and (3) research regarding the difficulties of  policing Alaska Native communities using Alaska Native  employees. Draft copies of the survey were sent to the regional  nonprofit corporation VPSO coordinators for their comments on the form  and content of the questions. The draft of the survey was also  examined by Alaska State Troopers affiliated with the VPSO  program. The former VPSOs were offered $10 as incentive to  participate, and both current and former VPSOs were offered a chance  to win a $500 gift certificate to Wal-Mart for their participation. A  total of 109 surveys were mailed out to former VPSOs during the first  week of November 1998. Six weeks after the first mailing, a reminder  letter was s\nent and follow-up telephone interviews were attempted with  nonrespondents. A second reminder letter was sent to nonrespondents in  mid-January 1999. About half of the surveys of the 75 current officers  were administered at one of two regional training sessions held in  October 1998. The remainder of the surveys were mailed to the current  VPSOs at the beginning of November 1998. A reminder letter was sent to  the current VPSOs in mid-December 1998 combined with follow-up telephone calls."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Information was collected on the respondent's  motivation for becoming a VPSO, length of time working as a VPSO, if  the respondent was satisfied with the pay, retirement benefits,  training, housing, and safety, if it was difficult for the respondent  to enforce laws against relatives, the respondent's perception of the  community's support and expectations, and their job-related stresses,  role conflicts, duties, and demands.
