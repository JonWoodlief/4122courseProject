The primary  objectives of the study were (1) to identify the scope of gang  migration nationally, (2) to describe the nature of gang migration,  (3) to assess the impact of gang migration on destination cities, and  (4) to describe the current law enforcement responses to the migration  of gangs and identify those that appeared to be most effective for  various types of migration. Two phases of data collection were  used. The major objective of the initial phase was to identify cities  that had experienced gang migration (Part 1). This was accomplished by  distributing a brief mail questionnaire in 1992 to law enforcement  agencies in cities identified as potential gang or gang migration  sites. The second major phase of data collection involved in-depth  telephone interviews with law enforcement officers in cities that had  experienced gang migration in order to develop descriptions of the  nature of migration and police responses to it (Part 2). For Part 1,  information was collected on the year migration started, number of  migrants in the past year, factors that deter gang migration, number  of gang members, names of gangs, ethnic distribution of gang members  and their drug market involvement, number of gang homicides, number of  1991 gang \"drive-bys\", and if gangs or narcotics were specified in the  respondent's assignment. For Part 2, information was collected on the  demographics of gang members, the ethnic percentage of drug gang  members and their involvement in distributing specific drugs, and the  influence of gang migrants on local gang and crime situations in terms  of types and methods of crime, drug distribution activities,  technology/equipment used, and targets of crime. Information on  patterns of gang migration, including motivations to migrate, drug gang  migration, and volume of migration, was also collected. Local responses  to gang migration covered information sources, department policies  relative to migration, gang specialization in department, approaches  taken by the department, and information exchanges and coordination among local, state, and federal agencies."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"While gang migration had been mentioned with  increasing frequency in state legislative task force investigations,  conferences, and law enforcement accounts at the local, state, and  federal levels, the evidence cited rarely reflected a systematic  assessment of the prevalence, nature, and consequences of gang  migration. It became critical to determine how the migration of gang  members from traditional urban centers affected the emergence of  street gangs in mid-sized and smaller cities throughout the nation. A  migratory population of gang members may require different prevention  and intervention strategies than an indigenous population of gang  members. Different collaborative efforts among law enforcement  agencies may be necessary. Finally, if various motivations for  migration\nare observed in different settings, different responses by  law enforcement agencies may be appropriate. This study was the first  attempt to investigate gang migration systematically and on a national  level.

The researchers obtained membership lists of gang investigator  associations and solicited candidate municipalities from law  enforcement contacts across the country. The primary agency  responsible for policing each city was identified from the 1991  National Directory of Law Enforcement Administrators. If the  municipality contracted police services to an agency other than the  local police department, this agency was contacted by telephone to  identify the appropriate respondent. Telephone follow-up procedures  were instituted for cities that had not responded to the survey one  month subsequent to the second mailing. Once the cities that  experienced gang migration were identified, the second major phase of  the data collection was to conduct in-depth telephone interviews with  law enforcement officers in those cities in order to develop  descriptions of the nature of migration and police responses to  it.
