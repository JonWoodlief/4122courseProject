Often when a decision  is made is as critical as the decision itself. The principal  investigators (PIs) posit a dynamic model of strategic position  announcement, based in part on signaling theories of legislative  politics. Specifically, they suggest that members who receive s\ntrong,  clear signals from constituents, interest groups, and policy leaders,  that do not conflict with their own personal preferences about which  position to take, will announce their positions earlier. Those with  weak or conflicting signals will seek more information from those same  constituents, interest groups, and policy leaders, delaying their  position announcement. The PIs test a number of these expectations by  examining data on when members of the United States House of  Representatives announced their support for or opposition to the North  American Free Trade Agreement. They also contrast the effects of  explanatory variables in the dynamic timing model with those of the  vote model, and find that a richer specification of the form of the  variables, interactions, and a larger set of variables explain the  timing decision. The research thus allows  analysts to interpret both the process leading up to the House action and the end state of that process."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legislative bodies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NAFTA"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"politicians"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"research models"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
