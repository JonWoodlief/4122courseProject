The study was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and  opinions about the 2000 presidential election. Respondents were asked  to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of  the presidency, as well as their opinions of both candidates, Vice  President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush. Those polled were  asked whether Bush and Gore would be able to lead the country  effectively and whether they would bring together or divide different  groups of Americans. The survey also queried respondents on the  legitimacy of the election, the way the Bush and Gore campaigns  handled the election, the way elections in the United States are run  and votes are counted, the need for election reforms, the electoral  college, and the effects of the election controversy on the  institution of the United States presidency. A number of questions  concentrated on Florida's vote recount. Those polled were asked whom  voters in Florida intended to vote for and whether the vote count in  Florida was fair and accurate. Respondents also commented on the way  the courts had handled the lawsuits dealing with the Florida vote, the  manual recounts of disputed votes in Florida, and the manual recounts  of all ballots in Florida. Their views were elicited on whom they  would rather see become president, how much confidence they had in the  vote counting, what voting method they used, when they thought the  outcome would finally be resolved, whether one of the candidates  should concede, and if so, who, and whether they approved of the  legislature naming its electors before the outcome had been  determined.
