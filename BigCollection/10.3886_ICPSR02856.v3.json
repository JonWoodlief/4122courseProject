Conducted in Chicago and New York City, the  survey was designed to assess the well-being of middle-aged, urban,  ethnic minority adults living in both hyper-segregated neighborhoods  and in areas with lower concentrations of minorities. Respondents'  views were sought on issues relevant to quality of life, including  health, childhood and family background, religion, race and ethnicity,  personal beliefs, work experiences, marital and close relationships,  financial situation, children, community involvement, and neighborhood  characteristics. Questions on health explored the respondents'  physical and emotional well-being, past and future attitudes toward  health, physical limitations, energy level and appetite, amount of  time spent worrying about health, and physical reactions to those  worries. Questions about childhood and family background elicited  information on family structure, the role of the parents with regard  to child rearing, parental education, employment status, and  supervisory responsibilities at work, the family financial situation  including experiences with the welfare system, relationships with  siblings, and whether as a child the respondent slept in the same bed  as a parent or adult relative. Questions on religion covered religious  preference, whether it is good to explore different religious  teachings, and the role of religion in daily decision-making.  Questions about race and ethnicity investigated respondents'  backgrounds and experiences as minorities, including whether  respondents preferred to be with people of the same racial group, how  important they thought it was to marry within one's racial or ethnic  group, citizenship, reasons for moving to the United States and the  challenges faced since their arrival, their nati\nve language, how they  would rate the work ethic of certain ethnic groups, their views on  race relations, and their experiences with discrimination. Questions  on personal beliefs probed for respondents' satisfaction with life and  confidence in their opinions. Respondents were asked whether they had  control over changing their life or their personality, and what age  they viewed as the ideal age. They also rated people in their late 20s  in the areas of physical health, contribution to the welfare and  well-being of others, marriage and close relationships, relationships  with their children, work situation, and financial situation.  Questions on work experiences covered respondents' employment status,  employment history, future employment goals, number of hours worked  weekly, number of nights away from home due to work, exposure to the  risk of accident or injury, relationships with coworkers and  supervisors, work-related stress, and experience with discrimination  in the workplace. A series of questions was posed on marriage and  close relationships, including marital status, quality and length of  relationships, whether the respondent had control over his or her  relationships, and spouse/partner's education, physical and mental  health, employment status, and work schedule. Questions on finance  explored respondents' financial situation, financial planning,  household income, retirement plans, insurance coverage, and whether  the household had enough money. Questions on children included the  number of children in the household, quality of respondents'  relationships with their children, prospects for their children's  future, child care coverage, and whether respondents had changed their  work schedules to accommodate a child's illness. Additional topics  focused on children's identification with their culture, their  relationships with friends of different backgrounds, and their  experiences with racism. Community involvement was another area of  investigation, with items on respondents' role in child-rearing,  participation on a jury, voting behavior, involvement in charitable  organizations, volunteer experiences, whether they made monetary or  clothing donations, and experiences living in an institutional setting  or being homeless. Respondents were also queried about their  neighborhoods, with items on neighborhood problems including racism,  vandalism, crime, drugs, poor schools, teenage pregnancy, the  existence of social networks, the frequency of contact with family  members, social interaction with neighbors, sense of community,  whether the respondent owned or rented their home, and the financial,  legal, and medical problems of family members. A final set of  questions sought respondents' assessments of their life and their  expectations for the future. Additional background information on respondents includes age, ethnicity, and gender."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"beliefs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community involvement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family relationships"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"midlife"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"minorities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhood characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhoods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"psychological wellbeing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social networks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"urban areas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR VI.
