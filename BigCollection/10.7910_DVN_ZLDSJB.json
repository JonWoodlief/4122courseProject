More than 70 percent of India's population lives in rural\r\nareas where the main occupation is agriculture. Indian agriculture is characterized by small farm holdings.\r\nThe average farm size is only 1.57 hectares. Around 93 percent of farmers have land holdings smaller\r\nthan 4 ha and they cultivate nearly 55 percent of the arable land. Due to diverse agro-climatic conditions\r\nin the country, a large number of agricultural items are produced. Crop diversification is intended to give\r\na wider choice in the production of a variety of crops in a given area so as to expand production related\r\nactivities on various crops and also to lessen risk. Crop diversification in India is generally viewed as a\r\nshift from traditionally grown less remunerative crops. Crop diversification and also the growing of large\r\nnumber of crops are practised in rain fed lands to reduce the risk factor of crop failures due to drought and\r\nless rains. Diversification originated from the word ‘Diverge’ which means to move or extend in a\r\ndifferent direction from a common point. Crop diversification is essential for an agricultural based\r\neconomy like Haryana to meet the cash needs of the family as well as to combat risk associated with\r\nmono-cropping. Moreover the state is facing problems of decreasing size of farm holdings, decreasing\r\ncultivable area, increasing soil salinity as well as rising water tables, imbalanced use of fertilizers and\r\nmicro-nutrient deficiency, harsh climate, low forest cover (3.52%), considerable area still under rain fed\r\nfarming (19%), lack of required processing and value addition facilities, storage constraints and off late\r\nshortage of labour for farming operations. All these factors are adversely affecting productivity\r\nenhancement. Traditionally diversification was used more in the context of a subsistence kind of farming,\r\nwherein farmers grew many crops on their farm. The household level food security as also risk was in\r\nimportant consideration in diversification. The farmers with smaller (< 2.0 hac.) farms do practice\r\ndiversified farming. On quite small holdings often fragmented farmers nation wide allocate their land\r\namong seasonal crops, fruits and vegetables ,dairy and perhaps poultry to maximise their household\r\nlabour utilization and income but the role of women in diversification is still not visible. Keeping all this\r\nin view preferential pattern of rural women for crop diversification was studied. The experiment was\r\ncarried in Bandaheri and Burak villages of Hisar II block of district Hisar, Haryana. Data were collected\r\nwith the help of structured interview schedule."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-08-10"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Arts and Humanities","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Rural Women"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Diversification in the Villages"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Preferential Pattern"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This article is originally published and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21013/jmss.v4.n1.p25"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Journals, IRA"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-08-10"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This article is originally published and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21013/jmss.v4.n1.p25","label":"IRAJMSS25.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":86775,"dataFile":{"id":2865541,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/ZLDSJB/7JGIRU","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZLDSJB/7JGIRU","filename":"IRAJMSS25.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":178015,"description":"This article is originally published and available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21013/jmss.v4.n1.p25","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:156a60eda3f-9454eba989d6","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"67aae2d9c101e63d9c635a99a7984e75","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"67aae2d9c101e63d9c635a99a7984e75"}}}]}}}
