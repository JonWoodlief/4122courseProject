The study was designed to provide (1) a 1990 cohort of clients to use as baseline for possible changes in treatment outcomes following increased funding to the national treatment system in the 1990s, (2) a before-to-after comparison to measure outcomes of treatment provided in 1990, (3) a follow-up of drug treatment clients five years after treatment to assess the level of sustained improvements in abstinence, and (4) a first look at multiple treatment episodes before and after treatment in a 1990 population.</p>\n<p>Part 1 is the Facility Director Interviews and covered topics such as facility staff and organization, revenue and charges, staff hours and compensation, costs, and program characteristics.</p>\n<p>Part 2 is the Client Records Abstractions Data, which examined the client records of 2,222 individuals discharged during 1989-1990.
