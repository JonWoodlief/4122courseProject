The focus of this data collection was the opinions of registered voters prior to and immediately following the first presidential debate held September 25, 1988. Registered voters polled prior to the first presidential debate were asked about the likelihood that they would vote in the November 1988 general election, whether they planned to watch the first presidential debate, for whom they would vote if the presidential election were held that day, and the strength of their support for this candidate. Immediately following the debate, 710 respondents were recontacted about whether they had watched the debate, which candidate had won, and for whom they would vote for if the presidential election were held that day.
