The identifying restrictions imposed in many of these  exercises have been criticized in the literature. This paper extends  this literature by showing that, if the SVAR includes one or more  variables that are efficient in the strong form of the efficient  market hypothesis, the identifying restrictions frequently imposed in  SVARs cannot be satisfied. The authors argue that this analysis will  likely apply to VARs that include variables that are consistent with  weaker forms of the efficient market hypothesis, especially when the  data are measured at the monthly or quarterly frequencies, as is frequently the case."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
