The data collected in  the 1992 and 1993 SIPP panels provide extensive background information  from which to determine the effects of welfare reform. Interviewing  the same households in the SPD will provide data covering the baseline  pre-reform period, the reform implementation period, and the  medium-term post-reform period. The data from SPD present estimates of  the economic status and activities of the population of the United  States. SPD provides monthly labor force data and, in addition,  supplies supplemental data on work experience, income, and noncash  benefits. Comprehensive work experience information is given on the  employment status, occupation, and industry of persons 15 years old  and over, as well as weeks worked and hours per week worked, reasons  for not working full-time, total income, and income  components. Information is available not only for persons currently in  the labor force but also for those who are outside the labor  force. Questions cover respondents' current desire for work, their  past work experience, and their intentions for job-seeking. SPD also  contains data covering nine noncash income sources: food stamps,  school lunch programs, employer-provided group health insurance plans,  employer-provided pension plans, personal health insurance, Medicaid,  Medicare, CHAMPUS or military health care, and energy assistance.  Basic demographic, social, and economic characteristics are supplied  for each member of the household surveyed, including age, sex, race,  ethnic origin, marital status, household relationship, education, and  veteran status. Limited data are provided on housing unit characteristics such as number of units in structure and tenure."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing units"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personal finances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public assistance programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"socioeconomic status"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"welfare reform"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"welfare services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work experience"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR I.A.4.

The first record type is Household, with 153 variables  in 37,830 records. The second type is Family, which has 68 variables  in 33,061 records. The Person record consists of 395 variables in  77,630 records. The entire dataset contains a total of 148,521  records. (2) The dataset is a calendar-year file for 1996 intended to  be\nused as a research file. Longitudinal analyses can be performed by  linking this dataset to the SURVEY OF INCOME AND PROGRAM PARTICIPATION  (SIPP), 1992 (ICPSR 2037) and SURVEY OF INCOME AND PROGRAM  PARTICIPATION (SIPP) 1993 PANEL, LONGITUDINAL FILE (ICPSR 2421) using  the following match keys: SIPP panel number, sample unit  identification number, person number, and entry address ID (SIPP-PNL,  PP-ID, PP-PNUM, and PP-ENTRY). (3) The data were collected using a  modified Current Population Survey March questionnaire. This file was  processed using programs for the March Current Population Survey  Demographic Supplement. These data have undergone limited editing and  review by the Census Bureau and should be used carefully. (4) Data on  employment and income refer to the preceding year, although  demographic data refer to the time of the survey. (5) The codebook is  provided as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
