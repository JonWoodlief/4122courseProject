It focuses on the measurement of the outcomes and impact of Phase III of the Campaign on children and their parents concerning illegal drug use among youth. It contains four rounds of Restricted Use Files and includes all NSPY respondents. The Restricted Use Files also contain extensive data on youth, parents, and the Campaign advertisements, as well as other reference files. In addition, NSPY contains Public Use Files which were released in September 2004.  The Public Use Files contain only the first three rounds of data and a subsample of respondents. Also, due to confidentiality reasons, the September 2004 Public Use File provides a limited set of variables about youth, and only a handful of variables about parents as it is not possible to link respondents across rounds using the Public Use Files, but it is possible using the Restricted Use Files. The survey was developed and implemented under contract to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Westat conducted the study in collaboration with the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and, for the first two years of the project, with the National Development and Research Institutes, Inc. (NDRI). NSPY Round 1 was conducted in three waves, covering the periods November 1999 through May 2000 (Wave 1), July 2000 through December 2000 (Wave 2), and January 2001 through June 2001 (Wave 3). NSPY Round 2, the first follow-up of the initial survey, was conducted in two waves covering the periods July 2001 through December 2001 (Wave 4) and January 2002 through June 2002 (Wave 5). NSPY Round 3, the second follow-up data collection, was conducted in two waves covering the periods July 2002 through December 2002 (Wave 6) and January 2003 through June 2003 (Wave 7). Finally, NSPY Round 4, the third follow-up data collection, was conducted in two waves covering the periods July 2003 through December 2003 (Wave 8) and January 2004 through June 2004 (Wave 9). Youths and their parents were selected for NSPY through a multistage, dual frame probability sample design. The sample was sele\ncted in a manner designed to provide an efficient and representative cross-section of American youth. In general, youths living in all types of residential housing units were eligible for the study; however, youths living in institutions, group homes, or dormitories were excluded."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign seeks to educate and enable America's youth to reject illegal drugs; to prevent youth from initiating the use of drugs, especially marijuana and inhalants; and to convince occasional users of these drugs to stop using them. The evaluation had four objectives: (1) to measure changes in drug-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in children and their parents; (2) to assess the relationship of the changes (in drug-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors), and their association with self-reported measures of media exposure; (3) to assess the association between parent's drug-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, and those of their children; and (4) to assess changes in the association between parent's drug-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors and those of their children."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NSPY employed a panel survey design with four rounds of data collection for youth and parents between November 1999 and June 2004. Round 1 of the NSPY is the recruitment phase of the study. It consists of three cross-sectional survey periods lasting about six months each. About 81,000 dwelling units were selected for the sample in Round 1 and approximately 8,100 youths and 5,600 parents were interviewed. Rounds 2 through 4 are the follow-up phases of the study. Round 2 included about 6,400 households from which approximately 6,500 youths and 4,600 parents were interviewed. Round 3 included about 5,950 households from which approximately 5,850 youths and 4,250 parents were interviewed. Round 4 included about 4,600 1-4 Introduction households from which approximately 4,850 youths and 3,600 parents were interviewed. The data generated by this design can be analyzed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The questionnaires were developed for Wave 1 of the National Survey of Parents and Youth and modified slightly for Wave 2. The Wave 2 versions are shown with footnotes to indicate where the Wave 1 instrument differed. There are four questionnaires. The first is a household screener. It comes in two parts. Part I was administered with paper and pencil, mostly at people's doorsteps. Its purpose was to establish the eligibility or ineligibility of a household. Part II of the screener was administered with a laptop computer. Its purpose was to select a sample of eligible youth and parents from each household. There are then three substantive questionnaires: one for children aged 9 to 11, one for adolescents and teens aged 12-18 (the \"Teen\" instrument), and one for parents. The child instrument is basically a shortened version of the teen instrument. It was made shorter because of the shorter attention spans of younger children and because of the difficulty of some of the concepts for them. The teen instrument covers the following topics: basic demographics; school and religion; media consumption; extra-curricular activities; personal usage of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants; expectations for future use of marijuana; feelings of self-efficacy to resist future offers of marijuana use; knowledge of friends' and classmates' use of marijuana; receipt of marijuana offers; family functioning; antisocial behavior of self and friends; approval/disapproval and perceived risk of marijuana and inhalants; perceived ease of parental discussion on drugs and perceived parental reactions to personal drug use; past discussions about drugs with parents, friends, and others; awareness of drug-related media stories and advertising; recollection and assessment of specific Campaign-sponsored antidrug advertisements on television and radio; Internet usage; and p\narticipation in drug education classes and programs. The parent instrument covers the following topics: media consumption; communication with child; monitoring of child; family functioning; knowledge about child's use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants; personal participation in community drug prevention activities; awareness of drug-related media stories and advertising; recollection and assessment of specific Campaign-sponsored antidrug advertisements on television and radio; personal usage of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants; basic demographics; and education, income and religion. When parents were being asked about their children, each question was targeted to a specific sample child and repeated for every sampled child in the household. Other questions that were not about their children were only asked once."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"adolescents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"detoxification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug dependence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"media influence"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"news media"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"parents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"substance abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"youths"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.C.1.
