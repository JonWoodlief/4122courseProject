Here we find that citizens in China (n = 3000) and the United States (n = 3007) have strong preferences over the design of international climate agreements, and contributions of other countries to the global effort. However, contrary to what standard accounts of international politics would predict, a survey-embedded experiment in which respondents were randomly exposed to different information on other countries’ behavior showed that information on other countries failing to reduce their emissions does not undermine support for how international agreements are designed. While other factors still make large emission cuts challenging, these results suggest that the Paris approach per se is not posing a problem."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Beiser-McGrath, Liam F."},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-12-20"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"replication_materials.zip","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"ncc_replication","version":1,"datasetVersionId":148701,"dataFile":{"id":3345051,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"replication_materials.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":9399515,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:16857109ebe-526b41ce7671","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7168b7646a13199f868234e4de7e68ba","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7168b7646a13199f868234e4de7e68ba"}}}]}}}
