The researchers investigated promising approaches for  dealing with child abuse and also probed for areas of weakness that  are in need of improvement. Data were collected from 122 law  enforcement agencies on topics including interagency reporting and  case screening procedures, the existence and organizational location  of specialized units for conducting child abuse investigations, actual  procedures for investigating various types of child abuse cases,  factors that affect the decision to arrest in physical and sexual  abuse cases, the scope and nature of interagency cooperative  agreements practices and relations, the amount of training received by  agency personnel, and ways to improve agency responses to child abuse and neglect cases."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Until the mid-1960s, the police handled most  cases of child abuse and neglect, but only a small fraction of all  cases--usually those involving severe maltreatment or death--came to  their attention. What happened in the family was regarded as largely  a private matter, and there were no laws requiring the reporting of  abuse. However, with the discovery of the \"battered child syndrome\"  by the medical community and subsequently by the mass media, child  abuse came to be defined as a social problem needing social  intervention and treatment. Recognizing that law enforcement agencies  can play a central role in protecting abused and neglected children,  an increasing number of states have amended their child abuse laws and  procedures to provide for a greater police presence in child abuse  cases. This study was conducted to document municipal and county law  enforcement agencies' increased responsibilities for dealing with  child abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse and exploitation, and to  identify emerging police practices. The researchers investigated  promising approaches for dealing with child abuse and also probed for areas of weakness that are in need of improvement."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Letters soliciting participation in the study were  sent to the chiefs of 89 municipal and 57 county law enforcement  agencies in the spring of 1988. In each participating agency, the  respondent was a person designated by the chief, which in most  departments was the sergeant or lieutenant in charge of the child  abuse squad or unit. In small departments, the specialized  investigator who handled most of the child abuse cases tended to be  assigned. Data collection was conducted by means of telephone  interviews. The survey instrument was designed to (1) describe  existing policies and procedures for identifying, investigating, and  otherwise handling cases of abuse and neglect, (2) explore the formal  and informal interagency cooperative arrangements for dealing with  abuse, and (3) identify promising departmental and individual  strategies for dealing with physical and sexual offenses against  children. The majority of questions were of a \"yes/no\"  format. Interviews took approximately one hour. In addition to the  interview information, the researchers requested written copies of  agency policies and statistical data on 1987 cases and their disposition."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The researchers collected information about  interagency reporting and case screening procedures, the existence and  organizational location of specialized units for conducting child  abuse investigations, actual procedures for investigating various  types of child abuse cases, factors that affect the decision to arrest  in physical and sexual abuse cases, the scope and nature of  interagency cooperative agreements practices and relations, the amount  of training received by agency personnel, and ways to improve agency responses to child abuse and neglect cases."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arrest procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"case processing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child neglect"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement agencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police response"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policies and procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
