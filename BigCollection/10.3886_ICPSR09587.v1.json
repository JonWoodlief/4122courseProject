The principal investigators sought to determine (1) whether electronic   monitoring systems relieved some of the burdens associated with manual   monitoring of home detention, such as making telephone calls and field   visits, (2) how home detention affected the lifestyles of offenders,   (3) whether the methods of monitoring influenced offender behavior   during the program, (4) how electronic monitoring differed from manual   monitoring in terms of supervision of the offenders, (5) how offenders   reacted to electronic monitoring, (6) how offenders' families reacted   to electronic monitoring, and (7) whether the method of monitoring   influenced the probability of an arrest or subsequent contact with the   criminal justice system after release from the program. Part 1 contains   demographic information, such as age, race, marital status, number of   children, living arrangements, employment, and education for each   offender. Also included is information on the offense leading to the   current case, including numbers and types of charges and convictions   for both felonies and misdemeanors, recommendations and judicial   disposition for the current case, and information on the criminal   history of the offender. Part 2 contains data from the intake interview   with the offender, such as information on the offender's family, living   arrangements, education, employment, past alcohol and drug use, and   expectations for the home detention program and monitoring procedures.   Part 3 contains information collected in the exit interview and is   similar in content to Part 2. Part 4 contains information on the   program delivery (type of release from the program, violations of the   program, results of tests for alcohol and drug use, errand time,   payment, contacts with offenders, and the characteristics and results   of the contacts with electronically monitored offenders). Part 5 is a   check of criminal histories of offenders for at least one year after  their release from the program."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alternatives to institutionalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"electronic monitoring"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"felony offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"house arrest"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"misdemeanor offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"supervised liberty"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
