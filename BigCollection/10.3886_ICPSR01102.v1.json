The technical statutory references corresponding to\nthe data   are not part of the data set itself, but are available from the   authors. The principals do not warrant that the data are definitive,   particularly as pertains to voter registration, for three reasons.   First, state statute is not always unambiguous, so that in certain   instances judgments based on other sources were required. Second,   judicial decisions can affect how registration and election laws are   implemented, and it is not clear that each relevant judicial decision   has been identified. Third, apart from state statute and judicial   decisions, actual administrative practice can vary from state to state   and also within states--such variation in administrative practice is   not reflected in the data. Since the principals intend to update the   data set in the future, please forward any corrections, suggestions, or   queries directly to either of them.
