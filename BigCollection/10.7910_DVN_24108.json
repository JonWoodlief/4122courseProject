Echinochloa crus-galli is one of the most problematic and competitive weeds in direct-seeded rice systems. Because of concerns about excessive herbicide use, there is an interest in developing cultural weed management strategies. However, the design of such strategies requires a better understanding of the weed response to crop density, nutrition, and water regime. A study was therefore conducted in pots to determine the effect of water (flooded and aerobic), nitrogen (N) fertilization (0, 100, and 200 kg N/ha), and rice density [0, 4 rice plants (~20 kg seed/ha), and 16 rice plants (~80 kg seed/ha)] on the growth and reproduction of E. crus-galli. When grown alone, the growth and seed production of E. crus-galli were higher in flooded conditions than in aerobic conditions. However, no such differences were observed when E. crus-galli was grown with rice interference. E. crus-galli growth and seed production increased with increases in N rate. Irrespective of water regime and N rate, the growth and seed production of E. crus-galli declined with increases in rice density. At 100 kg N/ha, for example, E. crus-galli shoot biomass and seed production decreased by 84-86% and 82-87%, respectively, when grown with 16 rice plants compared with its growth\nwithout rice interference. The results suggest that growth and seed production of E. crus-galli can be greatly reduced by increasing rice seeding rate. However, there is a need to involve other weed management strategies to achieve complete control of E. crus-galli and other weed species."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Aerobic rice system"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Crop interference"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Leaf area"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Weed competition"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Weed management"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: null  Type: CESD  Notes: ;"},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Crop Protection"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Elsevier"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/crop-protection"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://cdn.elsevier.com/cover_img/30406.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jean Sabado"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-01-03"},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-06"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-11"}}]},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Balasubramanian, V., Hill, J.E., 2002.
