In 1990, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention (OJJDP) launched a demonstration program to develop boot  camp models for juveniles and to test the feasibility and  appropriateness of their implementation. In September 1991, three  groups received awards to develop and implement boot camps as  intermediate sanctions: the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas in  Cleveland, Ohio, the Colorado Division of Youth Services in Denver,  Colorado, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Mobile,  Alabama. Simultaneously, the National Institute of Justice sponsored  an evaluation of the implementation of the demonstration programs,  focusing on the experiences of youths who entered the program during  the first year of operation, from 1992 to 1993. This collection  contains data from the program evaluation conducted on these three  boot camps during the first year. The core of the assessment was a  management information system that captured administrative data as the  offenders progressed through the demonstration program. At intake,  researchers collected demographic, criminal, and family and social  information. Demographic information collected at intake includes age,  race, education, and employment. Criminal data covers criminal  history, current offense, and case information, while family and  social history variables include whether the youths' parents had a  criminal record, whether their family received public assistance, and  whether they had delinquent friends, delinquent siblings, discipline  problems at home or school, or a history of psychological problems.  At the beginning and end of the boot camp term, staff rated the  youths' performance on educational and behavioral measures. The  youths were also surveyed about the rules of boot camp, their opinions  of instructors, and their self-esteem, drug and alcohol use, and  criminal behavior. At the end of the first 90 days (the residential  period), data were collected on the date of graduation, infractions  during boot camp, honors or awards, and special services  received. Five months after graduation, youths were evaluated on their  aftercare experiences.

Simultaneously, the National Institute of Justice sponsored  an evaluation of the implementation of the demonstration programs,  focusing on the experiences of youths who entered the program during  the first year of operation, from 1992 to 1993. The evaluation sought  to address the following research questions: (1) To what extent do  juveniles in boot camps receive the services prescribed for them? (2)  What is the recidivism rate of the juveniles in the boot camp group as  compared with that of the control group? (3) What short-term benefits,  such as educational or vocational training, employment, or  restitution, result from participation in the program? (4) Are the boot camps cost effective?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study was designed to be a process evaluation  and not an impact evaluation.

Family and social history variables include whether the  youths' parents had a criminal record, whether their family received  public assistance, and whether they had delinquent friends, delinquent  siblings, discipline problems at home or school, or a history of  psychological problems. Criminal history data were collected on prior  sentence, filing complaint date, sentence date, and offense status.  Upon exiting the camp, data on infraction type, reason for exiting  camp, aftercare placement, and any new sentence were recorded. For the  aftercare program, data were collected on the date released from boot  camp to aftercare, type of educational program and counseling received  during aftercare, types of serious disciplinary infractions, and  length of new sentence. At program completion, data were gathered on  program completion status, reasons for dropping out, charges, outcome,  and placement. In Cleveland and Mobile education data were recorded on  reading, spelling, and math scores at the beginning and end of the  program. Cleveland also collected baseline data on education  completed, youth employment, type of work the youths expected to do as  adults, behavior with close friends, behavior of close friends, and  drug use. Physical fitness data, including number of push-ups,  sit-ups, and running time at the beginning and end of the program,  were also gathered in Cleveland. In all\nthree sites, staff were asked  to rate the youths with regard to respecting authority, maintaining  self-control, acting responsibly, working well with others, and  maintaining their physical appearance.
