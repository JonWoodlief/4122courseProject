There was also a focus on the differences reported by male and female students in science and humanities concentrations.\r\n<br /><br />  Students were randomly selected in each of four categories: Females and males who had indicated plans to concentrate in a humanities or a science field on their college applications. In addition, students were selected who had participated in two programs offered by Radcliffe College designed to encourage females interested in science. Questionnaires were sent to these students in the fall of 1992, and 66 were returned. Interviews were scheduled and completed for 47 students during their first or second year (Time 1); they ranged in length from 45 to 90 minutes. During their junior year, a follow-up questionnaire was sent to the 66 students who had originally sent back questionnaires. Questionnaires were returned by 55 students and interviews were conducted during their senior years for 52 students (Time 2).<br /><br />  Questionnaires were used to obtain demographic and family background information, and to determine important factors in choosing a college major and important influences on their choice of college major and future careers. In-depth interviews probed participants' reflections on their experiences at Harvard and Radcliffe, how well their hopes and expectations had been met, what could be done better, experiences with professors and other students, experiences of discrimination and frustration, study habits, what they expect to be doing in 5, 10, and 15-20 years, and how they would advise an incoming student.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds all paper questionnaires and audiotaped interviews as original records. In addition, the coded questionnaire data are available in machine-readable form and the interview transcripts are available as computer text files.  <br/><br /><b>Audio Data Availability Note:</b> This study contains audio data that have been digitized.
