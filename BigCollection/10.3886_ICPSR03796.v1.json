It examined  the effects of police arrest policies and incarceration policies on  communities in 30 neighborhoods in Baltimore. Specifically, the study  addressed the question of whether aggressive arrest and incarceration  policies negatively impacted social organization and thereby reduced  the willingness of area residents to engage in informal social  control, or collective efficacy. Changes in arrest and incarceration  practices and in structural attributes of neighborhoods were measured  over a number of years. Previous studies assessed the effects of  coercion on crime and fear of crime but not on community organization  or collective efficacy. This study also examined the purported  beneficial effects of these arrest and incarceration policies (e.g., crime reduction)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data for this study came from three  sources. One source was CRIME CHANGES IN BALTIMORE, 1970-1994 (ICPSR  2352). Aggregate community-level data on demographics, socioeconomic  attributes, and crime rates covering the period 1980 to 1992 were  taken from Part 6 of ICPSR 2352, CRIME RATES AND CENSUS DATA FOR ALL  BALTIMORE NEIGHBORHOODS, 1970-1992. Part 9 of ICPSR 2352, SURVEY OF  RESIDENTS IN 30 NEIGHBORHOODS, 1994, provided data from interviews  with 704 residents of these neighborhoods about community attachment,  cohesiveness, participation, satisfaction, and experiences with crime  and self-protection. The second source of data was the Baltimore  Police Department, which provided incident-level offense and arrest  data for 1987 and 1992. The offense data included the type of offense  and street address where it occurred, and the arrest data included the  type of charge and the street address whe\nre the arrest was made.  Arrest and offense sites were located within the neighborhood where  the incident happened. For this study, offenses and charges were  grouped into four categories: drugs, violence, property, and public  order. There were potential problems with the spatial identification  of arrests. The arrest location may not represent where the crime  occurred. The third source of data was the Maryland Department of  Public Safety and Corrections, which provided data on all of the  admissions to and releases from prisons in neighborhoods in Baltimore  City and Baltimore County in 1987, 1992, and 1994. Each record  included the admission date, release date, the charges for which the  person was incarcerated, and the person's address at the time of  admission or release. As with the arrest data, these addresses were  used to associate individuals with the appropriate neighborhood in  Baltimore City. A potential problem with the corrections data was  incomplete data on admissions and releases due to missing address  data. Corrections Department personnel estimated that almost 50 percent of admissions and releases did not have address information."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Resident survey variables include answers to  questions about different aspects of residents' neighborhoods, such as  physical appearance, problems, crime and safety issues, and level of  satisfaction with and involvement in their neighborhoods.

Blocks were  selected based on the following criteria: (1) 1981 physical assessment  data were available for the block, (2) the reverse telephone directory  listed residential phones on that block, (3) there were at least 12  residential households with phones on that block, and (4) the  telephone listings were not dominated by phones in large apartment  buildings.
