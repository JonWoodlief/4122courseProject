The death records provide demographic data on the decedent and   information on the circumstances of death (location, time, underlying   causes, and other health conditions at time of death) and use of   medical facilities in the preceding year. Additional issues addressed   in the informant questionnaire were health care sought and provided in   the last year of life, risk factors associated with premature death,   socioeconomic status and mortality, and reliability of selected items   reported on the death certificate.

(2) Part 1, a hierarchical file, has two   levels of records. The first level, which provides one record for each   of the decedents in this study, contains information from death   certificates and the informant questionnaire. The second level c\nontains   data from health care facilities as collected in the Facility Abstract   Records (FARS). Each decedent may have up to six facility records, one   for each health care facility entered in the last year of life. Each   health care facility record can accommodate up to 20 episodes of care   received in that facility. Each episode of care has 17 variables   covering diagnosis, procedures, and length of stay. Of the decedents in   this study, 12,275 have one or more facility-level records.
