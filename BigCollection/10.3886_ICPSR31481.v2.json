Interviewing began on August 12, 2008, and ended on October 29, 2008. The survey instrument included questions about political behavior and attitudes as well as personal experiences in immigration to the United States. Topics include attitudes toward government, politics and political issues, extent of political involvement, party affiliation, sources of political information, voting behavior, health and financial status, racial and ethnic identification, linked fate and discrimination, and religious and ethnic social networks. The overall length of the interview was approximately 29 minutes. The NAAS includes adults in the United States who identify any family background from countries in Asia, exclusive of countries classified as the Middle East. Survey interviews were conducted in eight languages (English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Japanese, and Hindi) -- chosen according to the interviewee's preference -- and yielded sample sizes of at least 500 adult Asian American residents in the six largest national-origin groups. The final breakdown was 1,350 Chinese, 1,150 Asian Indian, 719 Vietnamese, 614 Korean, 603 Filipino, and 541 Japanese origin respondents, with 182 additional respondents who are either from other countries in Asia, or who identify as multi-racial or multi-ethnic. Overall, 40 percent of the sample chose English as their preferred language for the interview. The sample is weighted, using a raking procedure, to reflect the balance of gender, nativity, citizenship status, and educational attainment of the six largest national-origin groups in the United S\ntates, as well as the proportion of these national-origin groups within each state.

The largest number of cases were completed interviews drawn from a random selection of respondents in a listed sample of high-probability Asian Americans.  This listed sample was drawn from a commercial database of voter registration and marketing, with ethnic propensity classifications based on ethnic names, surnames, and geographic density. Two additional strategies of RDD were used to select respondents, the first from a set of telephone numbers generated to maximize the probability of Filipino Americans, and a second set of telephone numbers generated for the population in general. The general population RDD yielded a very small number of completed interviews relative to contacts made by interviewers (8 out of 1,028 attempts) primarily as a result of the low incidence of the Asian American population in the United States. The sampling design was stratified to collect a disproportionately high number of respondents from \"new immigrant destinations\" as defined by Audrey Singer of the Brookings Institution. In their raw format, 22 percent of the cases were selected from counties in new destinations while the remaining 78 percent were representative of the United States population. Cases were weighted to account for this stratified sampling design.
