Initial brain CT was performed within 12 hours from onset of SAH. Follow-up brain CT was performed within 24 hours from treatment of ruptured aneurysm. The primary outcome was neurological status upon six months later assessed with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS, 1 to 5). \r\nResults: Among 223 SAH patients, survival to discharge was identified in 202 (90.6%) patients. Of these survivors, 186 (83.4%) had good neurological outcomes (GOS of 3, 4 or 5). In this study, ONSDs in the poor neurological outcome group were significantly greater than those in the good neurological outcome group (all p < 0.01). Intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored in 21 (9.4%) patients at that time of follow-up CT scanning. There was a linear correlation between average of both ONSD and ICP in simple correlation analysis (r = 0.525, p = 0.036). In ROC curve analysis for prediction of poor neurological outcome, ONSDs had considerable predictive values (C-statistics: 0.735 to 0.812). In addition, the performance of a composite of Hunt and Hess grade and ONSD was more associated with poor neurological outcomes than the use of each marker alone.\r\nConclusions: The ONSDs measured on CT scanning may be beneficial for predicting neurological outcomes in SAH patients."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ryu, Jeong-Am"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-11-20"}]}},"files":[{"label":"ONSD SAH HDN-1.xlsx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":147303,"dataFile":{"id":3317107,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/DVJHBX/VQWQ1F","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DVJHBX/VQWQ1F","filename":"ONSD SAH HDN-1.xlsx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","filesize":137237,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1672ff84288-ca003cc2db08","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f4b692ed1b46c615036273b9be84c7f4","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f4b692ed1b46c615036273b9be84c7f4"}}}]}}}
