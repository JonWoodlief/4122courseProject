Political science has long valued the universality of these concepts and the powerful applications they allow for measuring and comparative purposes.  It was the chase after the elixir of a political science counterpart that led to this volume.  Despite its universal appeal, as a concept GDP remains limited in some ways. It does not include the non-monetized economy, the black market, the subsistence economy, or volunteer work, and it fails to address why the public sector is approximated by inputs not outputs. Yet, GDP remains the gold standard for cross national economic comparisons.  And GDP per c\napita is the measure of choice for assessing the average productivity of individuals across and within nations. Is there a GDP- like indicator that would allow scholars to compare governmental functions across time, space and across types of governments?  That was our challenge. Various attempts have been made to develop proxies for government performance but none of them have allowed scholars to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of governments, the performance of governments, vertically and horizontally--from the international to local levels.  In order to find our GDP-like political indicator, the various scholars contributing to this effort developed, tested and integrated three distinct measures of political performance. They are Extraction, Reach, and Allocation. Extraction approximates the ability of governments to appropriate portions of the national output to advance public goals. Reach gauges the capacity of governments to mobilize populations under their control. Allocation evaluates the share of public revenues provided to competing national priorities contrasted to the optimal allocation based on maximizing economic growth.    Each of these measures was tested empirically to determine if significant and substantive results followed from their application. These tests, as cataloged in this book, establish the universality of the political performance concept."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jacek Kugler and Ronald Tammen (eds.)
