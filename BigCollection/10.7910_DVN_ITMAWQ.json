intelligent, But the one most responsive to change.”\r\n- Charles Darwin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Libraries are considered as a place for storing and retrieving information from the available resources such as books, manuscripts, journals, and other sources of recorded information. The technological development is influencing to shift the libraries from traditional print resources to E-resources. Meanwhile the E- resources are not able to replace all the traditional print resources. The terms ‘Digital library’ and ‘Virtual library’ are used to refer the vast collection of information by which the people are able to access the information.\r\nThe traditional print format resources are dominated and used in all the libraries, before the development of information communication technology. But after the development of information communication technology, the electronic resources are also use in the libraries by its users with some of its specialised features. Same time the e-resources are not able to completely replace the traditional print resources. Because the print resources, provide some convenience to it’s users. So, the academic libraries should able to maintain and provide both print and e-resources effectively.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the academic libraries are concentrating on two important aspects for providing services to it’s users for creating the study environment. The two important aspects are 1) According to the curriculum programme the library provides resource and services to the users to create the best study environment.  2) According \r\nto the competence skill of the student and faculty the library provides resource and services to the users to create the best study environment.\r\n\r\nA resource is a source for supply of information. Typically resources are materials or other assets that are transformed to get benefit and in the process it may be consumed or made unavailable. Resource is a concept that has been common to all the areas, including life sciences, computer science, human resources, and other areas of human life day today activity.\r\n\r\nThe development of ICT provides an alternative or eliminates the traditional print resources in the libraries. In the present situation the print resources like books, periodicals and other resources are available in the E-resource formats. This E- resource format may provide the information to the user for twenty four hours a day.\r\n\r\nTechnology  is  redefining  the  very  notion  of  what constitutes a  book.  This evolution is accompanied by rigorous debate in the library and publishing worlds. For each expert who offers a vision of the e-book, living book, or networked book, another decries the reported death of the printed world.\r\n\r\n1. LIBRARY RESOURCES\r\n\r\nExhaustible items used for reference or lending such as books, periodicals, and microfilm that have a useful life greater than one year. Library resources are capitalized, depreciated and controlled by a recognized cataloging system1.\r\n1.1 DEFINITION\r\n\r\nAccording to Merriam Webster dictionary define the word resources as follows\r\n\r\na)  A source of supply or support : an available means —usually used in plural, b)  Something to which one has recourse in difficulty, \r\nc)  A possibility of,\r\n\r\nd)   Relief or recovery,\r\n\r\ne)  A means of spending one's leisure time,\r\n\r\nf)   An ability to meet and handle a situation2.\r\n\r\nThe term 'Resource' has a few different senses3:\r\n\r\n1.   A source of aid or support that may be drawn upon when needed;\r\n\r\n2.   The ability to deal with unusual problems resourcefully;\r\n\r\n3.   Available source of wealth; a new or reserve supply that can be drawn upon when needed.\r\nResources have three main characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Utility\r\n\r\n2. Limited availability,\r\n\r\n3. Potential for depletion or consumption.\r\n\r\nResources have been variously categorized as biotic versus a biotic, renewable versus non-renewable, and potential versus actual, along with more elaborate classifications. Similarly library resources give benefit by providing information to the users 4.\r\n2. HIGHER EDUCATION IN INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally academic libraries are considered as a heart of the institution. Academic libraries are situated within the academic institutions. It serves mainly for student’s research scholars, teaching and non teaching staff of the institutions. The resources of the academic library belong to the courses offer by the institutions. Generally all the academic libraries consist of text books, reference books, Journals, theses dissertations, project reports, maps, atlases, drawings, and magazines in both \r\nprint and electronic formats. Also, academic libraries are subscribing the on line journals, e books, on line databases for the benefit of students and scholars.\r\n\r\nThe  main  objective  of  the  academic  library  is  to  serve  the  academic community particularly their exams, preparation of seminar, conference, symposium, projects and research work. So, offering orientation programmes are essential to the users  and it will improve  the strength  of  the knowledge.  Academic  libraries  are directing the users for searching the information from print or e-resources.\r\n\r\nAcademic libraries provide the best information to it’s reader. University libraries are plays an important role for the academic community. It gives pleasure to the user and it also creates a learning environment in the university. Library is an important part of any academic institutions through the information distribution.\r\n\r\nThe important feature of academic library is based on some academic activities;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Academic library is a part and partial of the any educational system;\r\n\r\n\tAcademic  library  has  to  involve  the  academic  study  activities  such  as workshop and conference;\r\n\tThe  users  of  academic  library  are  students,  teachers,  researchers,  and administration staff.\r\n\tThe study programme of the institution depends on the academic library. To create the learning environment is depends on the use of library resources.\r\n\tNowadays the academic library environment is changed with the development of online and e-resources. The online resources are help to save the time of users and also to libraries. \r\nThe academic library environment gives quality and quantity of information to the  users  through  its  collection  and  that  is  identified  by  an  individual  learner according to his/her experience, competence and personal learning goals. The traditional and e-resources of the library's learning environment belongs to the information related to the users requirement; the ways information is being collected and distributed. Academic library resources are considered as a good measure of an institution's excellence and quality. The information resources and services available in the institutional information systems must be capable of supporting research activities among the students and faculty members.\r\n\r\nThe library as any organized collection of printed books and periodicals of any other graphic and audio visual materials and the services of the staff to provide the facilitate the such materials as are required to meet the information, research educational or recreational needs of its user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  TYPES OF INFORMARTION RESOURCES\r\n\r\nGenerally resources are classified into three types depends on the information available from the resource.1) Primary resources, 2) Secondary resources, and 3) Tertiary resources.\r\n\r\n3.1 PRIMARY SOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary sources are original materials. They are from the time period involved and have not been filtered through interpretation or evaluation. Primary sources are original materials on which other research is based. They are usually the first formal appearance of results in physical, print or electronic format. They present original \r\nthinking, report a discovery, or share new information. The definition of a primary source may vary depending upon the discipline or context.\r\n\r\nSome primary resources are given below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tArtifacts (e.g. coins, plant specimens, fossils, furniture, tools, clothing, all from the time under study);\r\n    Audio recordings (e.g. radio programs)\r\n\r\n    Diaries;\r\n\r\n    Internet communications on email, listservs;\r\n\r\n    Interviews (e.g., oral histories, telephone, e-mail);\r\n\r\n    Journal articles published in peer-reviewed publications;\r\n\r\n    Letters;\r\n\r\n    Newspaper articles written at the time;\r\n\r\n    Original Documents (i.e. birth certificate, will, marriage license, trial transcript);\r\n\r\n    Patents;\r\n\r\n    Photographs\r\n\r\n    Proceedings of Meetings, conferences and symposia;\r\n\r\n\tRecords  of  organizations,  government  agencies  (e.g.  annual  report,  treaty, constitution, government document);\r\n    Speeches;\r\n\r\n    Survey Research (e.g., market surveys, public opinion polls);\r\n\r\n    Video recordings (e.g. television programs);\r\n\r\n\tWorks  of  art,  architecture,  literature,  and  music  (e.g.,  paintings,  sculptures, musical scores, buildings, novels, poems).\r\n    Web site. \r\n3.2 SECONDARY SOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary sources are less easily defined than primary sources. Generally, they are accounts written after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. They are interpretations  and  evaluations  of  primary  sources.  Secondary  sources  are  not evidence, but rather commentary on and discussion of evidence. However, what some define as a secondary source, others define as a tertiary source. Context is everything. The definition of a secondary source may vary depending upon the discipline or context.\r\n\r\nSome Secondary resources are given below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bibliographies (also considered tertiary);\r\n\r\n    Biographical works;\r\n\r\n    Commentaries, criticisms;\r\n\r\n    Dictionaries, Encyclopedias (also considered tertiary);\r\n\r\n    Histories;\r\n\r\n    Journal articles (depending on the disciple can be primary);\r\n\r\n    Magazine and newspaper articles (this distinction varies by discipline);\r\n\r\n    Monographs, other than fiction and autobiography;\r\n\r\n    Textbooks (also considered tertiary);\r\n\r\n    Web site (also considered primary). \r\n3.3 TERTIARY SOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTertiary sources consist of information which is a distillation and collection of primary and secondary sources.\r\n\r\nSome Tertiary resources are given below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Almanacs;\r\n\r\n    Bibliographies (also considered secondary);\r\n\r\n    Chronologies;\r\n\r\n    Dictionaries and Encyclopedias (also considered secondary);\r\n\r\n    Directories;\r\n\r\n    Fact books;\r\n\r\n    Guidebooks;\r\n\r\n\tIndexes,  abstracts,  bibliographies  used  to  locate  primary  and  secondary sources;\r\n    Manuals;\r\n\r\n    Textbooks5 (also be secondary).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. CATEGORIES OF LIBRARY RESOURCES\r\n\r\nLibrary  resources  are  generally  categorized  in  to  two  types  based  on  its features and mode of usage.\r\nThey are\r\n\r\n1) Traditional resource\r\n\r\n2) Electronic resources \r\n4. 1 TRADITIONAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nGenerally resources are included a person, asset, material, or capital which is support to fulfill the task or any assignment.Similarly library resources consist of manpower of library and reading material like printed and electronic resources which are  meet  the  user’s  requirement.  But  the  manpower  of  library  is  only  providing service to the users. So, generally library resources are consider as the reading materials such as print and e resources.\r\nIn ancient period variety of materials are preserved in libraries and used as a library  reference.  Generally  the  word  “traditional”  denotes  that  trust  of  our  old customs or beliefs. Similarly, our ancestors are used as Birch Park, clay tablet, Codex, manuscript, ostracism, papyrus, scroll, vellum, wax tablet for made the library resources. After some technological development the paper was invented and it is used as a library resource. So, in our generation print resource are considered as traditional  library  resource.  But  more  technological  development  may  lead  the libraries to use e resources. So, library users are unable to avoiding both print and e resources in library.\r\n4.1.1 HISTORY OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY RESOURCES\r\n\r\nHistory of library resources includes the history of libraries. More than 6000 years back people were make records or written their ideas by pictorial scripts. They kept their records in bone, leather, clay, silk, paper, tapes and so on.\r\nThere are different types of resources used for written work and preserved in the libraries from ancient to present time. From time to time some technological improvements have been making changes in the library resources. At every stage these kinds of resources are preserved and maintained by the library-in-charges and served  to  library  users.  Now,  we  are  using  print  and  e  resources  based  on  our \r\nrequirement and availability. So we know what are the technological developments came across to reach this stage in library resources. Historical development of the library resources is just an evolution of library resources. History of library resources contains lot of the draw backs for collecting the information about resources. Some of the ancient library resources are given below;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.1.1 INSCRIBED IN CLAY: FROM 3100 BC\r\n\r\nThe clay was tablets were made 2000 years before the birth of Christ. The writing system was developed in Mesopotamia. During 3100 BC people were used clay for writing and reading6. The clay was available easily on those days.\r\nThere are two ingredients define the first script. Characters are formed from the\r\n\r\nwedge-shaped marks by which a corner of the reed is made while pressing into the damp clay - a style of writing known as cuneiform.\r\nClay tablets are kept in sunlight up to its dried and hardness. Because, the humidity may be affects the clay tablets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.1.2 THE EGYPTIAN PAPYRUS: 3000 BC\r\n\r\nDuring 3000 BC Egyptians were used as a writing material was called as papyrus. Papyrus was produced from an aquatic plant. It consists of smooth surface without roughness or any cracks.\r\nThe preparation of papyrus involves two processes. The processes begin with wetting and the second process is papyrus put in pressure. The green plant was cut and laid side by side to form a rectangle, and others are then laid across at right angles. After complete the cutting two layers are bonded with adhesives then it kept \r\nunder sunlight for the purpose of wetting. After wetting it gives pressure then up to twenty sheets are pasted together and it was called as papyrus scroll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.1.3 BAMBOO BOOKS: FROM 1500 BC\r\n\r\nDuring the 1500BC the writing material was used as bamboo in china. It is convenient for writing and preserving. The Chinese scripts at this early period were written in vertical columns, so a thin stripe of bamboo is convenient for a single column. To produce a lengthy document, threads are used for making continuity in the bamboo stripes.\r\nDuring the period of 5th  century the shang dynasty people were used wax,\r\n\r\nleaves, wood for purpose of writing and reading. During the 400BC the bamboo was used for made a book like reading material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.1.4 PALM LEAF MANUSCRIPTS\r\n\r\nThe manuscripts made out of dried palm leaves. They served as the paper of the ancient world in different parts of Asia as far back as the fifteenth century BCE and possibly much earlier7. South Asia and south East Asian people were used to record actual and mythical narratives.\r\nAt the beginning stage the communication was done orally, but after find the alphabets and its benefits were motivated the people eventually began to write it down in dried and smoke treated. After written completes, all document had only some limited time to be copied onto new sets of palm leave manuscripts. The reason for spreading Indian culture to South East Asian countries was the palm leaf manuscripts.\r\nDuring the early 19th century the invention of printing technology affects the manuscripts process like copying. \r\n4.1.1.5 PERGAMUM AND PARCHMENT\r\n\r\nIn turkey during 197 to 159 BC Pergamum was used as a reading and writing resource. This is best alternative for papyrus, but it was expensive. This is one type of leather. The Pergamum and parchment are using the period of 2nd BC.\r\nSince  about  2500  BC  the  leather  has  been  used  as  writing  and  reading\r\n\r\nresources, but only one side can be written on. If the ordinary leather was treated both sides it become smooth and able to write both sides.\r\nIt is not until much later, in the second century AD, that parchment becomes a serious rival to papyrus. But from the 4th until the 15th centuries it is the standard writing surface of medieval European scribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.1.6 BIRCH BARK DOCUMENT\r\n\r\nIn India during 4th century CE, the people were used this birch bark for wrote the Sanskrit text. In Russia early of 1400 CE the people were used this birch bark for written  purpose.  Birch  park  document  of  Gandhaharan Buddhist  texts  have  been found in jars. It expresses the culture of the people to the next generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn India for writing long scriptures and texts in Sanskrit and other scripts has been used the Birch park document of Himalayan Birch that was named as Betula utilis. Early Sanskrit writers such as kalidasa during the period of 4th century CE, Sushrutha during the period of 3rd century CE, and the period of 6th  century CE Varahamitra has been used bark document for their work. \r\n4.1.1.7 CODEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn latin the caudex means “trunk of a tree” or “block of wood”. It was a book format resource which was bound and used. The popularity of codex was associated Christianity. The Bible was written in codex document in early periods. The codex was considered as a familiar book form resources in the ancient world and also replaced  the  scrolls.  It  is  one  of  writing  resources  which  was  developed  by  the Romans.\r\n\r\nIt has been termed the most important advance in the history of the book prior to the invention of printing. The roman poet Martial during the period of the 1st- century AD, who was received appreciation for conveniently used. During the 6th century the codex had completely replaced the scrolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.1.8 OSTRACON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word ostrakon was derived from Greek, which means a shell pr shard. The plural form of ostracon is ostrca. Usually ostraca was produced from the broken earth ware vessels. It is a piece of pottery.\r\n\r\nThe scripts are like scratched-in words or other forms of writing which may give clues as to the time in use of ostraca. The ostraca was used as a voting ballot. The shard of pottery was used as a voting ballot in Athens. \r\n4.1.1.9 PARCHMENT & LEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of parchment and leather was based on the pergamena. The leather is supported to carry our ancient civilization into our next generation. In the quality aspect Pergamena was better than parchment and leather.\r\n\r\nIn Lerida of Spain during the period of 8000 BC the cave paintings of pergamena was rendered. During the period of 700 AD, the oldest existing version of the biblical Gospels, were written and illuminated on parchment. During the period of\r\n2600–2000  BC,  leather  scrolls  and  parchment  are  used  by  Ancient Egyptians  to record writings.\r\n\r\n4.1.1.10 WOOD PULP\r\n\r\nThe rags are one of the main ingredients for paper manufacturing process. The paper has white smooth and flexible pages, it provides convenient to its readers. During the period of 19th  century the demand of paper was increased. The main ingredients of paper rags also meet the requirement of paper production. So, paper manufacturers are try to alternate for rags that was esparto grass.\r\nPaper from wood pulp soon turns yellow and brittle. Many books of the late\r\n\r\n19th century are now in an unreadable condition, falling to bits, and books of our own time will follow even more rapidly down the same path. Electronic publishing has arrived none too soon8.\r\n4.1.1.11 PAPER\r\n\r\nPaper was invented during the period of AD 105 by the Chinese emperor Cai Lun. To make a sheet of paper these substances are repeatedly soaked, pounded, washed, boiled, strained and bleached. The mush is left to drain in a mesh frame and \r\nthen dried. The result is thinner and more flexible than papyrus or parchment, and much more adaptable to methods of large-scale production.\r\nPaper is the best resource for printing and maintaining in the form of books, periodicals in library. During the period of 800BC the paper preparation method is shifted to bhagdad, during 900 and it was moved to Egypt and Europe by 1400.In present situation papers are considered as a traditional resource because it is using in book form from the past several decades.\r\n4.1.2. EVALUATION OF TRADITIONAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThe evaluation of print resources is following some important aspects. There are\r\n  The publication of traditional print sources involves the some process that includes editing and article review. To maintain the standard and quality of print resources have required some processes i.e. verification of fact, reviews, and editorial work.\r\n  Print sources clearly stated that author’s details like his experience, working institution and interesting area, publication details and so on.\r\n\t\tAll the traditional print publications, clearly pointed out the sources to be consulted for complete the work.\r\n  While  bias  certainly  exists  in  traditional  publications,  printing  is  more expensive and difficult to accomplish. Most major publishers are out to make a profit and will either not cater to special interest groups or will clearly indicate when they are catering to special interest groups.\r\n  The Qualification of an author is necessary for accept by the publisher for the publication. \r\n  Publication information such as date of publication, publisher, author, and editor are always clearly listed in print publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.3.   FEATURES OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY\r\n\r\nAll traditional libraries have some features. There are\r\n\r\n  Generally libraries are the place to preserve and distribute the physical forms of resources, such as books and magazines, journals, periodicals.\r\n  To maintain these resources with cataloguing and classification.\r\n\r\n  Physical Searching method is using to retrieve the resources.\r\n\r\n  Information is stored in physical format. The users may be borrowed the resources and make use of it.\r\n  A   traditional   library   consist   details   of   available   stock   in   books   and subscription of periodicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.4.  ROUTINES  REQUIRED  FOR  MAINTAIN  PRINT  RESOURCES  IN LIBRARY\r\nThe  aim  and  objective  of  academic  library  is  to  serve  the  academic community. For providing best service is only based on the maintenance of resources. So there are some regular woks are necessary for maintain the traditional print library resources effectively. To maintain the traditional print resources is not easy task. That is purely based on the maintaining and updating of records.\r\n  Should be maintaining records for order and receiving of news paper and periodicals.  This  is  supporting  to  identify  the  not  supply  issues  from  the ordered periodicals. \r\n  For concern about the journals to maintain the back issues is essential. The back issues are using by researchers for their research.\r\n  Displaying of current issues of journals is important. This also creates the familiarity with the users about new journals.\r\n  Also display the new arrivals of books in library is important one. This also creates the familiarity with the users about the book and its subject.\r\n  Regular updating and shelving is required for book stock. This process may support\tto     identify     the     misplacing     of     Books.     According     to Dr S.R.Ranganathan misplacing of books is just equal to missing of books.\r\n  Should concentrate the updating of circulation register.\r\n\r\n  Should maintain a publisher’s catalogue for both books and periodicals. This is to find the future needs of library.\r\n  Maintain the records for ordering books and periodicals. It is helping to renew the periodicals and find the additional requirement.\r\n  Maintain the user statistics is essential for find the requirement of users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.5. ACCESSING METHOD OF PRINT RESOURCES:\r\n\r\nAccessing method of print resources is divided in to two types.\r\n\r\n1)  Open Access method: In this open access method the users are directly visited inside the library stock area or journal section or other sections and verify their requirement. If any resource is suitable for the users requirement the user can borrow that particular resource from library.\r\n2)  Closed Access method: In this closed access method users are required help or support from the library staff. The users are not permit inside the library. \r\nUsers are informing to library staff for their requirement and library staff may provide the resources to users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.6. ADVANTAGES OF TRADITIONAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThere is lot of advantages while using traditional library resources. Because it’s some features like the format, size, quality, easy to handling and etc.\r\n\t\tTraditional  print  resources  are  able  to  take  by  the  users  because  of  its portability. Compactness, light in weight and comfortable to read.\r\n       Traditional print resources are able to read. Even if computers are failure.\r\n\r\n\t\tUsers can turn the pages comfortably the traditional print resources. Because of the familiarity.\r\n  One of the traditional formats of print resources is very convenient for the users.\r\n\r\nBob Balay, in an article praising print reference sources that he facetiously titled “Notes  from  the  Jurassic,”  claimed  that,  with  print  reference  sources,  “you always know where you are and have a sense of the entirety of the source” 9.\r\n  Before publish all the print format resources are followed by processes like\r\n\r\nediting, and peer reviewing. The print resources are usually more authoritative than their E-resources. Healey points out that “the expense of publishing, combined with an extensive reviewing system and the relatively ‘fixed’ nature of printed materials, all help the librarians to find quality materials, and avoid shoddy, biased, or misleading works” 10\r\n  There is no need of any technology for read the print resources.\r\n\r\n  User can spend long time for using print resource. \r\n  A  traditional  format  of  print  resources  is  very  convenient  for  the  reading.\r\n\r\nTraditional format Printed resources are printed and bound in the different size for make use conveniently.\r\n  A traditional format of print resources is more portable, easier to read, and better to handle.\r\n  There is no specific places are required for store a printed format resources.\r\n\r\n  Printed  resources  are  more  environmental  than  e  resources.  The  printed resources are not creating any pollution in the environment.\r\n  Traditional Printed resources remain readable for many years.\r\n\r\n  The user can feel physically, cover, paper and binding from the original work while using the traditional Printed resources.\r\n  The user unable to use the print resources only the reason may be damaging.\r\n\r\nThe damage may happen after many decades of print.\r\n\r\n  Users can be able to buy used copies at significant discounts, as they can now easily do with printed resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1.7. DISADVANTAGES OF TRADITIONAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\n  The maximum number of printed reference books is available at high price.\r\n\r\nEven there are number of free search engines and search directories and web sites available online for user’s reference purpose.\r\n  Only one user can use a printed resource at one time. The user may lose the opportunity if the resources is misplaced or lost in library.\r\n  As  reporter  May  Wong  states,  “Once-a-year  updates  for  printed  editions means that “Some information can be stale even before the books get out of the box” 11. \r\n  If users want a traditional print resource he/she should visit the library during the working hours only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2. ELECTRONIC RESOURCES\r\n\r\nIn present situation the global communication and information transfer is easiest one. WWW and Internet are the most two important tool which is supporting for communication and Information transfer. The data are available in all the fields are huge amount for all users of internet.\r\nNow a days the information transfer is simple and which is possible by the rapid growth of information and communication technology. In that way the people can access information in the areas for their requirement. The Internet and www can be taken great place to supporting to the scholars in all the areas.\r\nE-resources  are  influencing  the  university  library  collection.  Because  the salient features of e resources such as multiple searching, providing global communications, cheapest access cost, storage and database maintenance etc. Sometimes the electronic form is the only alternative to print resource.\r\nElectronic resources are providing plenty of information to the present day Users. Electronic information resources can provide a lot of benefits than traditional print resources.\r\nFor the past few decades the growth of IT is enormous rate. This development may support to create document in electronic format and distribute via internet or intranet or other form of e resources like CD ROM and USB-drive and etc. So, the current  situation  of  libraries  is  also  changing  its  environment  to  e  resources  for provide information to its users. \r\n4.2.1. DEFINITION\r\n\r\nThere are some definitions are available in internet for E-Resources\r\n\r\nAccording to all words dictionary.com defines the term E-resource, “Information (usually a file) which can be stored in the form of Electrical Signals usually, but not necessarily, on a Computer”.\r\nAccording to Library Jargon of London south bank university describes the term E-resource, “A collection of on-line publications giving author, title, date, place of publication, publisher, details of edition, pagination, series and some idea of the contents. You will search this kind of database to find articles in journals. You can see a selection for your particular course on your subject portal”.\r\nAccording to glossary of British Library Development Studies define the term E-resource, “Resources which are available in electronic form, over the Internet, or on CD Rom”.\r\nAccording to glossary of library terms from Arts University College define the term e –resource, “The section of the Library’s web pages that provides access to our electronic resources, including databases, e-journals, e-books and e-newspapers”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.2 EVALUATING ELECRTRONIC RESOURCES\r\n\r\n4.2.2.1 PROCESS FOR PUBLICATION\r\n\r\nAll are able to publish their work through internet in the form of e-resource. The requirement of e publication is only a computer with internet connectivity. Some of the internet resources are not having editors or reviewers. But the online journals have editors and reviewers and so on. \r\n4.2.2.2 QUALITIES AND QUALIFICATION OF AUTHOR\r\n\r\nSome of the internet resources are unable to determine the Authorship and affiliations.  But  the  online  journals  and  e  books  are  having  the  authors  and affiliations.\r\n4.2.2.3 DETAILS OF REFERENCE SOURCES\r\n\r\nSome of the internet resources are not having exact information regarding the references used by the author.\r\n4.2.2.4 RELEVANCE\r\n\r\nThe online texts are not guiding the users properly. Sometimes unwanted items are downloading while searching the internet.\r\n4.2.2.5 AUTHOR DETAILS\r\n\r\nSome of the websites have explained its purpose and name of the author but not mention about the authors standard and qualities qualification.\r\n4.2.2.6 PUBLICATION INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThere is no assurance for availability of date of publication and how long the information is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.3 ELECTRONIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\nAn electronic library is allows users, to read or refer any published items from their residence or office or college via internet. Users are no need to visit the library directly for their reference.\r\n4.2.3.1 1DEFINITIONS: E-LIBRARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some definitions or explanations for e-library defined by some eminent personalities and publications of standard institutions for e-library. According to the features and functionality, the E-library defined as follows. \r\nA-Z of Library Jargon of oxford Brookes University define the term E-library as, “Section of the Library Web pages which provides access to databases, electronic journals, electronic books and electronic newspapers”.\r\n\r\nNational Diet library, Japan is defined the \"electronic library concept\" as \"a library which provides primary and secondary information electronically through communications networks and the basis for this purpose.\" Putting emphasis on the library as a mode of service, electronic library service, including in-library services, is broadly defined as \"service which enables library users to directly access electronic data via telecommunications networks.\"\r\n\r\nNow the academic libraries are shifting to the traditional print resources into e resource  and  maintain as  Institutional  repository.  Those resources are  theses  and dissertations and other innovative academic work done by faculty or students. The resources of institutional repository are distributing via internet or intranet to its user community. The benefits of e- library for the following:\r\n\r\nWhen using electronic information sources lot of benefits are obtain by the users that they are\r\n1) E-libraries are the best tool for providing online resources for research which will make easy to its users.\r\n2)  Retrospective search is easy and most convenient than print resource.\r\n\r\n3)  Literacy is increases when searching made by the educators.\r\n\r\n4)  Searching of index is also easy.\r\n\r\n5)  It supports for searching with the combination of keyword.\r\n\r\n6) While searching made by patrons for their project to retrieve a manageable amount of content, quickly and easily. \r\n7)  Provision for simultaneous access of multiple file.\r\n\r\n8)  E-libraries facilitate to its patrons for research solution.\r\n\r\n9)  Provision for printout and saved the down load items for future references.\r\n\r\n10) The distance learners are also searching their requirement from e library.\r\n\r\n11) E-Library provides the benefit to integrated search to dictionary, encyclopedia, almanacs, and etc through the reference desk.\r\n12) The simplest functionality like Point-and-click promotes the users interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.4    TYPES OF E-RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThe E resources are divided into two types depends on its features. They are\r\n\r\n1) Online e-resources, which may include the online resources, are providing information to its users via internet and www. Online resources are considered virtual one. Users are able to use the information in intangible manner. Some examples of on-line resources are given below\r\n-    E-journal (Full Text & Bibliographic Databases)\r\n\r\n-    E- books\r\n\r\n-    On-line Databases\r\n\r\n-    Web sites\r\n\r\n2)    Another type e resources may include the off line resources that are keep inside the library in the form of electronic materials. Users can be able to touch physically and use it. Some examples of resources are given below\r\n-    CD ROM\r\n\r\n-    Diskettes\r\n\r\n-    Other portable computer databases\r\n\r\nAbove mentioned e resources are explained in the following sections. \r\n4.2.5 E- JOURNALS\r\n\r\nAccording to wikipedia.org define the term E-Journals as, “(E-journal) Electronic journals, also known as e-journals, e-journals, and electronic serials, are scholarly journals or intellectual magazines that can be accessed via electronic transmission. In practice, this means that they are usually published on the Web”.\r\nAccording to glossary of African digital library define the term E-Journals, “An article or complete journal available fully electronically via a web-site on the Internet. It could be available free or as part of a paid for service. This trend is older and more established than the trend of providing e-book content via the Internet”.\r\nAccording to OCLC define the term E-Journals, “Journals, magazines, e-zines, webzines,   newsletters   and   types   of   serial   publications   that   are   available electronically”.\r\nAccording to glossary of Bolton define the term E-Journals, “Electronic versions of printed journals that can be viewed online via any PC connected to the Internet”.\r\nAccording to glossary of define the term E-Journals, “Online, full-text journals to which the library subscribes. They can be found by searching the Journal’s List, or by clicking on Find Journals, Magazines, Newspapers: at WPI (journal’s list) in the Quick Start area of the library home page”.\r\nLibraries are subscribing Electronic journals for users. E-journals consist of two important categories depends on what information it consists. This two categories consists some information which are very useful to users.\r\nThey are\r\n\r\n1) Full-text Journal Article: Full- text Journal articles are containing the relevant information such as citation, text, illustrations, diagrams and tables. \r\n2) Bibliographic Databases:  Bibliographic databases contain the information such as author’s name, journal title, publication date and page numbers. That is citation information of an article.\r\nTo better use of e-journal databases are need some proper organization and updating. The users are able to search only on title of the journal, unable to search the title or author of individual articles in print catalogue. But the e journal databases facilitate the user for searching the exact details like journal title, article title, author, abstract, year, etc. These are all the reason the electronic database is most convenient to its users and also support to the researchers for refer the current information as well as old information for their research. Generally, Libraries meet the problems like space for print journal, back issues, increasing price and damaging or missing issues and so on. These kinds of problems are avoiding in e-journals.\r\nComputer  with  internet  connectivity  is  enough  for  access  Electronic  journals. Simultaneously one or more than one user can access the e journals.\r\nSome publishers are providing the e journals with offer prices through the consortia. In India there are two major consortia which are run by AICTE and UGC respectively INDEST and INFLIBNET. These two consortia distribute the e-journals with offer price from leading e-journal publishers.\r\nE-journals are facilitating to maintain the back issues and provide the benefits to librarian and users.\r\n  It facilitate simultaneous access by more than one user\r\n\r\n  It facilitate remote access\r\n\r\n  Working in 365 Days per year\r\n\r\n  It facilitate different searching strategies\r\n\r\n  It facilitate additional links if required \r\n  It saves storage space\r\n\r\n  It facilitate multimedia information\r\n\r\nThe above merits of e-resources may lead to the libraries obtain licenses for receiving e journals from various publishers and deliver to its users. Otherwise subscribe through the vendor or through consortia for information delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.6 E- BOOK\r\n\r\nIn Indian universities, higher educational institutions like IIT, IIM and IIS are maintain the Library within the Campus for students, scholars and faculties. The recent information and communication technologies are directly influenced the print resources of library, also it converts into e resources like ejournals, e books and so on.\r\nWikipedia defined the e-book as, “An e-book (short for electronic book and also known as a digital book, ebook, and eBook) is “a portable electronic device used to download and read books or magazines that are in digital form.” Sometimes the equivalent of a conventional printed book, e-books can also be born digital”.\r\nAccording to Glossary of African digital library defined the term e-book, “(E- Books) A Book available fully electronically via a web-site on the Internet. E-Book readers have been developed for devices such as Palm Tops and PC's, including the notebook PC”.\r\nAccording to publishing glossary defined the term e-book, “This is a book in digital format that can be downloaded to your computer to be read or printed out, or to a portable eBook reader which you can carry around with you and read when convenient. eBooks come in different formats, depending on which device they will be read”. \r\nThe term e book describes by glossary of velocity micro, “E-books (aka eBooks, e-books, etc.) are type of electronic book that can be downloaded from a server in many different file formats: E-Pub, PDF, TXT, HTML just to name a few. They are meant to be read on the go and used as a lighter alternative to carrying actual books with you on travel, work, and leisure”.\r\nGenerally all the libraries are providing quality of information and services to the patrons for their utmost level of satisfaction. For achieve this target libraries collect preserve and disseminate the information resources such as print and non print materials.\r\nFew centuries back, the libraries kept resources in the form of print materials. But nowadays the requirement of information is high and systematically. This may influence the need, improvement and growth the of e books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.6.1 FEATURES OF E-BOOKS\r\n\r\nThere  are  some  valuable  feature  to  give  preference  for  e-books  such  as updated citation, references, connectivity to other sites, easiest searching, and so on. The features of e books are as follows\r\n      Able to circulate like printed books.\r\n\r\n      Provision for distance learning.\r\n\r\n      Able to transferred and carry easily.\r\n\r\n      Ability to change font size also motivates the users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.7    ON-LINE DATABASES\r\n\r\nOn-line Database is a collection of information categorized by specific fields.  Databases  are  usually  searchable  by  keywords  in  topics.  An  online- \r\ndatabase is an organized collection of information, of a particular subject or multi- disciplinary subject areas.\r\n  Wikipedia Define the term “An online database is a database accessible from a network, including from the Internet”.\r\n  Glossary of Tees University for library and information services define the term online database, “(Online Databases) An electronic collection of information, often containing journal articles, or references to journal articles, accessed via the Internet”.\r\n  UNM Glossary of Library, Computer, and Internet Terms define the word online database, “A computerized file, and within a Library setting it often contains periodical indexes”.\r\n  Glossary of South African medical research council defines the word online database “A collection of information arranged into individual records to be searched by computer, which is available through the Internet or an organization's Intranet”.\r\nThe   systematic   organisation   of   information   is   considered   as   database. Oganisation of database through internet or WWW is considered as online database. The online-database includes journal articles, newspaper articles, book reviews and conference proceedings, and bibliographical information etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.8 ADVANTAGES OF ELECTRONIC RESOURCES\r\n\r\nSpeed: As Lanier and Wilkins state, “providing access to information via the Internet is often quicker than using print sources”12. Librarians are not able to know all the subject areas. They are able to directing the users only up to their level of subject knowledge in traditional print resources. But in online resources they can get \r\nall the information whether they know or don’t know. Librarians just type the keywords in search box from the patron’s requirement and they receive the results within few seconds.\r\nEnhanced result: Online searches provide results which are better than the print resources. E-resources include audio and visual materials, color images, maps and  atlases,  drawings  and  other  enhancements  which  are  not  available  in  print sources.\r\nAccess information apart from library’s collection: The Internet resources are help to avoid carrying the print resources. Zumalt and Pasicznyuk claim13, for example, that “a library with a limited reference collection should consider funding Internet access to quickly buttress their ability to any field a wide range of questions. This  strategy  is  preferable  to  slowing  adding  print…  products  to  the  library collection”.\r\nMultiple accesses: More than one user can access the same resources at one time.\r\nCurrency: Internet has been providing the up-to-date information than print resources with cheap cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.9 DISADVANTAGES OF ELECTRONIC RESOURCES\r\n\r\nUnable to maintain standard: As Janes mentioned that, unlike in the world of printed material, “checks on style, grammar, authority, and quality have not been widely implemented in the networked world, In general it is caveat lector -- let the reader beware”14. \r\nUnable  to  search  older  information:  All  the  older  information  is  not available in online. Because the internet is the communication medium is developed recently. So, all the older information is unable to post online. Reporter Joel Achenbach points out, for example, that the majority of the Library of Congress’s 28 million books do not have the content available in online; he states that “a tremendous amount of human wisdom is invisible for the researchers who has just started using the Internet”.\r\nUnwanted   items   with   required   information:   while   searching   the information from online, the searcher may receive lot of unwanted items with relevant information. This may consume lot of time for find the relevant information. Morville points out, however, that “these relevance ranking algorithms are far from perfect”15; searchers may receive hints that are completely irrelevant to their search, or they may need to scroll through several pages of irrelevant material in order to find the web sites that deal with the topic of their search.\r\nUnstable  information:  All  the  internet  information  is  unable  to  give guarantee.  As Healey states, “A library may come to depend on access to a certain resource or database on the web, but will have no control over whether that item continues to be offered. As such, using the web as a resource can be a risky proposition”.\r\nHigh cost for online databases: There are lot of free online databases are available. But that is not enough for the researchers. So, they definitely subscribe some journals or databases for their research with high level of price.\r\nSearching techniques required for Users: Researchers usually require more instruction in order to use the online resources successfully. Kluegel states that the role of reference librarians now is “to serve as coach and tutor for the end-user \r\nconducting the search”. Reference librarians must therefore familiarize themselves with numerous online resources in order to teach patrons how to use the online resources effectively. Beyond just familiarity with the operation of a computer and with how to navigate the World Wide Web, use of online resources may pose specialized knowledge requirements, including:\r\n\tKnowledge  of  specific  search  commands.  Effective  online  searches  often require the searcher to be familiar with search commands that may be specific to the online source being searched. For example, Dialog, a fee-based online resource, has an extensive list of search commands that aren’t used by any other online resource.\r\n\tKnowledge  of  specific  search  syntax.  Online  searches  often  require  the searcher to know specific search syntax (e.g., use of Boolean terms such as “and” and “or” and “not”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  ELECTRONIC RESOURCES Vs TRADITIONAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nOne of the important criterions of any research is to evaluate information sources. In this aspect both print and e resources are made evaluation with the factors such as updating, references, citations, convenience of reading and etc. The most revolutions of information communication technology has forced to libraries for using e resources. There is lots of difference between print and traditional resources at the time of usage.\r\nSome sources such as journal or newspaper articles can be found in both print and digital format. However, much of what is found in the Internet does not have a print equivalent, and hence, has low or no quality standards for publication. \r\n5.1. USERS CONSIDERATION\r\n\r\nSo many considerable factors are available while using both Electronic and traditional resources. They are given below\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.1\r\n\r\n\r\nUSER CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nS.No\t\r\nElectronic Resources\t\r\nTraditional Resources\r\n\r\n1.\t\r\nNumber of search options are available\tDirect searching is not possible of all\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n2.\t\r\nOn line or virtual reference\tReference is possible only on shelf\r\nsearch\r\n\r\n3.\t\r\nAvailable in all 365 days per year.\tAvailable only at library opening\r\nhour.\r\n4.\tMulti user environment\tOnly one user access\r\n\r\n5.\tUser can access their requirement by\r\n\r\nanywhere else.\tUser access directly from library only.\r\n\r\n6.\tIndexing and abstracting service through\r\n\r\nDirect link with full text record\t\r\nNot linked full text.\r\n\r\n7.\tReproduction is printing method.

INDIAN SCENARIO FOR E-RESOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries function as an essential integral component in higher education system. Academic libraries in India are facing lot of problems due to static budget and exponential price hike of library collections.   The library environment is currently undergoing a rapid and dynamic revolution leading to new generation of libraries with the emphasis on e-resources.  A lot of efforts have been taken in the past few years to overcome this problem of financial crunch by resource sharing through consortia for university libraries.  UGC-INFONET and INDEST- AICTE consortium are the two major initiatives for university library users.  These revolutionary steps are providing scholarly resources including peer reviewed journals, databases, abstracts proceedings etc.  These efforts are boon to the university library users which will definitely boost the level of higher education in our country. \r\nLibrary Consortium is a group of two or more libraries which have agreed to co-operate with one another in order to fulfill certain similar needs, usually resource sharing.  It usually, refers to co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration between, and amongst the libraries for the purpose of sharing information.   Consortia are basically, evolving a form of cooperation among the libraries which come together to share  the  resources  electronically.    It  has  gained  momentum even  in  developing countries like India.\r\n\r\nSome of the successful library consortia setup so far in India is;\r\n\r\n\r\n1)        UGC-INFONET E-journal consortium.\r\n\r\n2)        Indian National Digital Library in Engineering, Sciences and Technology\r\n\r\n(INDEST) consortium.\r\n\r\n3)        Inter University Centers (IUC_DAEF Consortia)\r\n\r\n4)        Health Sciences Library and Information Network (HELINET)\r\n\r\n5)        Forum for Resource Sharing in Astronomy and Astrophysics (FORSA)\r\n\r\n6)        Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR e- journals consortium)\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the mentioned consortia, there have been efforts to setup similar kind of consortia by ICAT, ICMR, ICSSR and other government agencies to provide and access to e-resources.   Among the above all consortia, UGC- INFONET and INDEST- AICTE consortium are proving to be a boon for the academic users.  These two major initiatives have come to the rescue of academic libraries so that they can cater to the needs of academic depending upon them. These revolutionary steps are providing scholarly resources including peer reviewed journals, databases. Abstracts, proceedings etc. these efforts will boost the higher education system in India. \r\n7. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nNow days, the libraries and the internet provide both the scholars and the students easy and quick access to electronic information resources located all over the globe.   If the academic libraries wish to retain their pivotal role in their university setting they must gain knowledge of information seeking by their academic communities to provide quality services and access to relevant information, training and resources.   Developing modules of how students and academicians search for information is one of the ways to understand this.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this study is to analyze the dependency of library e- resource users, the perceived impact of the e-resources on the academic efficiency and problems faced by them while using the e – resources. The users are exposed to an array of e-resources through internet and other devices for research. They should be able to differentiate between useful and useless information and should be able to access the needed information effectively and efficiently.\r\n\r\nFor quite a long time librarians have been studying the needs of the users to improve  the  service  of  libraries  to  be  responsive  to  the  needs  of  their  users. Information seeking is a process of looking for, collection of documents / books / articles and identify those that deal with the subject of the user, the one searching for more information. There are systems designed to facilitate literature searching but the primary objective is the study of the users of libraries, the seekers of information and how they go about it, their behaviour while engaged in that search.   With the knowledge gained from the information seeking behaviour of any specific group of users, libraries with the aid of computers promote new modes of search with potential to enhance the process of search. \r\nThis modern information society, the user community has been demanding, pinpointed, exhaustive and expeditious information. To cater to the information needs of the library users libraries require accessibility to the variety of information sources, particularly the digital information in addition to the print documents. There is a need to study the usage of e-resources by the university students and the teaching faculties in various universities of Tamilnadu.\r\n\r\nThe present study is at the ‘micro level’ and the seekers of information are the graduates, post-graduate students, research scholars and teachers of the selected Tamilnadu Universities. They generally search for information/literature to follow up their classroom lectures, to prepare for discussions and seminars on specific issues and of course, to write up assignments and project reports.  They might also look for information in general and subjects of special interest to them. They might also be preparing for competitive examinations in search of a fruitful career.\r\n\r\n8. BRIEF RESUME OF THE SUCCEEDING CHAPTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first chapter deals with the Introduction of the study with elaborate description. The title of research work is well defined the library, library users and library resources are taken into study by categorizing traditional and e resources formats. The study is based on academic library of higher education including four selected universities of Tamil nadu.\r\n\r\nThe seconded chapter ‘review of literature’ deals with the previous study which is related to this research .More than ninety references were taken for the research.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter ‘methodology’ deals with Objectives, Hypothesis, Method used for the study ,Scope, Limitations, Population for the study, Sample for the study, \r\nTools used ,Description of the tool, Statistical techniques used are included in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapter deals with the analysis and interpretation and gives the detail analysis of the data collected and applying the statistical analysis made.\r\n\r\nThe fifth chapter deals with the findings of this analysis, further suggestions and conclusion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPERENCE\r\n\r\n1)  www.ofm.wa.gov/policy/glossary.asp\r\n\r\n2)  www.Ehow.com\r\n\r\n3)  wikipaedia on answers .com\r\n\r\n4)  http://www.investerwords.com/4217/resource.html#xzz261g51feh\r\n\r\n5)  www.educationonline.com\r\n\r\n6) http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa92#ixzz02Ufi z5no\r\n7)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palam_laef_manuscript#cite_note-8\r\n\r\n8)  www.wikianswers.com\r\n\r\n\r\n9)  Balay, Bob. “Notes from the Jurassic.” Against the Grain 9 (1997): 24-26\r\n\r\n10) Healey, Paul D. “Untangling the Web: The World Wide Web as a Reference Tool.” RQ\r\n\r\n34 (1995): 441-444\r\n\r\n11) Wong May. “Encyclopedias: On the Way Out; Already Like Artifacts of a Vanished\r\n\r\nAge.” News and Observer [Raleigh] 10 Mar. 2004.\r\n\r\n12) Lanier, Don, and Walter Wilkins. “Ready Reference Via the Internet.” RQ 33 (1994):\r\n\r\n359-367.\r\n\r\n13) Zumalt, Joseph R., and Robert W.

According to Bruce, “The review forms an important chapter in a thesis where its purpose is to provide the background to and justification for the research undertaken.”1      The review of literature is a critical look at the existing research that has relevance and significance to the work that is being carried out. A literature review is an account of what has been published on a topic by accredited scholars and researchers.  It also allows a researcher to refine the research question based on the experiences of others.  This chapter presents a review of related literature on the topic taken up for investigation.\r\nThe reviews provided in this chapter are drawn from previous studies at the international, national and regional levels, reported by scholars on public library, its use, users and their perceptions and satisfaction regarding library collection, staff and services including the internet provision. The reviews comprise of Indian and foreign studies on the topic of present investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 REVIEW OF GENERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nGabriel Aine Obinyan(2011)2, carried out a study entitled “Use of Information Resources in Four Branches of a State Public Library in Nigeria”. A survey study was carried out on the use of information resources and services in community public libraries in Nigeria with particular reference to Edo State. The study revealed that the majority of users were students and youths whose information needs were basically for examination and for personal enlightenment. \r\nThe available resources in the libraries were found to be inadequate and in most cases, inappropriate. This situation was credited to poor funding of the libraries as well as to lack of local content in the collection of the public libraries. It was also revealed that the libraries lacked Internet facilities. In terms of service delivery, the libraries also lacked the capability and competence to provide translation services to the non-literate group of the communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModepalli Doraswamy (2010) 3carried out a study “Information Use Patterns of Post-Graduate Students: A Case Study of P. B. Siddhartha College of Arts and Sciences, India”. This study investigates information use patterns of post- graduate students at Siddhartha College of Arts and Sciences, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India. It focuses on the kinds of academic information needed by post- graduate students, such as what information resources they need, their methods for locating information, and their level of satisfaction of the library collection, services, and facilities. A descriptive survey method was used, and the data was gathered   via   a   questionnaire   completed   by   140   post-graduate   students.\r\nRespondents were also asked for their opinions and suggestions during the data collection process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaria Anna Jankowska and James W. Marcum (2010) 4, “Sustainability Challenge for Academic Libraries: Planning for the Future”. There is growing concern that a variety of factors threaten the sustainability of academic libraries: developing and preserving print and digital collections, supplying and supporting rapidly changing technological and networking infrastructure, providing free services, maintaining growing costs of library buildings, and lowering libraries’ \r\necological footprint. This paper discusses the multidimensional issues of sustainability in academic libraries and identifies needs for designing an integrated framework for sustainable strategies in academic libraries. Additionally, the paper presents a synthesis of existing  literature on the increasingly popular topic of “green libraries” and prepares a background toward developing a framework for sustainable strategies in academic libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKatherine Tyler, (2011), 5  focused specifically academic institutions serving virtual patrons must remain focused on meeting the needs of those library users by continually examining their preferences, their searching behavior, and the information they seek. The purpose of this research was to determine if virtual patrons  are  satisfied  with  the  resources  and  services  being  provided  by  a university’s online library. Following a web-based survey, demographic characteristics of students were analyzed to determine if any influenced students’ satisfaction. Using analysis of variance, correlation, and descriptive statistics, several demographic factors were found to influence student satisfaction with the\r\nlibrary’s online resources: age, gender, achieved educational level, student status, and computer experience. One factor, computer experience, was found to influence student satisfaction with the library’s online services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDehua  Hu(2012) 6,  carried  out  the  academic  libraries  became  acutely aware that the expansion of research activity had resulted in an increase in the numbers of journals, and in the numbers of articles published. These changes were followed by increased journal subscription prices, and the combination of these three  factors  caused  the  “serials  crisis”  The  China  Academic  Library  and \r\nInformation System (CALIS) proposed five criteria for evaluation of sustainable development of digital resources which included both OA resources and general online resources such as subscription E-journals. These proposed five criteria were,\r\n1.The proportion of digital resources in the library resources, 2.The proportion of digital resources to be permanently available in the library resources, 3.The cost of long-term preservation  of  digital  resources,  4.  Fair  usage  of  digital  resources,\r\n5. The archiving methods of digital resources. These technical standards guide the construction of academic library digital resources, and ensure the sustainable development of digital library collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJie  Sun(2012) 7,  study  that  the  digital  libraries  promise  new  societal benefits, especially for e-learning in digital or mobile times, starting with the elimination of the time and space constraints of traditional bricks-and-mortar libraries. The library and information professionals are required to acquire such knowledge and skills as the library is one of the highly IT influenced service profession.  This  paper  gives  an  overview  of  current  trends  in  digital  library research consists of digital library characteristic, advantage, disadvantages and function. This paper also highlights on the impact of information technology on the traditional library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevendra Kumar and Rajkumar Singh (2009)8 a study entitled “Information resources and services of national science library India, New Delhi: A user study” The study examines the use of services by the users of National Science Library (NSL), New Delhi, India. A well structured questionnaire was used to identify the impressions of NSL users towards the various aspects. 120 \r\nquestionnaires were distributed among the NSL users and 108 filed were received back. The questionnaires were checked and 108 (90%) questionnaires were found fit for analysis and out of which 12(10%) were considered unusable. The present study demonstrates and elaborates a various aspects of NSL collections uses within the available resources, frequency and purposes of visit, user satisfaction within NSL services and information about documents. Further attempt has also been made to highlights the findings of the study and a few suggestions have been given based on the analysis of data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSyamalamba  Rani  (2009)9   carried  out  a  study  entitled  “Library  Use Pattern of Undergraduate Students in Minority Degree Colleges in Andhra Pradesh”. Library is considered an integral component of any efficient education system. It plays an important role in the improvement of the organisation. This study, which was conducted in minority aided degree colleges, reveals the nature and the extent of use of college libraries in Andhra Pradesh. It evaluates in detail the type of material, sources and the services used by the students. It also assesses the extent of student’s satisfaction regarding collection, timings and library staff cooperation in finding the information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAkobundu Dike Ugah and Umudike (2008) 10 entitled, “Availability and Accessibility of Information Sources and the Use of Library Services at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture”.Using the case study method, the author investigated the availability and accessibility of information sources and the use of library services in the university library, Michael University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria. The population was made up of 1,000 registered \r\nlibrary users, with a random sample of 200. A response rate of 168 was recorded. The study revealed that information sources in the library are not readily available nor easily accessible and concludes that the independent variables of availability and accessibility have influence on, and a significant relationship with, the use of library services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunil Tyagi(2011) 11  The study examine how scientists of Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Laboratory (HPL) use electronic information resources, whether print or electronic are read more, whether there is a pattern among types of users. The problem has been studied based on the information available in the open literature and a survey conducted. The methodology for the proposed study is “Survey Method” with the help of structured questionnaire. The result showed a growing interest in usage of electronic information resources among the Scientists of HPL. All the respondents belonging to the laboratory used EIS to consult drug indexes and compendia, to consult monographs, to consult drugs related online\r\ndatabases,  to  consult  drugs  related  e-journals,  to  consult  drug  promotional literature and to consult standards. All the respondents stated that to a very high extent EIS has become a substitute for printed materials. These findings have implications for collection development, promotion of library resources, and end- user training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWaldman (2007) 12 carried out a study entitled “Users' information behaviour - a gender perspective”. The paper is based on the study of library users in Slovakia as part of a larger research project on the use of information.  A large- scale questionnaire survey was conducted in 2002 in sixteen academic and research \r\nlibraries with 793 subjects, especially students and educators.The data were analysed with the use of statistical package SPSS. Gender differences are analysed with regard to ways of information seeking, use of electronic resources and publishing. Results indicate that men prefer individual information seeking and women apply collaborative information use. By sorting user types it was found out that women tended to manifest a pragmatic way of information use (the S type). Men confirmed analytic information processing (the A type). Women declared less experience in the use of electronic resources and publishing. Differences in orientation, collaboration and feelings have been noted. Gender as a variable can be  productive  for  better  understanding  of  cognitive  and  social  background  of human information processing. Findings can inform design of services and systems and information literacy policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuresh  Chand(2011)13   The  purpose  of  education  is  well-rounded development. Students need a combination of arts, computer science, science, and humanities or literature courses to achieve this kind of development. A well-equipped and well-managed library is the foundation of modern educational structure. It is said that education without library services is like a body without soul, a vehicle without an engine, and building with bricks but no cement. The library is the chief instrument for accumulating and using our intellectual heritage. Formal education can be conducted effectively and efficiently only with well-equipped libraries. Academic libraries are the nerve centers of their institutions, and must support teaching, research, and other academic programmes. University library is a way of making educational and research data and information available to faculty, researchers, students, and others at the institutions and worldwide. \r\nSingh,  K.  P.Satija,  M.  P.  (2007)  14    carried  out  a  study  entitled “Information seeking behaviour of agricultural scientists with particular reference to their information seeking strategies”. The paper is an outcome of the research study conducted by the authors on information seeking behaviour of agricultural scientists working in the ICAR institutions of Delhi and Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. Data has been collected through the structured questionnaire and analyzed with the help of latest version of MS-Excel for appropriate statistical procedures for the description (i.e., frequencies, percentage, means, and standard deviations, etc). Study discusses the findings of various strategies and procedures\r\nadopted by the agriculture scientists in meeting their information requirements. The agriculture scientists were asked to ranks the information sources in on the basis  of  I,  II,  and  III  in  the  order  of  priority.  The  survey  result  shows  that agriculture scientists have expressed great dependence in meeting their information requirements on their institutional library/information centre. The Library/Information Centre is the most preferred source (72.05%) of the respondents for all categories of agriculture scientists. On the other hand for accessing   information,   agriculture   scientists   highly   depend   on   the   library collection, followed by the personal collection, collection of their supervisor and of their colleagues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMahajan and Preeti (2005)15 carried out a study entitled “Academic Libraries in India: a Present-Day Scenario”.Education aims to impart knowledge and makes good citizens. Libraries are the repositories of knowledge and form an integral part of education. Libraries have a long history, starting with the chained and closed-access libraries of earlier times to the present-day hybrid, digital, and \r\nvirtual libraries that use the latest technology for provision of information through various services. Accordingly, librarians have also changed from storekeepers who were concerned with protection of books against theft, mutilation, and pilferage, to that of information officers, navigators, and cybrarians who find themselves in the vast ocean of reading material and are busy in satisfying their clients who want anytime and anywhere information. With the advent of computers, the nature of libraries  has  changed  dramatically.  Computers  are  being  used  in  libraries  to process, store, retrieve and disseminate information. As a result, the traditional concept of library is being redefined from a place to access books to one which houses the most advanced media including CD-ROM, Internet, and remote access to a wide range of resources. Libraries have now  metamorphosed into digital institutions. Gone are the days when a library was judged by its quantitative resources. Today, libraries are surrounded by networked data that is connected to vast ocean of Internet-based services. Moreover, electronic resources relevant to the professions are developing at an unprecedented pace. Academic libraries are considered to be the nerve centers of academic institutions, and must support teaching, research, and other academic programmes. The situation in academic libraries of India is the same as that of academic libraries the world over; however, Indian  libraries  must  provide  maximum  information  with  limited  resources.

According to a \r\n1983 Time magazine article, which named the personal computer the “Man of the Year” for 1982, most Americans at that time were receptive to the proliferation of the personal computer and optimistic about its impact on their lives; nearly 80% of Americans polled indicated that they expected home computers to become as common place in homes as television sets or dishwashers, 68% said that they thought that the computer would improve the quality of their children’s education, and 67% reported a belief that computers would ultimately raise production and,\r\ntherefore, standards of living 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American public in the 1980s was enraptured with the idea that the personal computer could be used to improve their daily lives, the possibility of using computers to conduct research was far from the minds of most librarians. As Simmons-Welburn put it, “In 1980, computers were not yet a part of the chest of tools that every reference librarian carries” Zumalt and Pasicznyuk note that the Internet wasn’t mentioned in any type of library professional, research, or trade journal until Perry, Blumenthal,and Hinden’s “The ARPANET and the DARPA\r\nInternet”17appeared in Library Hi Tech in 1988.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCynthia(2004) 18, exploratory study reports the results of 20 in-person interviews conducted with professional reference librarians at public libraries in the Triangle area of North Carolina regarding the librarians’ opinions about the impact that online reference sources have had on the collection and use of print reference sources at their libraries. Study results indicate that most librarians are comfortable with using both print and online reference sources to answer patrons’ reference questions but that they have found that certain types of questions lend themselves more  readily  to  being  answered  either  by  print  or  by  online  reference  sources. \r\nLibrarians stated that a patron’s preferences often dictate whether they will use a print or an online source to answer the patron’s reference question. Additionally, many librarians reported that several reference sources formerly held in print format have been augmented or replaced by online reference sources. In fact, it was not until the\r\n1990s  that  it  began  to  seem  more  possible  that  computers  could  be  used  for research purposes. Although the Internet took shape in the 1960s, it wasn’t until\r\n1989 that the World Wide Web was developed in order to provide a graphical interface to the Internet. During the 1990s, as large numbers of web sites, search engines, and search directories were developed and refined, researchers began to recognize the value of using computers for conducting research.\r\nOther librarians also noted the potential for computers to change the way in which reference transactions were handled. For example, in a 1992 article, Jerry D. Campbell, the University Librarian at Duke University, stated, “We should set ourselves the goal of answering no less than 75 percent of the questions that currently  come  to  our  reference  desks  using  computers  and,  yes,  without\r\nhuman intervention” 19.\r\n\r\nBut not all librarians were immediately convinced of the value of the Internet for conducting reference transactions. Olson’s 1992 survey of 130 university  reference  librarians,  for  example,  revealed  that  23%  said  that  the Internet had no value at all in helping them complete their daily reference tasks, while another 61% said that the Internet was only of moderate value in aiding them with their daily reference duties. Similarly, Schilling and Wessel 20  found that of the 103 reference department heads whom they surveyed, only 35% of respondents considered the World Wide Web to be “very,” “somewhat,” or “slightly” useful in their jobs. \r\nOther librarians conceded that the Internet might be useful in helping some librarians perform certain daily tasks, but they claimed that the Internet did not lend itself to certain types of interactions. Lanier and Wilkins, 21  for example, wrote in 1994, “Ready reference is one area in which Internet access may seem to offer only minimal benefit. The experienced reference librarian knows traditional ready reference information sources well. What could be easier than consulting the appropriate print source to deliver a quick bit of information?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 REVIEW OF ELECTRONICS RESOURCES\r\n\r\nAhmed  Elhafiz  Ibrahim  (2004) 22   his  study  entitled  “Use  and  User Perception  of  Electronic  Resources  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  University” proved that the use by faculty members in the UAEU of e-resources was not at the anticipated level that would effectively enhance the learning and research process as stated in the mission statement of the Libraries’ Deanship. Significant low usage was reported for e-books, bibliographic databases and e-journals. These attitudes might be a result of a lack of awareness about the e-resources provided by the library or due to ineffective channels of communication in campus as reported in earlier  research.  Some  respondents  have  missing  values  in  the  question  about\r\nfrequency of use of e-resources; this might be explained as lack of awareness of the participants about the resources provided by the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJambhekar,N.D  (2011) 23   analyses  his  study  entitled  “The  traditional Library system and the framework to convert it into Digital Library: A case Study” Today,  the  rate  of  peoples  to  read  books  is  tremendously  increased  due  to awareness of education everywhere. The college’s efficiency is depends on their \r\nability to manage information effectively, whether for educational, research, business and governmental purposes. Each time, we must rely on paper based library. To concern with the demand and availability of books in the paper oriented libraries, it is not possible to available the copies of books, journals to all students, lecturers, researchers at a time depending on their changing requirements. This is not affordable to any paper oriented library to keep all books with complete needed copies. To solve these problems, the Digital Libraries must be implemented across colleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSathe,Nila A(2002),24  During the month-long study, patrons completed sixty-nine surveys of electronic and ninety surveys of print journal use. Results analysis  indicated  that  fellows,  students,  and  residents  preferred  electronic journals,  and  faculty  preferred  print  journals.  Patrons  used  print  journals  for reading articles and scanning contents; they employed electronic journals for printing  articles  and  checking  references.  Users  considered  electronic  journals easier to access and search than print journals; however, they reported that print journals had higher quality text and figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIshwara Bhat M (2009)25, there is a large quantity of subscribed e- resources in our libraries and they contain quality information, though expensive. In  spite  of  advantages  in  terms  of  access  and  search  capabilities,  they  are underused. Systematic plan has to be in place for their promotion of use. While a good ICT infrastructure is a prerequisite, it alone will not do. Proactive strategies are required and these need to be adopted imaginatively. Access to e-resources need to be made easier for both on campus and off campus users. As a priority, \r\nactive users need to be identified and they need to be converted to heavy users of resources. Secondly, non users be converted to active users Various methods have to be tried in order to grab the attention of the users towards the e-resources. User training  will  increase  the  confidence  level  of the  users. Traditional awareness methods include: Personal visits, user training, brochures, posters and displays. Newer technologies from the Web 2.0 such as RSS alert service, Blogs, Wikis and Face book make the interaction with the library not only interesting but also add more value. Finally, the effectiveness of various promotional strategies needs to be measured by monitoring the usage and user feedback.\r\n\r\nKannappanavar(2010) 26, Since India is a land of farmers, socioeconomic development depends on the education of farmers and their information level. They need information to become enlightened and rational and to make quick and correct decisions to improve rural life. The nature of information services provided by the agricultural university libraries vary from one to another, owing to the range of interest of the user community. With the emergence of the computer and revolutionary changes in communication technology, it has become possible for a agricultural   university   libraries   to   provide   a   variety   of   technology   based information services to users with a wide range of interests. The libraries under study are in the initial stage of development. Modern technologies in the libraries are now being used to satisfy the information need of users. The people working in these libraries need training and exposure to new technologies. There is a need to develop the culture of interlibrary loan services and electronic transmission of documents. Databases of theses, journal articles and library catalogues must be made available to users. \r\nBashorun (2011)27,  this study for the user perception of the electronic resources by the academic staff of the University of Ilorin. The sample consists of\r\n250 academic staff selected from eight (8) out of the twelve (12) faculties that made up of the university. Data were collected through an electronic resources user perceptional survey (ERUPS). Responses were received from 225 (90%) academic staff of the eight faculties. Analysis revealed frequency of use of electronic resources was low. Reasons alluded to were lack of time because of the time required to focus on teaching; lack of awareness to electronic resources provided by the library; power outage, ineffective communication channels, slow network and inadequate searching skills. The study recommended adequate Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) training for all categories of academic staff and provision of adequate power supply.\r\n\r\nMara Rojeski (2011)28, Libraries have grappled with how to integrate ebooks into our collections since they came onto the market. ebooks offer some tempting  advantages,  such  as:  saving  physical  space  in  the  library,  increasing access to those off campus, and potentially allowing multiple users simultaneous use of one item. Recent books like No Shelf Required offer some guidance for libraries grappling with questions that ebooks bring up. Smaller academic libraries face  unique  challenges  when  evaluating  how best to  use  ebooks to  serve  our patrons. Given their smaller budgets, they often still engage in title-by-title books selection. Many larger institutions engage in standing orders for print acquisitions or purchases of large packages of ebooks. As financial constraints grow even tighter, we all want to make sure that we get the most use out of the materials we \r\nacquire. This involves detailed study of our users’ interaction with library materials and creative thinking on the part of librarians.\r\n\r\nSingh Gurdev(2010)29, This paper describes the use of electronic resources by the students and teachers of various college libraries of Delhi. The survey was particularly conducted to know the use of e-resources and awareness of electronic resources in various college libraries of Delhi. The analysis of the data collected covers various types of e-resources, purpose of use of e-resources, problems faced by the users in using the e-resources, satisfaction level of users and finally it highlights the suggestions made by the users for further improvement of use of e-\r\nresources in various college libraries of Delhi. This study has also shown the preferences and importance given to e-resources by the students and teachers of various college libraries of Delhi.\r\n\r\nSaikia Mukesh(2011)30,  This  article  discusses  a  survey  conducted  by author to learn perceptions of teachers and research scholars of Tezpur University towards electronic journals. The survey determined the views and feeling of teachers and research scholars on electronic journals. The survey distinguished between user's format preferences for those journals that are most important to their teaching and research. This study is conducted to learn users perception of online jour-nals and determine a policy for subscription of journals to meet the needs of teachers and research scholars of the university.\r\n\r\nHadagali Gururaj(2011)31, Examines the use of electronic resources by faculty members and research scholars of universities of Karnataka State, India, in order to determine the level of use and different purposes of using electronic resources,   and   its   impact   on   the   academic   community.   A   total   of   604 \r\nquestionnaires were distributed and 479 (79.63%) completed questionnaires were retuned; Survey responses were coded and input into Excel for analysis. Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was also used for construct frequency tables, and calculates Mean, Standard Deviation and Co-efficient of Variation. The study emphasizes different aspects such as, the future of the library and information services in academic libraries depends upon major factors, like, availability of adequate manpower, which provision for continuous updating of IT skills and and allocation of adequate recurring grants to procure, update and maintain IT infrastructure and electronic resources.\r\nThanuskodi, S. (2011)32 carried out a study entitled “Usage of Electronic Resources at Dr T.P.M. Library, Madurai Kamaraj University: A Case Study” Information technology (IT) has thrown a new challenge to the libraries. The technology has shown a great impact on the services of the libraries. Libraries use IT for better services and satisfying diverse user needs. Libraries have transformed into  digital  and  virtual  libraries  where  books,  journals,  and  magazines  have changed into e-books, e-journals, and e-zines. This has increased the global dissemination of information. Electronic resources (e-resources) are easily accessible in the remote areas. The e-resources solve storage problems and control the flood of information. Print sources are being digitised. There is a great need to study the use of e-resources and investigate the factors that are a hindrance to their use. The present study is an attempt to examine the usage of electronic resources at Dr  T.P.M.  Library,  Madurai  Kamaraj  University.  Study  revealed  that  M.Phil\r\n\r\nstudent’s respondents took the first position in their overall methods of searching e-resources, postgraduate student respondents the second position, PhD Scholar respondents the last position. The study confirmed that respondents were aware of \r\nthe e-resources and various types of e-resources, e-database, and e-journals. The study recommended the improvement in the access facilities with high internet speed and subscription to more e-resources at Dr T.P.M. Library, Madurai Kamaraj University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nK. R. Mulla, M. Chandrashekara (2006)33 carried out a study entitled “E- Resources  and  Services  in  Engineering  College  Libraries  –  A  Case  Study”. Libraries have witnessed a great metamorphosis in recent years both in their collection development and in their service structure. Over the last several years, a significant transformation has been noticed in collection development policies and practices. Print medium is increasingly giving way to the electronic form of materials. This study examines libraries by region within the State of Karnataka, India.  It examines the level of effort taken by the engineering college libraries in Karnataka to build electronic resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Chetan Sharma (2009)34 carried out a study entitled “Use and Impact of E-Resources at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (India): A Case Study”. Today availability of e-resources in a university library is very common. But their proper and maximum use is a matter for discussion. The present paper examines the existence of various e-resource databases in Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University Library. The study also highlights the preferences and importance of online resources among the teachers and research scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdeyinka Tella (2007)35  carried out a study entitled “Self-Efficacy and\r\n\r\nUse of Electronic Information as Predictors of Academic Performance”.Students’ \r\nability to find and retrieve information effectively is a transferable skill useful for their future life as well as enabling the positive and successful use of the electronic resources while at school. It is a known fact in this digital era that any student at the higher level who intends to better achieve and go further in academics should have the ability to explore the digital environment. Students are increasingly expected to use electronic information resources while at the university. Research was undertaken to determine the level of influence of self-efficacy and the use of electronic information resources on students’ academic performance. This study examined self-efficacy and the use of electronic information as predictors of academic performance. Its participants were comprised of 700 students (undergraduate and postgraduate) randomly drawn from seven departments in the faculty  of  education,  University  of  Ibadan,  Nigeria.  Data  on  the  study  was collected through the Morgan-Jinks (1999) academic self-efficacy scale and the use of the electronic information scale (UEIS) with r = 0.75.  Three research questions were raised to guide the study.  The results indicate that self-efficacy and the use of electronic information jointly predict and contribute to academic performance; that respondents with high self-efficacy make better use of electronic information and have better academic performance; that a correlation exists among self-efficacy, use of electronic information and academic performance; and that the use of electronic information influenced respondents' performance in General Education subjects more than other subjects. Finally, the results reveal that the Internet is the electronic information source student’s access for information most often. Implications of these results and recommendations are discussed.\r\n\r\nMicaela Waldman (2003)36 carried out a study entitled “freshmen’s use of library electronic resources and self-efficacy”. To encourage students' use of the \r\nlibrary, and in particular of its electronic resources, we need to understand what factors encourage students to seek out information in the library setting. Research has shown that self-efficacy influences academic achievement. This paper looks at the role self-efficacy plays in their search for information and use of the library's electronic resources, by surveying a class of freshmen at Baruch College. Their library and computer use were analyzed and correlated with their self-efficacy scores. Through statistical analysis, we found that use of the library correlated to the students' use of the library's electronic resources. We also found out that students who express an interest in learning about the library's electronic resources will be more likely to have higher self-efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXuemei Ge R (2010)37 carried out a study entitled “Information-Seeking Behavior in the Digital Age: A Multidisciplinary Study of Academic researchers”. This article focuses on how electronic information resources influence the information-seeking process in the social sciences and humanities. It examines the information-seeking behavior of scholars in these fields, and extends the David Ellis model of information-seeking behavior for social scientists, which includes six characteristics: starting, chaining, browsing, differentiating, monitoring, and extracting. The study was conducted at Tennessee State University (TSU). Thirty active social sciences and humanities faculty, as well as doctoral students, were\r\ninterviewed about their use of electronic information resources for research purposes, their perception of electronic and print materials, their opinions concerning the Ellis model, and ways the model might apply to them. Based on the interview results, the researcher provides suggestions on how current information services  and  products  can  be  improved  to  better  serve  social  sciences  and \r\nhumanities researchers. The author makes recommendations for improving library services  and  technologies  to  better  meet  the  needs  of  social  sciences  and humanities scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSandra.J. (2000)38 carried out a study entitled “When Questions Are Answers:  Using  a  Survey  to  Achieve  Faculty  Awareness  of  the  Library’s Electronic Resources”. The Utah State University (USU) Libraries spend approximately  11  percent  of  their  materials  budget  on  electronic  resources. Because electronic resources occupy no shelf space and often are used from remote locations, it can be difficult to alert users to new resources at the library and to determine what sort of patron support is needed. This study investigated electronic database awareness and use by 856 USU administrators and teaching faculty. The responses  revealed  the  need  for  greater  publicity  regarding  new  acquisitions,\r\ntraining opportunities, and methods of remote access. Unexpectedly, the survey itself, with its accompanying descriptions of databases and access methods, met many of the needs it identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKarla.L.(2002)39 carried out a study entitled “Evaluative Usage-based Metrics for the Selection of E-journals”. To measure the value of print journals, librarians have gathered a range of statistics and developed a variety of metrics. Similar work to assess the value of e-journals has just begun. This article explores the usefulness of available e-journal usage statistics and develops three metrics and three benchmarks based on those metrics. The proposed metrics build on earlier work that assesses the value of print journals, although the earlier work is modified extensively to fit the e-journal arena. The e-journal statistics and metrics are further \r\ntransformed to address a completely new area of application: the evaluation of potential purchases. Statistics and metrics are used to build three benchmark measures for assessing e-journal candidates for purchase. A comparison of Science and Nature site licenses illustrates the utility of the assessment benchmarks. The benchmarks, metrics, and statistics developed here provide a reliable framework for assessing both current collections and candidate collections of e-journals. Implications for standards development are clear; content measures are desperately needed for the development of an effective suite of e-journal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNatarajan (2010)40 carried out a study entitled “Use and user perception of electronic resources in Annamalai University: a case study”. Survey of 117 faculty members and research scholars on use and user perception of electronic resources in Annamalai University reveals that despite the availability of wide range of e- resources the frequency of their use was low. The reasons identified for this are lack of time, lack of awareness, lack of subject coverage; and slow downloading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingh (2009) 41 carried out a study entitled “Use of internet based e- resources at Manipur University: a survey”. Describes a survey on the use of the electronic information focusing on the Internet services by the users of Manipur University Library. Also examines the utilization, purpose, difficulties and satisfaction level of users about Internet based e-resource services provided by the library. Finds that low speed internet access, erratic power supply and lack of required full text journals are problems with regard to the use of internet based e- resource. \r\nMukherjee(2010)42 carried out a study entitled   “Use of UGC-Infonet e- journals by research scholars of the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi: A case study”. Attempts to identify the users’ requirement of online journals in general and to know the use of online journals that are available through UGC-Infonet e- journals consortium in particular. A questionnaire survey was conducted amongst\r\n100 research scholars of various departments like history, political science, sociology, psychology and economics at the Faculty of Arts, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.  Reveals that there is a demand for more e-journal titles although  a  substantial  number  of  users  (61.90  percent)  are  satisfied  with  the existing  model  of  UGC-Infonet  Consortium.   Concludes  that  comprehensive training on availability and usability would be of great help to the users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiradar(2009)43  carried out a study entitled  “Use of information sources and services in library of Agriculture Science College, Shimoga: a case study”. Survey  of  101(84.16%)  students  belonging  to  Agriculture  Science  College, Shimoga to study the frequency, purpose of visit to the library and the usefulness of agriculture science periodicals reveals that 77.22% of respondents visit library everyday. About eighty eight percent students visit library to read journals and magazines followed by visits to borrow books (87.12%). It was found that a large\r\nnumber of users use books followed by periodicals. As far as usefulness of periodicals  is  concerned  users  opined  that  The  Indian  Journal  of  Agriculture Science (62.92%) and Karnataka Journal of Agriculture Science (60.67%) are the most useful journals. Concludes that emphasis needs to be given for subscribing online periodicals through e-consortia \r\nSunil Kumar(2010)44, This paper aims to assess and evaluate the use of e- resources  by  the  faculty  members  of  C.V.  Raman  College  of  Engineering (CVRCE), Bhubaneswar, with a view to examine the exposure of faculty members to e-resources. Besides, it aims to highlight the problems encountered by the users and suggests some remedial measures for its improvement. The authors investigate the use of e-resources by the faculty members of CVRCE through a survey based on a structured questionnaire. Various statistical methods have been used for data analysis. The study confirmed that faculty members are aware of the e-resources and various types of e-resources, e-database, and e-journals. It suggests for the\r\nimprovement in the access facilities with high Internet speed and subscription to more e-resources by the Central Library of CVRCE.\r\n\r\nKumari. H.(2009)45 carried out a study entitled   “Use of information resources in chemistry: a study of Mangalore University” .Through a questionnaire survey, data collected from 138 users from the Department of Chemistry, Mangalore University revealed that majority of the users visit the library to borrow books, to consult periodicals and browse UGC INFONET journals. OPAC and the assistance of the library staff are the primary means to locate information. The library resources in chemistry are current and useful but the periodicals both primary and secondary are inadequate. Concludes that various findings of the present study serve as guiding principles in developing need based collection and\r\nprovide effective services to the users’ community of the department of chemistry of the Mangalore University in particular and paves the way for conducting similar studies in other disciplines. \r\nGowda(2009)46  carried out a study entitled “Attitude of research scholars towards usage of electronic information resources: a survey of university libraries in   Karnataka”.   Questionnaire   method   was   employed   to   gather   data   from researchers of humanities, social science and science disciplines in six universities in Karnataka. Responses received from 845 research scholars shows that in general the research scholars prefer print resources and there exists significant differences in the preference of print and electronic resources among various disciplines. Identifies the gaps in the need and availability of electronic resources like online journals  and  databases  in  the  university  libraries.  Reveals  that  the  electronic\r\nresources have created a positive hope among the research community in searching the information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNazima (2008)47  carried out a study entitled “Open access journals and institutional repositories: practical need and present trends in India”. Trends in open access publishing in India are discussed. Data was collected from directories of  open   access   journals   and   institutional   repositories.  The   URL   of   each institutional repository and open access journals was visited to collect relevant data and information including from earlier studies. Case study method was used to know the trends of open access publishing in India. Data is analyzed based on\r\ncertain parameters, such as number of institutional repositories and open access journals, number of documents, software used, types of documents, etc. Among the top 25 open access publishing countries, India ranks 12th for the overall number of journals, but drops to 18th for journals with online content. However, its position in the list of open access journals is fifth. At present India ranks 12th in the list of \r\ncountries with registered interoperable archives in the Registry of Open Access\r\n\r\nRepositories (ROAR).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFatima   (2008)48    carried   out   a   study   entitled   “Information   seeking behaviour of the students at Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College, Aligarh Muslim University: a survey”. Study of data collected from 60 students by administering questionnaires on their information seeking behaviour at Ajmal Khan Tibbiya College, AMU, indicates that guidance in the use of library resources and services is necessary to help students meet their information requirements. Finds that textbooks  and  journals  are  the  most  popular  sources  of  information  for  the students’ course work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBhat (2008)49 carried out a study entitled “Use of web based sources in scholarly electronic journals in the field of library and information science: a citation analysis”. Citation analysis of research articles from scholarly electronic journals in the field of library and information science published during the years\r\n2000 to 2006 shows that 81.49% of articles published during the period have web references. Out of 25,730 references, 56.54% of references are print journal references and 43.52% of them are web references.\r\n.\r\n\r\nSujatha(2008)50 carried out a study entitled “Use of electronic information sources at the College of Fisheries, Mangalore, India”. Examines the use of electronic information sources (EIS) by the teachers/scientists, research scholars and postgraduate students in the College of Fisheries, Mangalore. A survey was administered  among  the  academic  community  along  with  observations  and \r\ninformal interviews at the College of Fisheries, Mangalore. Demonstrates and elaborates the various aspects of EIS use such as frequency and purpose of EIS use, frequently used EIS, methods of learning to use EIS, benefits of EIS use, constraints faced in the use of EIS and the satisfaction level of users in the use of EIS. Suggestions have been given to strengthen the existing electronic information sources and services and to maximize the use of EIS among the fisheries institution academic community. Electronic information resources play a vital role in the field of fisheries and aquaculture. The librarians are facing many challenges posed by numerous electronic information sources such as CD-ROM databases, online databases  and  web  resources  in  these  areas.  This  article  makes  ah  attempt  to identify and discuss some of the important databases in fisheries and aquaculture research and management.\r\n\r\nNikam  (2007)51   carried  out  a  study  entitled  “Use  of  e-journals  and databases by the academic community of University of Mysore: A survey”. This paper describes the use of e-journals and databases (subscribed by UGC-InfoNet consortium) by the users of University of Mysore. Nearly 200 responses to a survey based on questionnaire have been analyzed and presented. Besides studying the use of e-journals and databases, the paper also examines the utilization and satisfaction levels of users with respect to the e-resources. The role of Information Communication Division (ICD) of the University of Mysore in informing the users about the availability of these resources is also discussed. Use of internet as an alternative to UGC InfoNet consortium resources is presented. \r\nNair,  R.  Raman  (2007)52   carried  out  a  study  entitled  “Information resources on agricultural economics: A study with special reference to Kerala”. Opines that scientific planning for agricultural development to overcome backwardness is very important for India. Speedy and sustainable agricultural development is tied closely to effective planning which in turn rests heavily on information available for the process. Information specifically related to this area is classified under agricultural economics. This makes information systems on agricultural economics very crucial in the context of increasing requirements for food  grains  as  well  as  globalization.  Examines  the  coverage  of  agricultural\r\neconomics, nature of information on the area, and the importance of technical and marketing information to managers, farmers and other stakeholders to take maximum advantage of the WTO Regime. Examines in detail the resources of information  units  of  organizations  dealing  with  agricultural  economics  in  the region and the provisions for resource-sharing between them. Reveals that information resources available collectively are sufficient, but that at individual institutions are  not  adequate,  full or  reliable. Recommends  a  resource  sharing programme for institutions concerned with agricultural economics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKrishnan, Jayaja (2007)53 carried out a study entitled “Media resources collection organization and management– An Overview (CEC Media Library-As an example)”. Provides an overview of the organization and management of Media Resources Collection in Media Libraries with example of how it is organized at Media Library of the Consortium for Educational Communication (CEC), New Delhi. It informs the readers how the applications and convergence of Information Communication  Technologies  (ICT)  helps in distribution and  dissemination of \r\nknowledge resources in a converged environment. The advancements and developments in ICT have made possible information access and retrieval much faster in present times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPujar,   S.M,   Sangam,   S.L   (2007)54    carried   out   a   study   entitled “Information use by economists: A study”. Discusses the information use pattern of Indian economists in the present Internet era. Highlights the use of various types of resources, including institutional resources and role of NASSDOC in providing various services to social scientists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarol Tenopir,(2003)55 carried out a study entitled “ Use and Users of Electronic Library Resources: An Overview and Analysis of Recent Research Studies” Academic faculty and graduate students read the most, and they readily use electronic journals accessible from their office or home, but scientists in government laboratories and companies also rely on electronic and paper journals for research. Students prefer to access electronic resources through the library from home. Users in medical libraries read from fewer journal titles than do general university  or  college  users.  There  is  little  evidence  that  gender  in  most cultures makes a difference in use of electronic resources, although in the DLF/CLIR/Outsell studies, women report more use of electronic journals and men use Web search engines more often to locate journals. \r\n2.3 REVIEW OF TRADITIONAL RESOURCES AND ELECTRONICS RESOURCES\r\n\r\nKacherki(2010)56 carried out a study entitled “Print vs e-Journal and Information Seeking Patterns of Users: A Case Study of SPJIMR”. The developments in information technology have made drastic changes in the way the information is collected, stored, retrieved, and distributed. Electronic journal is one of the products of information and communication technologies. The advancement of e-journal during recent years has given librarians a powerful new resource to support learning and research. With availability of both forms of journals in the library,  it  has  become  necessary  to  compare  and  evaluate  effectiveness  of  e- journals and print journals from users’ and library’s’ point of view. The paper discusses a case study done at SP Jain Institute of Management and Research to\r\n\r\nfind out the information-seeking patterns of the library users. The paper also discusses advantages and disadvantages of e-journals and suggests that printed and e-journals are complimentary to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKathleen Bauer (2001)57 carried out a study entitled “Indexes as Tools for Measuring Usage of Print and Electronic Resources”. Libraries are experiencing rapid change as they add electronic resources. These resources are popular with patrons, but their usage is not captured in traditional library statistics. Libraries must find a way to represent the diverse data available for electronic resources in some meaningful way that allows for comparison with statistics for print resources. To do this, the Cushing/Whitney Medical Library has created two indexes, the Electronic and Print Usage Indexes. An index is a simple tool that combines data \r\non items from a group into one number and so represents overall change in the group. The indexes at Cushing/Whitney show that in 1998–1999, patron usage of electronic resources more than doubled, whereas print use declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTammy R. (2004)58 carried out a study entitled “Print versus Electronic Journal  Use  in  Three  Sci/Tech  Disciplines:  What’s  Going  On  Here?”  An evaluation of journal use statistics at Washington State University was undertaken to determine if the selection of electronic journals in the Owen Science and Engineering Library was changing student and researchers’ choice of journals. Use statistics showed that most print journals were being used more than they were prior to the advent of electronic journals. Generally, electronic journals were used heavily and the availability of electronic format greatly enhanced the total use of most titles. However, some electronic journals were used little or not at all, and\r\nthere was a substantial increase in the use of some print titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShawn V. (2003)59 carried out a study entitled “Caught in the Web: The Impact of Library Instruction on Business Students’ Perceptions and Use of Print and Online Resources”. Many business students rely heavily on the Web for research, in part because of their unfamiliarity with the breadth of their library’s business resources (online and in print). This study sought to determine whether library instruction could impact undergraduate business students’ attitudes and use of three information formats: print materials, library databases, and Web resources. Over the course of a semester, pre-/post instruction questionnaires were collected from ninety students enrolled in a business capstone course. Results indicate that \r\nafter library instruction, students held more favorable attitudes toward print resources and used them in their research more than they had initially expected.\r\n\r\nGerke (2010)60  “The Physical and the Virtual: The Relationship between Library as Place and Electronic Collections ”.A statistical analysis of responses to a LibQUAL+™ survey at the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB) was conducted to investigate factors related to patrons’ satisfaction with electronic collections. It was found that a respondent’s discipline was not related to his or her satisfaction with the Libraries’ electronic collection, nor was the frequency with which  the respondent  used  the  Libraries’  facilities  or  used  commercial  search engines. The factors significantly related to users’ satisfaction with electronic collections were the frequency with which they used the Libraries’ Web site, and, most interestingly, the physical library they most often visited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKimball (2010)61 This study compares usage figures between equivalent e- books and print books owned by the Texas A&M University Libraries in the physical sciences and technology. For NetLibrary, the top 10 science e-books were used over six times more than the print books, and the top 10 chemistry e-books were used over three times more than their print counterparts. For e-library, the top\r\n17 science e-books were used at least 17 times more than the same print books. In Safari, the top 10 computer science e-books were used 207 times more than their print counterparts. Usage statistics such as these can help librarians make informed e-book purchase decisions, especially in times of retrenchment. \r\nRobert  (2010)62   discusses  with  the  advent  of  e-journal  preservation projects and ,publisher digitization of journal back files, academic libraries have begun to move their corresponding print volumes of these titles to storage to avoid duplication and save space. This article examines the supporting justifications, outreach   mechanisms,   and   logistical   procedures   undertaken   at   American University Library to relocate the entire bound journal collection to offsite storage in order to address severe physical space constraints and to support patron use of and preference for electronic journal content. In addition, the article presents preliminary data regarding the use of bound volumes sent to storage and an overall\r\nanalysis of this transformational project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan, Pamela S (2010)63 discusses a research study about the impact of the acquisition of electronic medical texts on the usage of equivalent print books in an academic medical library. The researchers conducted four usage studies. They found substantial and increased usage of electronic books compared with the usage of print books, while usage of print texts both in the reserve collection and in the general collection decreased from 1998 to 2009. The number of e-books in the STAT Ref package increased annually from 2003-06. Analysis also showed that the acquisition of the electronic version of a medical title had little impact on the usage of the equivalent print version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobb, Beth G. Hicks, Elaine R. (2010)64 Providing both print and electronic access to journals in a small hospital library is no longer possible, but what is the best way to adjust services? An evaluation plan was developed to assess print journal use and guide decisions regarding format purchases. \r\nLippincott, Joan K (2007)65 describes that Print and digital resources can have creative and interesting relationships; they do not need to reside in separate worlds. Libraries can play a role in working with faculty and students in promoting use of print resources to create new digital products and can be partners in creating learning objects that incorporate primary source materials from the library. Librarians can use the digital environment to create exhibits, displays, and community activities that encourage the use of print materials from the library. These are some of the synergies that can be promoted through the combined use of print and digital resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKrishna (2010).66 A detailed study has been made with help of data collected from 188 users of Mody Institute of Technology and Science (MITS). For this a questionnaire method has been used to know the users response about different aspects of reading habits. All the data pertaining to present study has been analyzed into tables for final interpretations. The study has also been made on different characteristics concerned with print/digital/electronic resources. The various characteristics like attractiveness, portability, need of power supply, infrastructure required, speedy and time savvy, money savvy, up to date information; reliable information and flexibility, etc are taken into consideration\r\nfor study. The purpose of this study is to know the various approaches for reading habits. Frequency of use of library: Types of reading material used by users, Awareness of E-resources among the users, users approach for information access through Internet, satisfaction of users for E resources, limitations of reading habits in print/digital media access. \r\nAgboola, Idayat Odunola(2010)67  covers the two-part questionnaire was designed  to  elicit  information  on  use  of  print  and  electronic  resources  by agricultural  science  students  in  Nigerian  universities.  912  respondents  from faculties of agriculture in three Nigerian universities completed the questionnaires. The results revealed that agricultural science students most prefer to use textbooks (42.1%) among print materials, while The Essential Electronic Agricultural Library (TEEAL) is the most preferred among electronic resources available in their libraries  (52.2%).  Major  problems  faced  by  the  agricultural  science  students include inadequate access to full Internet connectivity and lack of skills on their\r\npart to use available electronic databases properly. The study recommends restructuring library collections by increasing the number of agricultural textbooks and  databases  to  meet  the  information  use  and  retrieval  needs  of  agricultural science students. Other recommendations include establishing Internet-ready computer centers to complement teaching, learning, and research in the library.\r\n\r\nDe Groote (2008)68  Purpose of the research assesses the impact of online journals on citation patterns by examining whether researchers were more likely to limit the resources they cited to those journals available online rather than those only in print. Publications from a large urban university with a medical college at an urban location and at a smaller regional location were examined. The number of online journals available to authors on either campus was the same. The number of print  journals  available  on  the  large  campus  was  much  greater  than  the  print journals available at the small campus. The methodology of searches by author affiliation from 1996 to 2005 were performed in the Web of Science to find all articles written by affiliated members in the college of medicine at the selected \r\ninstitution. Cited references from randomly selected articles were recorded, and the cited journals were coded into five categories based on their availability at the study institution: print only, print and online, online only, not owned, and dropped. Results were analyzed using SPSS. The age of articles cited for selected years as well as for 2006 and 2007 was also examined. And the find are number of journals cited each year continued to increase. On the large urban campus, researchers were not more likely to cite journals available online or less likely to cite journals only in print. At the regional location, at which the number of print-only journals was minimal, use of print-only journals significantly decreased. Conclusion/Discussion: The citation of print-only journals by researchers with access to a library with a large print and electronic collection appeared to continue, despite the availability of potential alternatives in the online collection. Journals available in electronic format were cited more frequently in publications from the campus whose library had a small print collection, and the citation of journals available in both print and electronic formats generally increased over the years studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobinson   (2010)69    reviews   that   are   printed   reference   sources   and references desks are still vital parts of reference service in some libraries, while in others innovative models such as roving reference and learning commons thrive. While undergraduate student’s preferences and usage has shifted from print to electronic, students still need to learn the application of Meta cognitive thinking skills in library research. Updating how reference is delivered to accommodate students' emphasis on mobility and expectation of access to information has led to revitalizing reference collections, reconfiguring space as learning commons and roving  reference  as  solutions  at  Taylor  University  and  Palm  Beach  Atlantic \r\nUniversity, while Whitworth University retains a more traditional configuration to meet student research needs.\r\n\r\nKieft,  Bob  (2010)70   the  article  discusses  the  collection  management methods of college libraries concerning monographs. The author explains the changes increased digitization have on collections in academic libraries, and examines key components in the renewal of monograph collections, citing steps taken by Occidental College in Los Angles, California, such as planning for storing and archiving academic journals, and focusing on the growth of electronic collections rather than traditional book and print collections. Patron-driven acquisition programs, changes book vending companies such as YBP are initiating in reaction to the popularity of electronic books (e-books), and the roles of college libraries as teaching facilities are also included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZimerman, Martin (2010)71 the purpose of this paper is to describe how the tipping point may have been reached with regard to the transition of periodicals between   print   and   electronic.   The   methodology   of   the   literature   search encompassed articles on the transition of periodicals between print and electronic status. The finding are the libraries will soon have to decide, based on budget, what is affordable in terms of periodicals. Vendors are integral to this process and libraries need to negotiate skillfully with them in order to keep costs in line. Electronic resources will serve researchers well, since they provide easy computerized access (searching, cut and paste) to materials previously only found in print. The limitations are a dichotomy of feelings represented in the literature on the transition of journals from print to electronic. Most of the literature seems to \r\nindicate that the move to electronic journals is good for researchers. The Practical implications are move to electronic resources will provide a rich base of digital literature that was not available to researchers before, and this will result in upgraded efforts at publication. Searching electronically can be an enormous timesaver and provides a previously unknown range of searching.\r\nThe value of the research includes examples of what experts in the field suggest to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWebster,  Keith  (2010)72    the  article  offers  the  author's  insights  on electronic reference sources. The author mentions that internet-based reference resources have many advantages over their printed equivalents. The author also adds that the reference resources allow simultaneous use, provide safety from theft or deterioration, can be easily updated and can be located easily. The author also argues that printed reference materials have long life but its nature and location will change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRitchie,  Genoni  (2007)73   the  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  explore  the evolving balance between the use of print and electronic sources for answering reference questions. The methodology is a review of the international literature from the mid-1990s is conducted. A case study of reference questions received at the Northern Territory Library is undertaken, by auditing data held in the online reference information management system. Over 620 questions are categorized according  to  the  sources  used  in  responding  to  those  questions.  The  Results indicate that print and electronic sources are both important to the reference service at the Northern Territory Library. The research limitations are great difficulty in \r\nassessing what constitutes a ‘correct’ balance between print and electronic sources for responding to reference questions, and the current practice is likely to differ significantly between libraries. The results of the study are discussed in terms of their  implications  for  the  future  of  reference  services  and  the  education  and training needs of reference librarians. From the results of this study, coupled with data gathered from the review of international literature, it is possible to identify trends and issues influencing reference services and collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlater, Robert (2010)74  expresses that the E-books have yet to assume a significant place in academic library collections. This article focuses on extracting common themes from the literature that might help the reader better understand why e-books have not yet become the cornerstone of the academic library. Patrons do not use e-books because they find the experience of using e-books incongruous with their experience of using other electronic resources, and many of the unexpected limitations they encounter when using e-books are not inherent to the format. Most often, they are purposefully imposed limitations tied to digital rights management techniques. Librarians do not purchase e-books because the titles they\r\nwant to acquire are often not available electronically, because they are priced or packaged in a way that makes them less appealing than their print counterparts, or because acquiring e-books does not easily integrate into their normal acquisitions workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorlin(2000)75    expresses   that   traditional   reference   services,   where librarians gives the users the right or wrong answers to questions, has slowly begun to change. With the emergence of electronic resources, digitalization, World Wide \r\nWeb resources, and full text databases, many students need more of a consultation on where to get started than on which option is correct. Librarians at Arizona University Libraries strive to help students gain user sufficiency and information literacy. When on the reference desk, they tend to teach rather than do the work for the students. As the libraries are customer centered, it was decided to conduct an evaluation of its reference services. The evaluation involved using a combination of surveys, focus groups, and unobtrusive observation worksheets with a small sample of students. The results were very meaningful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBargellini(2001)76  shows Distance learning can be defined, in the most general terms, as a method of education that involves an instructor and student(s), who are separated geographically and must rely on one or more methods of long- distance communication. It is the direct descendant of correspondence and home study  courses  that  were  developed  in  the  nineteenth  century.  What  is  new, however, is the wealth of telecommunications and telemetries options available today that enable the provision of this high-tech educational environment and the enlargement of the potential user base. Libraries have a central role in education, learning, and vocational training in support of increasing knowledge. The rapid\r\nevolution of information and communication technology in the learning field imposes supports and stimulates the re-engineering of the library. This paper provides a description of a new distance learning scenario in a library service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip Barker(1986)77 In the context of information storage and sharing new electronic technology has much to offer conventional library systems. A video disc can be a valuable storage component. However, its full potential is unlikely to \r\nbe realised if it is used in isolation from other equipment. Computers, communication networks and video discs can together provide many novel information storage and dissemination systems for use in libraries. This paper describes some of these and also gives a brief outline of some approaches to providing the all important user interface to such systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR.P Kumar(1993)78 describe that in India is one of the oldest civilizations with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved  multi- faceted socio-economic progress during the last 43 years of its independence. As the seventh largest country in the world, India is well marked off from the rest of Asia by mountains and the sea, which gives the country a distinct geographical entity. India comprises twenty five states and seven union territories. India has made commendable progress in the technological, engineering and communication fields. Modern technologies are applied to information handling. Production of hardware and software technology is domestic. National resources are augmented\r\nby  establishing  links  with  the  international  systems.  There  are  106  medical colleges, and 40 dental colleges in India. Besides this, there are nursing colleges, pharmacy colleges and other institutions. Each college/institution has a library of its own attached to it. The libraries can be classified into Medical, Research, Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Dental, Unani and Pharmaceutical Libraries. A survey was carried out on the usage of modern technologies in health sciences libraries example Photocopiers, microfilming, computers, facsimile transmission, audiovisual,  online  searching  and  CD-ROM  in  the  form  of  a  questionnaire. Personal visits were made to a number of libraries and some of the librarians were also  interviewed.  This  paper  examines  the  impact  of  modern  technologies  on \r\nmedical libraries, and concludes with the problems faced by the librarians in adopting the modern technologies and suggests the need and measures for implementation of modern technologies to health science libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrances Schofield 79  expresses that the people's network (PN) aims to ensure the provision of free and open access to Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) through public libraries. This paper compares the usage of a PN converted library to an original learning centre. It was found that a wide range of people from different age groups and backgrounds use the ICT facilities. The results also indicated that both libraries had been successful in providing access to ICTs for people who would otherwise have had no access, although the age of the technology available in the more established learning centre had a negative impact on  users,  and  the  take-up  of  online  learning  opportunities  had  not  been  as\r\nprominent as would be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOlayinka Catherine Fatoki(2006)80 describe that the GSM technologies acceptance and growth rate among the Nigerian populace has serious and great potentials for enhancing the communication and information technology-related services in libraries  and information  centers in  Nigeria. However,  information managers need to fully exploit the opportunities presented by this relatively new phenomenon  with  a view  to  providing  improved  products  and  services  to the library users, especially in the academic sector.\r\nDamaris Odero-Musakali(2005)81 expresses that the potential advantages\r\n\r\nof the internet appear to have precluded the foresight of Kenyan university libraries to the challenges that may be associated with its deployment. There is clear under- \r\nutilization and considerable disparities between and within the libraries in their levels of general Information and Communication Technology (ICT) deployment and use in Kenya. Most public university libraries still use conventional methods of service provision, suggesting that most library employees are not ready to embrace and integrate these information technologies in their routine operations. If promising ICT applications cannot be widely deployed, then the benefits resulting from such technologies are likely to be equally curtailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah Ormes(2007)82  considers this paper explores some of the issues surrounding the development of Internet services in public library children's services. It notes that IT services have generally been undeveloped in children's libraries and that this trend must not continue with networked computer services. It recognises that the lack of net-worked computer service provision in children's libraries may lead to them seeming ‘irrelevant’ and ‘old fashioned’ to their users. The paper focuses on literature and literacy issues in relation to information and communication technology (ICT). It notes that few libraries have been using ICT to  support  their  literature-based  services.  One  possible  service  model  for  the\r\nintegration of ICT into literature services, UKOLN's Treasure Island Web site, is described and the results of an evaluation of it interpreted. The paper concludes looking forward to the Stories from the Web project which will develop the Treasure Island model further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNancy K. Herther(1998)83  the purpose of this article is to advocate for a broader discussion of potential needs for better communication and theory in the areas  of  technological  adoption,  management  and  application  in  libraries  and \r\ninformation  centers.    From  personal  readings,  reflection,  experience  and  the insights of others in the field, the paper considers movements in the larger library and information science (LIS) theoretical literature and its potential application to technology issues.  Numerous areas of potential future research and action in the field  are  identified  to  stimulate  further  discussion  and  efforts.  Although  these newer theoretical discussions have stimulated research and reflection in the few, few discussions have been made in the information technology arena, an area ripe for such consideration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPadmini Srinivasan(1998)84 It is well understood that knowledge management is extremely important in order to achieve the goals and aspirations of research communities. Traditional knowledge management methods linking different knowledge resources are now being augmented by newer models and methods that have excellent potential benefits. The new innovations typically involve creative combinations of technology, human expertise and communication models. Innovations such as digital libraries have attracted significant attention, especially in the publishing industry. Some of these projects have made the transition from prototypes to production systems, enabling relatively quick and\r\nreliable access to research publications. Other innovations such as “Push Technology” or information filtering promise a level of maturity that could offer researchers a constellation of automatic electronic agents that assist with highly specialized aspects of the research process. This paper examines developments in some of these innovations and their potential for researchers. \r\nSandra Sharp(2005)85 expresses that The library services has developed a learning plan offering different levels of access to information and communication technologies to give the opportunities to all and are trying to expand on provision to learning and information technology to vulnerable and hard to reach groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel  Spacey, 86   a  consideration  of  the  implications  of  technological change for public library staff and managers in the UK is based on the selected results of a literature review. Recent developments affecting the growth of information and communication technology (ICT) in public libraries provide a context against which research into the effects of automation, the introduction of ICT in a variety of library environments and into society generally, are explored. The values of attitudes to ICT are questioned noting that attitudes are often seen as being important in determining the successful implementation of ICT in libraries. Training is suggested as an appropriate means of enabling staff to cope effectively\r\nwith technological change. Successful training needs to appreciate that staff have different needs and so prefer different training methods. Resistance is also viewed as a natural response to change that managers should note and attempt to understand, if and when it occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHudron K. Kari(2003)87 discusses that the empirical findings of the research are as follows: about 80 per- cent of Nigerians live in rural areas and are predominantly poor farmers and fishermen, of whom about 90 percent are illiterate in the Western sense. They lack basic information infrastructures such as internet, libraries and information centres, and electricity. The oral tradition is still prevalent and written communication remains elusive because a majority of the populace is \r\nstill illiterate. Rural dwellers show positive response to the services of information agents such as agricultural extension workers, rural health workers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Olu Adeyoyin(2007)88 expresses that that the result of the findings showed that out of about 370 professional librarians, only 179 of them were ICT literate while the remaining 191 professional librarians were ICT non-literate. This constitutes an overall percentage of 48.38 percent for the literate professionals as against 51.62 percent for ICT non-literate professionals. Also, out of 526 paraprofessionals, only 84 of them were ICT literate while the remaining 442 were ICT non-literate. This also constitutes 15.97 percent for the literate paraprofessionals as against 84.03 percent for ICT non-literate paraprofessionals. Other staff totaled 1,471. Only 190 of them were ICT literate while the remaining\r\n1,281 were ICT non-literate. This also constitutes 12.92 percent for the literate other members of staff as against 87.08 percent for ICT non-literate other members of staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSheila Corrall(1995)89 analyses the way that higher education library services are viewed, planned and managed must change radically if they are to survive and thrive in the future. Advances in technology, economic and political pressures, and socio-demographic factors have combined to create an environment posing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The Joint Funding Councils' Libraries Review has highlighted the need for stronger management and more confident involvement in institutional planning and organizational change. Electronic communication will transform service provision, with significant shifts towards distributed networked services, empowering the end-user and offering new \r\nroles and responsibilities to information intermediaries. Effective communication between library, computing and academic staff will be essential to ensure relevant and responsive services. New resource models will be required to take account of diverse customer needs and different modes of delivery. Organizational structures and management styles must change to meet future needs and human resource development must be given higher priority. Bold leadership will enable libraries to enhance their strategic role and respond positively to environmental change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRowena Cullen(2003)90  expresses that the phrase “Digital Divide” has been applied to the gap that exists in most countries between those with ready access to the tools of information and communication technologies (ICTs), and those without such access or skills. This may be because of socio-economic or geographical factors, educational, attitudinal and generational factors, or because of physical disabilities. The paper reviews recent research concerning the digital divide in New Zealand, and the factors that alienate people from enjoying the benefits of information technology and participation in the knowledge economy. While socio-economic factors affect use of ICTs by urban Maori and Pacific Island\r\ncommunities,  and  rural  communities  are  affected  by  inadequate telecommunications infrastructure, rural Maori are even more disadvantaged. The paper examines strategies used in the USA and the UK at national and regional levels to address similar issues, including the use of libraries to reduce the digital divide,  and  compares  these  with  New  Zealand  initiatives,  to  identify  positive means of increasing participation in the knowledge economy. \r\nRita Marcella(2003)91 discusses the second stage of a pilot study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, which investigated the impact of technology on  the communication of  parliamentary information  to  the  general public. This second stage tested the application of a new data collection tool – an interactive, electronically assisted interview delivered in a road show environment. The approach was tested in the context of the public's need for information about the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. Interviews were carried out by a researcher, aboard a minibus equipped with a laptop and mobile data transmission equipment, who assisted members of the\r\npublic in exploring and responding to parliamentary and devolved Assembly Websites. Roadshows took place across the UK at organisations such as public libraries, community centres, sheltered accommodation and universities. Discusses in critical detail all aspects of the execution of the methodology and draws conclusions as to its validity for future research.\r\n\r\nSuzie   Allard(2002)92    shows   knowledge   creation   relies   on   melding powerful technological tools with efficient human organizations. Digital libraries (DLs) provide the technological mechanisms to cross national and disciplinary boundaries,  and  promote  an  organizational  structure  that  encourages communication   between   scholars   who   are   both   creating   and   consuming information. The DL is especially good at coordinating and integrating findings about a specific topic that is being studied by different disciplines and different nations, which is an essential component to further our knowledge. This paper will briefly outline the knowledge creation process, and will introduce the author’s SEEK model (Structure for Encompassing Extensible Knowledge) that provides a \r\nframework for exploring the relationship between technology and human organizations in international interdisciplinary knowledge creation. The paper will also introduce two models of electronically-based scholarly organizations that promote international collaboration and facilitate knowledge creation, and will offer eight steps towards building the effective organization for utilizing DLs for international collaboration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

A pre- planned and well – described method will provide the researcher a scientific and feasible plan for attacking and solving the problem under investigation.  Mouly has classified research methods into three main categories namely historical method, survey method and experimental method.\r\nThe investigator has adopted survey method of research to study the utilization of traditional resources and e-resources in higher education – a comparative study on user point of view.   Survey research is a procedure in which information is systematically collected from a population through some form of direct solicitation such as face to face interview, administering questionnaire.\r\nA worthwhile survey study can collect three types of information.\r\n\r\n1.   Of what exists by studying and analyzing important aspects of the present situation. \r\n2.   Of what we want by clarifying goals and objectives possibly through a study of  the  conditions  existing  elsewhere  or  what  experts  consider  being desirable.\r\n3.   Of how to get these through discovering the possible means of achieving the goals on the basis of the experiences of others or the opinions of experts.\r\nThe present study is to know the utilization of traditional resources and e- resources in higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.5 SCOPE OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\nFor any type of research work, scope is more essential. Without scope, the researcher cannot collect the data in a stipulated time. In this research work, the utilization of traditional resources and e-Rresources in higher education of selected universities namely Madurai Kamaraj University, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Bharathiyar University, Bharathidasan University of Tamil Nadu have been selected for this study.\r\nResources available in the traditional and e-resources of above mentioned universities, library users are taken in to account. The research work stresses on usage of traditional and e-Resources of library.\r\nThe significant difference in the utilisation of the two resources namely traditional and e-resources is the major study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.6 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\n1)  The boundary of the research work is limited to four selected universities of Tamil Nadu namely Madurai Kamaraj University, Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, Bharathiyar University, Bharathidasan University. \r\n2)  Since the population was more, the researcher has taken only 765 respondents samples.\r\n3) The researcher found the little hardship while collecting data from the respondents, since they were busy other works also.\r\n4)  The  resources  are  limited  to  Traditional  and  Electronic  resources.  In traditional only printed resource has been considered and the out dated resources like palm leaf, copper plates, clay plates, etc are left out from this study.\r\n5)  The variable subject is categorized in to two i.e Arts, Science for researcher convenience / familiarity with respondents\r\n6) The primary secondary and tertiary resources are limited on the basis of familiarity and frequency of utility.\r\n7)  Apart from the above limitations, the study is deemed to be correct according to the researcher knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.7 POPULATION FOR THE STUDY\r\n\r\nThe population is consisting of students pursuing the higher education of above four selected universities of Tamil Nadu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.8 DESCRIPTION OF THE TOOL\r\n\r\nA brief description of the tool has been presented here. Questionnaire method is used for data collection. The questionnaire format is very easy and simple for respondents. All the users are come to library for some specific purpose. There is not necessary to select all categories by the users. So, the questionnaire construction is the \r\nrespondents can select any one or two or both or may be left out. The left out can treated as non selected users.\r\nA well structured pre-tested questionnaire developed for the purpose. This developed  Questionnaire  are  issued  to  respondents  and  collected  answers  from students  of  four  universities  namely  1)Madurai  Kamaraj  University,(2) Manonmanium Sundaranar University,(3) Bharathidasan University,(4) Bharathiyar University.  While  the  students  are  visiting  the  library,  the  questionnaires  are distributed to students and data are collected.\r\nThe questionnaire consists of six major divisions like 1) Personal data, 2) Preference for information gathering, 3) Accessibility of Resources (General), 4) Accessibility of Resources (specific), 5) keep up to date of current developments and events in your filed 6) viability, 7) Feasibility and prefer to give up printed material if you have access to electronic versions, and 8) Extent of use.\r\nAfter collecting data, they are manipulated and tabulated for finding the results. The filled up questionnaires were arranged by University wise and analyses is taken place based on three variables i.e. Gender, subject and visit.\r\n3.9 SAMPLE FOR THE STUDY\r\n\r\nThe investigator has used random sampling technique for selecting the sample from the population.\r\n.

For researcher convenient 765 respondents were selected for analysis purpose. Among them 346 are male and 419 are female.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.2 SEXWISE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAMPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSex\t\r\nNo. of Students\t\r\nPercentage\r\n\r\nMale\t\r\n346\t\r\n45.23\r\n\r\nFemale\t\r\n419\t\r\n54.77\r\n\r\nTotal\t\r\n765\t\r\n100\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above table shows that there are 45.23% male and 54.77% female users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.3 SUBJECTWISE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAMPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT\t\r\nNo. of Students\t\r\nPercentage\r\n\r\nArts\t\r\n321\t\r\n41.96\r\n\r\nScience\t\r\n444\t\r\n58.04\r\n\r\nTotal\t\r\n765\t\r\n100\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is inferred from the above table that there are 41.96% of respondents are belongs to Arts departments and 58.04% of respondents are belongs to Science departments. \r\n3.10 TOOLS USED\r\n\r\nThe tool used in the present investigation has been constructed by the investigator in consultation with his guide and experts.\r\n3.11 STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES USED\r\n\r\nStatistical techniques are very essential for any research. It will help the investigator  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data.  In  the  present  investigation,  the following statistical techniques are used:\r\nChi-square\r\n\r\nThe chi-square (2) test is used to determine whether there is a significant difference  between  the  expected  frequencies  and  the  observed  frequencies  in\r\nvariables.\r\n \r\n\r\n 2   \r\n \r\n(O  E)2\r\nE \r\n\r\nWhere,\r\n\r\n 2            =         Chi-square\r\n\r\nO         =         Observed frequencies\r\n\r\nE         =         Expected frequencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDegrees  Of  Freedom  used  to  find  out  the  significant  difference has  been calculated from the following formula\r\nDegrees Of Freedom = df = (R – 1) (C -1) Where, ‘O’ = Observed Frequency\r\n‘E’ = Expected Frequency\r\n\r\n‘R’ = Number of Rows\r\n\r\n‘C’ = Number of Columns. \r\nANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter deals with the analysis of data collected for the purpose of study. It is discussed in three parts. The part-I deals the analysis with respect to gender, the part-II mainly focuses on to the subject and the part-III mainly deals the frequency of visit. The details have been presented in the following pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2 ANALYSIS OF DATA\r\n\r\nFor this study, the data were collected with regard to utilization of traditional and E-resources in higher education from the user point of view in the selected universities  of  Tamil  Nadu  and  the  data  were  analyzed  with  reference  to  the objectives and hypotheses of the present study.\r\nPART- I\r\n\r\nANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO GENDER\r\n\r\n4.2.1 USING RESOURCES FOR INFORMATION GATHERING\r\n\r\nIt has been broken into smaller ones based on the information gathering as\r\n\r\n1) General Reading,\r\n\r\n2) Research work,\r\n\r\n3) Preparing study material and curriculum plans,\r\n\r\n4) Preparing class notes,\r\n\r\n5) Paper presentation in seminars / workshops,\r\n\r\n6) Updating of subject knowledge were analysed. The details have been presented in the following few pages. \r\nThere is significant difference in using the traditional and e-resources for using resources for information gathering with respect to their gender. For this the gender has been classified as male and female.\r\nTo verify the hypothesis, Chi-square test has been used. The using resources have been classified in to three categories namely traditional resources (T), electronic resources (E) and both traditional resources, electronic resources (TE).\r\n4.2.1.1 GENERAL READING\r\n\r\nTable 4.1\r\nGeneral Reading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENDER\t\r\nRESPONDENTS\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL\r\n\t\r\nT\t\r\nE\t\r\nTE\t\r\n\r\nMALE\t241 (31.50%)\t60 (7.85%)\t45 (5.88%)\t346\r\n(45.23%)\r\n\r\nFEMALE\t266 (34.77%)\t63 (8.24%)\t90 (11.76%)\t419\r\n(54.77%)\r\n\r\nTOTAL\t507\r\n(66.27%)\t123\r\n(16.08%)\t135\r\n(17.65%)\t765\r\n(100%)\r\nSource: Primary data\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above Table 4.1 points out that the total respondents are 765.

This concept is also applicable to library resources. Every stage of technological developments may influence the library resources. From ancient to modern digital era the library resources is met lot of changes in its format. In ancient period leather, clay tablet, wax, copper plates, palm leaf are used for writing materials and also preserved in libraries. After the invention of papers the writing technology improved tremendously. Due to the technological innovations the library resources are slowly change in print form to e form.\r\nThis Study emphasized that maximum number of the users select and using both print and electronic formats for their requirement. This print and e resources are having some advantage and disadvantages. This is a digital era, but still some of the users are given preference to print resources. Because all the resources are not available in e format at the same time all the resources are not avail in print format. Also some users are lack of knowledge on e resources.\r\nBut nowadays maximum information are publishes in the e formats especially e journals and online databases. The E-journals (open access and paid) and online databases are giving a more support to the students, scholars and staff of the academic libraries. So, Librarians as knowledge managers periodically conduct the orientation \r\nprogrammes which are supporting to the users for collect the information in easy manner. This kind of orientation programme will create familiarity and awareness of e resources and new arrivals of the library to the users.  Whether print or e resources are give the support to its users i.e purely based on the searching ability and retrieval skill of the users. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX - I\r\n\r\nBibliography \r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdeyinka Tella ,Adedeji Tella ,C.
