Taiwan has undergone rapid demographic, social, and economic changes, becoming a highly urbanized and industrial society with a growing population of persons age 65 or older. SEBAS explores the relationship between life challenges and mental and physical health, the impact of social environment on the health and well-being of the elderly, as well as biological markers of health and stress. The study collected self-reports of physical, psychological, and social well-being, plus extensive clinical data based on medical examinations and laboratory analyses. Examination of health outcomes included chronic illnesses, functional status, psychological well-being, and cognitive function. Questions regarding life challenges focused on perceived stress, economic difficulties, security and safety, and the consequences of a major earthquake. Biological markers were used to identify cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic process measures, immune-system activity, the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, and sympathetic nervous system activity. Two rounds of biomarker data collected in 2000 and 2006 were complemented by face-to-face interviews with the participants. Demographic and background variables included age, sex, education, ethnicity, occupation, and residency.</p>\n\n<p>Additional information about the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study can

The original 1989 sample was nationally representative of Taiwanese aged 60 and older, including the institutionalized population, and was drawn as a multi-stage probability sample. In 1996, the survey was expanded to include a sample of persons aged 50 to 66 (Cohort A), who were under-sampled relative to the original cohort (Cohort B).  Thus the 1996 survey contains a sample of all Taiwanese aged 50 and above, who were then re-interviewed in 1999.  In 2000, a national sub-sample of respondents to the 1999 wave of the TLSA was selected randomly for the SEBAS.  The sampling plan was an extension of the original design implemented in 1989, with oversampling of urban residents.  Thus, SEBAS 2000 represented a national sample of Taiwanese adults aged 54 and older.  The SEBAS 2006 sample started with the SEBAS 2000 respondents who had completed both the interview and the health exam.  In addition to this panel component, a refresher cohort of those aged 53-60 in 2006 (Cohort C) was added to ensure the SEBAS 2006 comprised a representative cross-section of the Taiwanese population aged 53 and older.  Like in SEBAS 2000, urban residents were oversampled.  The sampling fraction for Cohort C was the same as Cohort A, thus among all three cohorts in the SEBAS 2006, Cohort B (the oldest) is over-represented.
