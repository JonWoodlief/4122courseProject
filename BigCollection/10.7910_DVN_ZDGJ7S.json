Interviews were conducted in four areas of Diepsloot, Johannesburg, Randburg and Yeoville. A total of 128 respondents, comprising of 11 nationalities, were interviewed over a period of three days. Data was collected on purchasing behavior, consumption behavior and willingness to pay. Further on to understand the supply side of the fish activities in the province, traders were interviewed to understand where they sourced their fish from, the selling patterns of the various fish species and the prices that they sold their fish for.\r\nThe study revealed that there were distinct fish preferences between South African nationals and African Diaspora living in South Africa. Most South Africans alluded to not consuming fish as their primary source of animal protein. Observations made in shops indicated that fish was more expensive than poultry; hence poultry being the preferred source, in addition to it being the traditionally consumed animal protein."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Fish Consumption"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Willingness to pay"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/sites/default/files/worldfish-logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Muliro, Jacquie"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-09-04"}]}},"files":[{"description":"STATA data file for Consumption Patterns Market and Value Chain Analysis of Fish in Gauteng Province","label":"Consumption Patterns Market and Value Chain Analysis of Fish in Gauteng Province.tab","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":145742,"categories":["6.
