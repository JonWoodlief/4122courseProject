Those surveyed were asked to describe their views  toward the Catholic Church, specifically whether they endorsed the  Roman Catholic Church policies that priests cannot get married and  that women cannot become priests, whether they agreed with the way the  Catholic Church has dealt w\nith the issue of sexual abuse of children  by Catholic priests, whether such abuse is common, whether the  Catholic Church was taking the proper actions to deal with the issue,  whether this issue had hurt the overall reputation of the Catholic  Church in their eyes, and if so, by how much. Respondents were asked  if they believed Catholic priests were more likely than other men to  sexually abuse children, and if the following policies and practices  were part of the problem: not allowing priests to marry, not allowing  women to be priests, transferring priests accused of sexual abuse to  another parish, not calling the police when a priest was accused of  sexual abuse, being reluctant to dismiss priests because of a shortage  of priests, or the lack of Vatican oversight of the Catholic Church in  the United States. Persons queried were asked whether they approved of  transferring a priest who had been accused of sexually abusing a child  to another parish without telling parishioners about the accusation,  whether the Church should inform parishioners and/or the police about  such charges, and whether the Church should be required to do this by  law. Respondents were then questioned about their overall opinions on  how the Church had handled the issue, as well as their knowledge of  instances in which a Catholic priest had been accused of sexually  abusing children in their community, or instances in which friends or  relatives had been abused by a Catholic priest. Persons of the  Catholic faith were asked how satisfied they were with the leadership  provided by their parish priest or priests, their bishop, and the  Pope, whether the church effectively involved lay people in deciding  church policies, and whether they approved of the way their parish  priest or priests, their bishop, and the national leaders of the  Catholic Church had handled the issue of sexual abuse of children by  priests. Catholic respondents were also asked whether their diocese  should publicly report the amount of money paid to settle lawsuits  against priests accused of sexually abusing children, if their diocese  should publicly release the names of priests who had been accused of  sexually abusing children, whether the issue of sexual abuse of  children by priests had caused them to alter the amount of money they  gave to the Church in donations, if this issue had caused them to  reexamine their personal faith, if they were aware of any priests in  their own parish that have been accused of sexually abusing children,  whether there was a chance that they would leave the Roman Catholic  Church, how likely they were to leave, and if their leaving was  motivated in some way by the issue of sexual abuse by  priests. Non-Catholic persons were asked if they were aware of any  clergy within their religious congregation that had been accused of  sexually abusing children. Additionally, all persons queried were  asked whether they approved of the way President George W. Bush was  handling his job. Background information on respondents includes age,  gender, education, religion, frequency of attendance at religious services, race, and Hispanic origin."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Catholic Church"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Catholic priests"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Catholics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policies and procedures"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"religious attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"religious behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sanctions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
