Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, the United States Congress, Vice President Al Gore, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Congressman Henry Hyde, former White House inte\nrn Monica Lewinsky, and the Democratic and Republican parties. Those queried were asked who they would like to influence the country over the next two years, and what the nation's priorities should be following the conclusion of the Clinton impeachment trial. Respondents were asked a series of questions regarding the ongoing Senate impeachment trial of Clinton, including whether they were following the trial, their opinion of how the Senate was handling the trial, and whether they thought that the Senate would meet the completion deadline of Friday, February 12, 1999. Views were sought on the February 6, 1999, showing of portions of videotaped depositions of Lewinsky, Presidential confidant Vernon Jordan, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal as part of the impeachment trial. Respondents were asked whether they believed that Clinton should be found not guilty, found guilty and removed from office, found guilty and not removed from office, or censured for his actions. An additional question asked whether those queried believed that Clinton can still serve as an effective president. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, religion, education, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, marital status, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
