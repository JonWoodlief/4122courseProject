Deploying data drawn from the 1953-2004 terms of the Court, we show that in disputes in which only First Amendment claims are at issue, the more liberal a justice, the higher the likelihood that she or he will vote in favor of litigants alleging an abridgment of their rights. That relationship, however, fails to emerge in disputes in which other values, such as privacy and equality, are prominently at stake. In these cases, liberal justices are no more likely than their conservative counterparts to support the First Amendment; indeed, if anything, a reversal of sorts occurs, with conservatives more likely and liberals less likely to vote in favor of the speech, press, assembly, or association claim. Taken collectively, these results indicate that a commitment to First Amendment values is no longer a lodestar of liberalism. We consider the implications of these findings in light of long-held assumptions in (quantitative) political science work on the Court."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Lee Epstein, Jeffrey A.
