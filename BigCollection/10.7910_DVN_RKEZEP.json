These packets included the Adjective Check List and a life history questionnaire. Of the 197 alumnae contacted, 109 responded. Of these, 99 completed the life history questionnaires. Eleven of these women also provided detailed oral life stories.<br /><br />  The questionnaire includes questions about demographics, family history and health history. These are followed by sections of open-ended questions about personal history, health, living through the Depression and World War II, work history, and experiences in the post-World War II era including the social revolution of the 1960s, with particular emphasis on the civil rights and feminist movements. In addition, there are questions that elicit comments on the Radcliffe College experience, current issues, and the future of American society. Because the participants in this study were very close in age, the questions were designed to explore historical events as they affected this cohort in particular. For example, there are questions on growing up during the Depression; early marriage, parenting and work during World War II; and on being middle-aged in the 1960s.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study (all 99 of the life history questionnaires, 79 Adjective Check Lists, and transcripts of the 12 oral history interviews. These transcripts are also housed at the Schlesinger Library, along with the interview audiotapes. In addition, the Murray Archive holds 78 anonymously returned questionnaires collected at the class of 1943's 45th reunion and 74 anonymously returned questionnaires collected before the class of 1943's 55th reunion).
