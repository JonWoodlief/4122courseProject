Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling his job as president, whether they approved of the way Bush was handling the war in Iraq, the economy, and the United States campaign against terrorism. Respondents were also asked whether they approved of the way Congress was handling its job and what they thought was the most important problem facing the country. Respondents were asked to rate the condition of the national economy and were asked whether they thought the economy was getting better. Information was collected on a number of questions about health care, whether respondents were satisfied with the quality of health care, whether they were satisfied with the cost of health care,  and whether the United States should have universal health care or keep it the way it is. Respondents were queried on how much attention they had payed to the testimony to Congress by General Petraeus on the state of the war in Iraq and whether they watched or listened to President Bush's speech on the war in Iraq. Opinions were sought on candidates Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, John Edwards, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton. Respondents were then asked whether they were satisfied with the candidates running for the Democratic nomination for president, whether they were satisfied with the candidates running for the Republican nomination for president, whether they thought the United States did the right thing in taking military action against Iraq, whether the United States will succeed in Iraq, and a number of other questions about the troops in Iraq. Respondents were asked whether they thought the United States had a responsibility to make sure that Iraq had a stable government, whether they thought Iraq would have a stable democracy in the next few years, how confident they were that the United States had the ability to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden, and whether they served in the armed forces or had any family members that did.
