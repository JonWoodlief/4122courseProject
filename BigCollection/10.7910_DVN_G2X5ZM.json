This changes have far more reaching implications in I.T industries such as Big data, Artificial intelligence and Agile Software development methodologies. Competition in the software development ecosystem has made developers to build software that are quick and reliable and often referred to as Agile development. Agile transformation is real and requires rethinking the business management, recruitment process and data strategy in a bid to stimulate disruptive solutions from within in-house development and deployment. AI product development would require rapid transformational changes within any organization.  This can be accomplished by establishing specific operating models that permit development teams with the freedom of technology choice. This publication highlights some operating models that can be adopted to improve the success of AI products using Agile software development methodologies."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-10-04"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management","Computer and Information Science","Engineering","Mathematical Sciences","Other"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Agile development, software development, Artificial intelligence, Software developers, Big Data, AI products"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ogbonna, Prince"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-02-26"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Agile Software development, its implication in AI products and developers1.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":150604,"dataFile":{"id":3371555,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Agile Software development, its implication in AI products and developers1.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":703840,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:169295e1262-731ade3bcfc2","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"c92a4309870862aa8606521ae676cada","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"c92a4309870862aa8606521ae676cada"}}}]}}}
