Critics argue that, under conditions of low institutional development, multiparty elections may lead to violence and civil war, rather than to the peaceful allocation of authority that everyone desires. Starting from the premise that elections are strategically timed and endogenous in transitioning authoritarian regimes, i.e., more likely to be held when violence is imminent, we show that for Africa, the continent with the lowest levels of political institutionalization, elections do not increase the probability of a civil war initiation. In fact, for the post-Cold War period, the holding of multiparty elections is actually associated with a substantial reduction in the probability of civil war onset. Our results suggest that the democracy proponents have little reason to worry about holding multiparty elections, even during the early stages of democratization."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-01"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Cheibub, Jose Antonio and Jude Hays. \"Elections and Civil War in Africa.\" Political Science Research and Methods."}}]},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jude Hays"},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"University of Pittsburgh"}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-01"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard Dataverse Network"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard University"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://thedata.harvard.edu"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-01"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-03-01"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Cheibub_Hays_PSRM_Replication.zip","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43023,"dataFile":{"id":2542516,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/29280/VMC8HX","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/29280/VMC8HX","filename":"Cheibub_Hays_PSRM_Replication.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":227820,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:296524","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7653d34d01589deefd22afde38f788d4","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7653d34d01589deefd22afde38f788d4"}}}]}}}
