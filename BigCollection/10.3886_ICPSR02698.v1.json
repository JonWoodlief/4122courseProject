The evaluation consisted of an extensive case study, supplemented by pre- and post-test comparisons of boot camp offenders' attitudes, physical fitness, and literacy skills, descriptive information about their engagement in legitimate activities during aftercare, and an assessment of the rates, timing, and sources of program attrition.
