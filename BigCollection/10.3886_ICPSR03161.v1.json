Additionally, this project sought to compute a dollar value  that individuals would bear in their wages and housing costs to reduce  the rates of specific crimes. The study used multiple decades of  information obtained from counties across the United States to create  a panel dataset. This approach was designed to compensate for the  problem of collinearity by tracking how housing and occupation choices  within particular locations changed over the decade considering  all amenities or disamenities, including specific crime rates. Census  data were obtained for this project from the Integrated Public Use  Microdata Series (IPUMS) constructed by Ruggles and Sobek  (1997). Crime data were obtained from the Federal Bureau of  Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). Other data were collected  from the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association, County  and City Data Book, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  and Environmental Protection Agency. Independent variables for the  Wages Data (Part 1) include years of education, school enrollment,  sex, ability to speak English well, race, veteran status, employment  status, and occupation and industry. Independent variables for the  Housing Data (Part 2) include number of bedrooms, number of other  rooms, building age, whether unit was a condominium or detached  single-family house, acreage, and whether the unit had a kitchen,  plumbing, public sewers, and water service. Both files include the  following variables as separating factors: census geographic division,  cost-of-living index, percentage unemployed, percentage vacant  housing, labor force employed in manufacturing, living near a  coastline, living or working in the central city, per capita local  taxes, per capita intergovernmental revenue, per capita property  taxes, population density, and commute time to work. Lastly, the  following variables measured amenities or disamenities: average  precipitation, temperature, windspeed, sunshine, humidity,  teacher-pupil ratio, number of Superfund sites, total suspended  particulate in air, and rates of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated  assault, burglary, larceny, auto theft, violent crimes, and property crimes."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study aimed to evaluate the explicit costs  of crime to society. There have been two previous approaches to this  problem. First, hedonic models sought to isolate the value individuals  placed on specific amenities or disamenities, such as weather, air  pollution, and crime rates, as seen in the wages they required and the  prices they paid for housing. The second approach evaluated costs by  combining the actual out-of-pocket expenses associated with crime with  the imputed costs from the pain, suffering, and fear of crime. This  data collection combined these two methods to obtain a market-based  estimate for specific crimes. In particular, this project was designed  to isolate the effects that individual crimes have on wage rates (Part  1) and housing prices (Part 2), as gauged by individuals' and  households' decisionmaking preferences changing over time.
