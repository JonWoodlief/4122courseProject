The Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was also a\ndministered in February 2003 (ICPSR 4526) and June 2003 (ICPSR 4527). These three supplements comprise the 2003 wave of TUS data.</p>\n<p>The basic CPS, administered monthly, collects labor force data about the civilian noninstitutional population living in the United States. Moreover, the CPS provides current estimates of the economic status and activities of this population which includes estimates of total employment (both farm and nonfarm), nonfarm self-employed persons, domestics, and unpaid helpers in nonfarm family enterprises, wage and salaried employees, and estimates of total unemployment. Data from the CPS are provided for the week prior to the administration of the survey.</p>\n<p>The TUS, like most CPS supplements, was designed to be a proxy response supplement, meaning a single respondent could provide answers for all eligible household members, provided the respondent was a household member 15 years of age or older. Unique to the TUS design were also a set of self-respondent supplement questions. All household members age 15 years and older who had completed the basic CPS core items were eligible for the November 2003 supplement items.</p>\n<p>The TUS consisted of items PEA1 through PEK5. Self-respondents were eligible for the entire supplement, whereas proxy respondents were only eligible for certain items. Information was collected from proxies on topics such as smoking status (items PEA1-PEA3) and the use of other tobacco-related products, such as pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff (items PEJ1a-PEJ2a).</p>\n<p>In addition to these smoking status and other tobacco use questions, self-respondents were queried on the following topics depending on their smoking/tobacco use status (i.e., every day, some days, or former cigarette smokers and/or users of other non-cigarette tobacco products):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Smoking history</p></li>\n<li><p>Current cigarette smoking prevalence and consumption</p></li>\n<li><p>Type of cigarettes smoked</p></li>\n<li><p>Price of last pack/carton of cigarettes purchased and state where purchased</p></li>\n<li><p>Medical and dental advice to quit smoking</p></li>\n<li><p>Attempts and intentions to quit smoking cigarettes and/or other forms of tobacco use</p></li>\n<li><p>Workplace smoking policies and smoking rules in the home</p></li>\n<li><p>Attitudes toward smoking in public places</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another generally unique feature to the 2003 TUS-CPS was the administration of questions to former smokers on their previous level of addiction, products/resources/methods used to quit smoking, and advice from health professionals. This feature enables comparisons between characteristics of former smokers (or successful quitters) and current smokers attempting to quit.</p>\n<p>Administrative information was collected on who the proxy respondents were, the language in which the interview was conducted, and the survey method (telephone vs. personal-visit interviews; Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) vs. Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI)). Demographic information collected include age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, veteran status, educational attainment, family relationship, occupation, and income.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"addiction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census
