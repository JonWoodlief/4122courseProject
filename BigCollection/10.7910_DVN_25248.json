From 28 May to 25 June 2010, 1,526 cerambycids representing 71 species were captured in pheromone-baited traps, with 14 species accounting for 92% of the specimens. Test compounds with a 3-hydroxyalkan-2-one or 2,3-alkanediol motif attracted significant numbers of both sexes for eight species in the subfamily Cerambycinae, including species of Demonax, Rhaphuma, and Xylotrechus. Rhaphuma horsfieldi (White) was the only species that was strongly attracted to more than one test compound, with significant attraction to both (2R*,3R*)- 2,3-hexanediol and (2R*,3R*)-2,3-octanediol. Within the Lamiinae, males and females of  species were significantly attracted to 2-(undecyloxy)ethanol, including Acalolepta formosana (Breuning), Monochamus bimaculatus Gahan, Pharsalia subgemmata (Thomson), Pseudomacrochenus antennatus (Gahan), and Xenohammus bimaculatus Schwarzer. Only male Megopis costipennis White (Prioninae) were significantly attracted to (2R*,3S*)-2,3-octanediol, suggesting that this compound may be a sex pheromone component for this species. To date, 2,3-octanediols have only been reported as aggregatio\nn pheromone components for cerambycids in the subfamily Cerambycinae. Our results support the hypothesis that both closely related (congeners) and more distantly related cerambycid species (different tribes and even subfamilies) may share pheromone components. Our results also demonstrate that traps baited with even a limited number of different classes of pheromones may be useful tools for surveying cerambycid diversity, as well as for detecting and monitoring particular species, especially those that have the potential to be invasive pests in other parts of the world."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-03-28"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ecology"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Rain forest"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"JACOB D.
