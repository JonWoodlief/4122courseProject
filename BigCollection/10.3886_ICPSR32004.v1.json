The evaluation team asked the Rhode Island Department of Corrections champion, a probation supervisor, for suggestions, and the probation administrators agreed to send out an encouraging e-mail to all officers to explain that Urban Institute is a legitimate institution and to reiterate why the survey would be beneficial. The Urban Institute sent weekly reminder messages over a three-month period (ending January 2010), and potential respondents were also offered the option of faxing or e-mailing their completed surveys to the research team.
