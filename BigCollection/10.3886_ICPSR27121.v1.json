All NSAL adult respondents had an opportunity to complete a supplemental self-administered mail survey (NSAL SAQ) following their NSAL interview. The SAQ 40-page questionnaire contains key questions initially included in the NSAL that were removed from the initial interview in order to reduce respondent burden. The respondent was asked if they wanted to participate in a mailback survey. If they agreed, the questionnaire was sent by mail and once received, an\nincentive payment was sent. The overall response rate was 56.5 percent (n = 3,438); the response rate was 59.9 percent for African Americans (n = 2,137), 42.9 percent for Caribbean Blacks (n = 695), and 68.0 percent for Whites (n = 606). Overall, the demographic distributions of re-interview respondents did not differ greatly from those of the main NSAL sample. The largest differences were among response rates for the different race groups. Being female, being unemployed, having higher levels of education, and participating in the original NSAL interview post-September 11, 2001, were also associated with higher response rates on the mailback survey relative to other NSAL respondents.

These weights were created by multiplying the original NSAL weights by an additional factor adjusting for nonresponse in the self-administered mail questionnaire. A logistic regression to predict likelihood of mail survey response was conducted using all 6,082 NSAL respondents. Predictors in the final model included race; sex; education; work status; age; home ownership; foreign-born versus US-born; whether the respondents' main NSAL interview took place after September 11, 2001; participation in the NSAL Clinical Reappraisal interview; count of chronic health conditions; length of main NSAL interview; respondent prayer and religiosity; respondents' assessment of his/her weight; financial hardship, respondents' birth order; welfare receipt; respondent impatience during the main NSAL interview; and respondent suspicion about main NSAL interview. Several interactions were also included in the model. Predicted probabilities of responding to the mail survey were calculated and, for respondents, the inverse of this probability was multiplied by the original NSAL weight, and then divided by the mean of these new weights. All mail survey nonrespondents received a weight of zero on the mail survey weights. Mail survey weights should be used for all analyses where any variables from the mail survey are included, regardless of their status as independent variables or dependent variables."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Of the 6,082 NSAL respondents, 3,438 completed the RIW.
