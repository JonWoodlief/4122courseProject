The overall research design for the study was based on the\nSURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES, 1983 (ICPSR 9751), which assessed the financial status of American households using a \"balance-sheet\" approach. This approach permits a systematic investigation of the various types of assets and liabilities held by households, with each component monetized at its current market value. Detailed information was collected on household savings and wealth, including the amount and types of financial and nonfinancial investments and liabilities, as well as entitlements to private and public pension benefits. Pension plan providers were identified and then contacted for information about their plans. Pension plan variables include actual service years, potential service years, final average pay, Social Security offset, mandatory contributions by participants, employer matching of mandatory contributions, potential voluntary contributions by participants, employer matching of voluntary contributions, employer contributions to pension plan, employer contributions to participants, and lump-sum contributions at retirement. Pension eligibility requirement variables include required age and service, other requirements, date restrictions, when payments begin, and length of payment period. Household and individual variables cover date of birth, date hired, age hired, date terminated employment, age terminated employment, date retirement benefits begin, age retirement benefits begin, date at death, age at death, probability of retirement circumstance, participant's special qualifications, hours worked per year, rate of pay per year, and participant's voluntary contributions."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employee benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial assets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household income"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"investments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension contributions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
