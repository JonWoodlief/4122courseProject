In view of this, value chain development (VCD) of these products and its importance for rural development is increasingly becoming an important topic for discussion. In Cameroon, development and research organizations have promoted the commercialization of Ricinodendron heudelotii (Baill.) Pierre ex Pax., locally known as Njansang which is under-utilized species found in West and Central Africa. The aim of these initiatives is to alleviate poverty through activities like traini\nng on production, processing and collective marketing. After 10 years, it is imperative to know how collective action interventions have influenced the development of the value chain. This study therefore assesses the effects of collective action on producersâ livelihoods and the business performance of traders involved in the njansang value chain. The â5 capitalsâ framework, which is a tool for assessing the poverty impacts of value chain interventions, was employed.  Sixteen focus group discussions were held with producers and traders involved in the njansang value chain in the West, Centre and East regions of Cameroon. A survey using structured questionnaires was also administered with 169 producers and 15 traders on their perception of the impacts of collective action interventions. The results indicate that farmers have benefitted from collective action through improved processing techniques, increased income resulting from economies of scale, as well as social benefits. Traders have gained through bulk buying from producers, reducing their transaction costs and improved consistency in supply. It is concluded that, among others, collective action can be an important entry point for the promotion of under-utilized species. However, it needs to be complemented with other interventions such as financial support which can help farmers to reduce side selling outside the group."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014-03-31"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"farmer groups"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"livelihood improvement"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"njansang"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Godwill Nimino, Amos Gyau, Ann Degrande, Steve Franzel, and Jason Donovan 2014.
