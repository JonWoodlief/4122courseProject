To date, more than 24 major BPH-resistance genes have been reported in several Oryza sativa ssp. indica cultivars and wild relatives. Here, we report the genetic basis of the high level of BPH resistance derived from an Indian rice cultivar, ADR52, which was previously identified as resistant to the whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera [Horvath]). An F2 population derived from a cross between ADR52 and a susceptible cultivar, Taichung 65 (T65), was used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Antibiosis testing showed that multiple loci controlled the high level of BPH resistance in this F2 population. Further linkage analysis using backcross populations resulted in the identification of BPH-resistance (antibiosis) gene loci from ADR52. BPH25 co-segregated with marker S00310 on the distal end of the short arm of  chromosome 6, and BPH26 co-segregated with marker RM5479 on the long arm of chromosome 12. To characterize the virulence of the most recently migratedBPH strain in Japan, preliminary near-isogenic lines (pre-NILs) and a preliminary pyramided line (pre-PYL) carrying BPH25 and BPH26 were evaluated. Although both pre-NILs were susceptible to the virulent BPH strain, the pre-PYL exhibited a high level of resistance. The pyramiding of resistance genes is therefore likely to be effective for increasing the durability of resistance against the new virulent BPH strain in Japan."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Other"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rice"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"planthopper"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: null  Type: PBGB  Notes: ;"},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science"},"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (2058007)"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Genomics for Agricultural innovation, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery of Japan"},"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"QTL-2001 to H.Y"}},{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Integrated Research Project for Plants, Insects, and Animals using Genome Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery of Japan"},"grantNumberValue":{"typeName":"grantNumberValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"QT-4008 and QT-4010"}}]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Theoretical and Applied Genetics"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"SpringerLink"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Theor Appl Gen"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://link.springer.com/journal/124"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://link.springer.com/static-content/covers/journals_single_issue/473/00122_126_012.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jean Sabado"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2013-12-01"},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Khush GS (1979) Genetics of and breeding for the resistance to the brown planthopper.
