The researchers used a classic longitudinal design,  replicated over two cohorts (those born in 1972 and 1973), each  assessed first when 18 years old, and again when 19, 20, 21, and 22  years old. The first survey (Part 1, Female Data) collected  information on the respondent's experiences of sexual assault from age  14 to the present (age 18). Other questions focused on the kind of  person the respondent thought she was, how much of an influence  religion had on the way she chose to spend each day, her dating  behavior during high school, the number of times the respondent had  used behavior such as discussing issues relatively calmly, arguing,  sulking, stomping out of the room, or threatening to hit, with a  romantic partner during high school, and how frequently romantic  partners used these types of behavior with the respondent. Other items  elicited information on the number of women the respondent knew who  had been sexually victimized, whether men forced them to engage in  sexual activities, the nature of the respondent's sexual experience  from the time she was 14 to the present, the respondent's age when  each experience occurred, if the respondent or the other person was  using drugs or alcohol when it happened, if the respondent was  injured, and whom the respondent told about the  experience. Information was collected on sexual abuse prior to the age  of 14 as well. The respondent was also asked to describe how often her  parents or stepparents had administered physical blows (i.e., hitting,  kicking, throwing someone down), whether someone had fondled her in a  sexual way, whether a male had attempted intercourse with the  respondent, the relationship between the respondent and the  perpetrator, the respondent's age when the experience occurred, who  the other person was, who initiated the date or paid for the food,  drinks, or ticke\nts, whether the respondent or the other person was  using drugs or alcohol, the respondent's opinions about men and women  in America (i.e., if the respondent agreed or disagreed that  chivalrous gestures toward women on the part of men should be  encouraged), whether the respondent had engaged in sexual intercourse  when she did not want to because a male threatened or used some degree  of physical force (twisting her arm, holding her down, etc.), and the  respondent's drug and alcohol use. The subsequent surveys contained  measures of sexual assault during each year of college (i.e., since  the previous survey). Questions asked in subsequent surveys were  similar to those in the first survey, and the responses are all  included in Part 1. Questions posed to males (Part 2, Male Data)  included the number of women the respondent had sexual intercourse  with, how often the respondent heard talk that speculated how a  particular woman would be in bed, reasons the respondent engaged in  sexual activity, number of times the respondent engaged in sexual  intercourse when a woman didn't want to, and questions similar to  those in Part 1 with the respondent as the perpetrator.

The research goals of the study  focused on physical violence among acquaintances, paralleling the work  that had already been done on experiences with sexual coercion. The  researchers were also interested in the co-occurrence of sexual and  physical assault. The study fills a gap in the knowledge about  violence against women by addressing the relationship between  experiences of sexual and physical violence from the perspectives of  victim and perpetrator. Specific goals were: (1) to explore whether  and how the characteristics of the agent (perpetrator), the host  (victim), and the environment (situational/contextual effects)  individually and in combination affect the risk of physical  victimization or its perpetration during the developmental stages of  adolescence and young adulthood, and (2) to examine how the three  types of factors evolve from one developmental stage to the next to  predict (a) the onset of victimization or perpetration or (b) the occurrence of revictimization or reperpetration."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were analyzed from a National Institute of  Health-funded five-year longitudinal study (1990-1995) of  victimization and perpetration among college students demographically  representative of undergraduate women and men in state-supported  universities in the United States. The researchers used a classic  longitudinal design, replicated over two cohorts (those born in 1972  and 1973), each assessed first when 18 years old, and again when 19,  20, 21, and 22 years old. The researchers worked with the university  administration to gain permission to survey students in groups during  the first day of student orientation, and trained student orientation  leaders to administer the survey, thus making participation in the  study an integral part of the student orientation activities. Students  who did not attend orientation, which was not required, were contacted  by phone. Before the initial survey was administered, its purpose and  methods were explained and signed consent was obtained. Students also  completed contact sheets for the purpose of follow-up. To ensure  confidentiality and still permit the matching of surveys across time,  each survey and corresponding contact sheet was assigned a randomly  determined c\node number. Only code numbers appeared on surveys and  answer sheets. Lists of codes and corresponding names were kept in a  locked safe to protect the identity of participants, and access was  limited to the co-investigators and the data manager. To further  ensure confidentiality of the data, and to bolster students'  confidence in their commitment to protecting confidentiality, the  researchers obtained a federal Certificate of Confidentiality. Toward  the end of each spring semester, students were contacted and asked to  complete a follow-up survey during one of several sessions held at  various locations around campus. Postcards were sent to remind  students of the follow-up survey and to announce times and locations  for the sessions. These sessions were conducted by trained  undergraduate psychology majors and graduate students. Students who  did not attend one of these sessions were contacted by telephone and  invited to participate. They were given the option of attending a  session being held on campus, or of receiving the survey via  mail. This was particularly useful for students who had withdrawn from  the university or who were residing out of town. All students who  participated in the follow-ups received $15 each time they  participated. Students who had withdrawn from the university were also resurveyed."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The first survey (Part 1, Female Data) collected  information on the respondent's experiences of sexual assault from age  14 to the present (age 18).
