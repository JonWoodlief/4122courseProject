A further objective was to compare the  relative effectiveness of strategies drawn from professional- versus  community-oriented models of policing. The professional model  emphasizes police responsibility for crime control, whereas the  community model stresses the importance of a police-citizen  partnership in crime control. At each site, experimental treatments  were applied to selected police beats. The Oakland Police Department  implemented a high-visibility enforcement effort consisting of  undercover buy-bust operations, aggressive patrols, and motor vehicle  stops, while the Birmingham Police Department engaged in somewhat less  visible buy-busts and sting operations. Both departments attempted a  community-oriented approach involving door-to-door contacts with  residents. In Oakland, four beats were studied: one beat used a  special drug enforcement unit, another used a door-to-door community  policing strategy, a third used a combination of these approaches, and  the fourth beat served as a control group. In Birmingham, three beats  were chosen: Drug enforcement was conducted by the narcotics unit in  one beat, door-to-door policing, as in Oakland, was used in another  beat, and a police substation was established in the third beat. To  evaluate the effectiveness of these alternative strategies, data were  collected from three sources. First, a panel survey was administered  in two waves on a pre-test/post-test basis. The panel survey data  addressed the ways in which citizens' perceptions of drug activity,  crime problems, neighborhood safety, and police service were affected  by the various policing strategies. Second, structured observations of  police and citizen encounters were made in Oakland during the periods  the treatments were in effect. Observers trained by the researchers  recorded information regarding the roles and behaviors of police and  citizens as well as police compliance with the experiment's  procedures. And third, to assess the impact of the alternative  strategies on crime rates, reported crime data were collected for time  periods before and during the experimental treatment periods, both in the targeted beats and city-wide."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The researchers conducted this study to provide  evidence of the effectiveness of alternative drug enforcement  strategies.

In each city, the main focus was on evaluating the  impact of alternative policing methods on citizens' attitudes and  reported crime. The researchers selected beats to either receive an  experimental treatment or to act as a control group. The treatments  consisted of either increasing enforcement activities based on the  professional policing model, or increasing police-citizen cooperation  based on the community policing model. In Oakland, the enforcement  activities were conducted by Special Duty Unit 3 (SDU-3) and consisted  of undercover buy-bust operations, aggressive patrols, and motor  vehicle stops. The community policing activity consisted of  door-to-door contacts with citizens. The Oakland data contain  information on four beats: one control and three treatments. For the  period May-October 1988, SDU-3 operated in Beat 25, community policing  was practiced in Beat 7, both SDU-3 and community policing were in  effect in Beat 34, and Beat 11 served as the control group, with no  change in police activities. One rotation of treatments occurred among  the beats during the period November 1988-April 1989. During that  time, SDU-3 operated in Beat 34, community policing was practiced in  Beat 11, both treatments were in effect in Beat 7, and Beat 25 served  as the control group. In Birmingham, the enforcement activities  included less visible buy-busts and sting operations conducted by the  narcotics unit. The community policing efforts involved door-to-door  contacts, as in Oakland, and the establishment of a police substation.  In contrast to the Oakland site, a control group did not exist in  Birmingham. Three beats received three different treatments: Beat 61  used narcotics unit enforcement, Beat 84 practiced door-to-door  policing, and Beat 62 had a police substation. No rotation of  treatments occurred. These treatments were in effect from September  1988 to February 1989. Structured observations of the police were performed in Oakland."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Each data source focused on collecting specific  types of information. Panel surveys in both Oakland and Birmingham  asked questions on topics such as awareness of drug trafficking  problems, prevalence of crime other than drug trafficking, awareness  of specific police programs aimed at controlling crime and drugs,  perceived safety of the neighborhood, quality of life in the  neighborhood, and satisfaction with police service. The structured  observations in Oakland assessed the major roles, behavior, and  decisions of police and citizens in drug-related encounters.  Observational data were recorded using two different instruments: a  \"long form\" used in 353 encounters in which an arrest was made, and a  \"short form\" used in 130 encounters in which police briefly stopped  and questioned individuals but did not make an arrest. (Structured  observations were not conducted in Birmingham.) Drug arrest data were  gathered for both cities. Location of arrest, crime type, suspect  information, and evidence were of particular interest. Additional  crime data were collected covering offenses against persons (homicide, rape, and felonious assault), burglaries, and robberies."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community involvement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community policing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime control"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug law offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug related crimes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug traffic"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhoods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
