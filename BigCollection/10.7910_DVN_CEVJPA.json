The study explored how the experiences of the participants affected their attitudes about themselves and their career and family formation plans. <br /><br /> The sample consisted of 801 male and female undergraduate students, 477 freshmen and 324 seniors. The participants attended a competitive, private university in the northeastern United States. The sample was predominantly White and from middle- to upper- socioeconomic backgrounds.\r\n<br /><br /> Data collection occurred between February and May of 2000. The students were mailed a self-administered questionnaire to complete and return. The students were informed that upon receipt of the completed questionnaire, they would be entered in a lottery drawing for a chance to win a gift certificate. The initial mailing was followed by postcard and telephone call reminders. <br /><br /> Topics addressed include academic interests, career aspirations, parents' work history, perceived roles of men and women in society, self-esteem, attitudes, future academic, occupational and marital plans, and concerns about future Career-Marriage Conflict (CMC). Measures include items from the Trait Anxiety Scale (TAS; Spielberg, 1983), the Self-Rating Inventory (Zuckerman, 1982), the Attitudes towards Women Scale (AWS; Spence, Helmreich and Stapp, 1973) and the Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1967).\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study.
