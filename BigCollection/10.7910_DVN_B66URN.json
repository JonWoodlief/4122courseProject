We present a method for analyzing the validity of theoretical/historical accounts that unifies theory, history and measurement. We argue that approaches to testing accounts of legislative behavior which are theoretically and historically agnostic are not alwa\nys best and present an approach which: 1) forms an \\textit{explicit} explanation of behavior (here a simple dynamic voting game) that yields estimable parameter constraints, and 2) tests these constraints using a customized empirical model that is as consistent as possible with the explanation. We demonstrate the method using legislative voting data from the first Congress (1789-1791). Using the idea of sophisticated equivalents from voting theory we subject the traditional account of the \"Compromise of 1790\" to a statistical test and find that there is reason to doubt the claim that legislators of the time believed the specified log roll was taking place. The results suggest that the capital location and assumption issues were resolved independently"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Joshua Clinton and Adam Meirowitz. 2004. \"Testing Accounts of Legislative Strategic Voting: The Compromise of 1790,\" American Journal of Political Science 48(4):675-89. <a href= \"http://www.princeton.edu/~clinton/Published/CM_AJPS2004.pdf\" target= \"_new\">article available here</a>"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: This study was deposited under the of the Data-PASS standard deposit terms.
