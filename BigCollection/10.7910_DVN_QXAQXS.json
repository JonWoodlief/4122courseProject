The standard recode file was created from the edited questionnaire and country recode file in 1979. In this process some inconsistencies found in the data were corrected (see Abdel-Aziz, 1983). The study has 3610 valid cases.   The survey was conducted by Mr. Abu Nuwar for the Government of Jordan for the World Fertility Survey programme (see Akin et al., 1986) between July and September 1976. JFS individual interviewees were selected from 1 in 4 of 14068 households in Jordan's East Bank that participated in a household- level survey. 14068 households represent about 5% of Jordan's East Bank population. (see Abdel-Aziz, 1983). Questions include breast-feeding patterns for the last two children, contraceptive usage (e.g. pill, IUD, sterilization, condom, douche, rhythm, withdrawal, abstinence), duration and number of marriages, pregnancy and abortion, desire for future children, wanted vs unwanted pregnancy, child gender preference.  The demographics include age, marital status, number of marriages, age at first marriage, religion, urban vs rural vs migration residence, educational, and work status of parents before and after marriage, and number of children in groups of 0-3, 4-6, 7-12 and over 13.   Notes. (see Abdel-Aziz, 1983 for detailed analysis of errors and omissions in the study based on comparison of the study to 1961 and 1972 census data):  JFS study more complete than eit\nher census. 1072 women knew the month and year of their birth, 572 knew their birthday year only. The remaining interviewees estimated their age. The date on which the first marriage began is considered the date of the beginning of cohabitation, which for cultural reasons may be years after the official ceremony.  There is a potential under-reporting of divorce in JFS.  Older women may be under-reporting births or time of early births (Nur, 1984).  \" about 90 percent of the contacted women were successfully interviewed.\" (see Edmonston, Barry, 1983) Infant mortality may be underreported (See  Abdel-Aziz, 1983, Nu, 1985)."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2014"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"birth rate"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family planning"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"breast-feeding"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"contraception"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"maternal age"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"woman"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"female"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"number of children"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jordan"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Health Statistics - International"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Middle East - Jordan"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"World Fertility Survey"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Population Research - Fertility"}},{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Demography"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Version Date: 1979-08-22Version Text: 2.1 Subject: STANDARD DEPOSIT TERMS 1.0  Type: DATAPASS:TERMS:STANDARD:1.0  Notes: of the Archive), within the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (\"Data-PASS\") in accordance with the Data-PASS terms (the \"Terms\") of use (available from: http://www.icpsr.org/Data-PASS).
