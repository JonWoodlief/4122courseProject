In an  attempt to inform and advance the literature on co-offending, this  study tracked through time the patterns of criminal behavior among a  sample of offenders and their accomplices.

Relying on the 1987  crime as a point of reference, all crimes committed by offenders  between January 1976 and December 1994 were reviewed to assure  complete coverage of juvenile records. In addition, accomplices were  traced for the 353 randomly selected offenders who had committed at  least one co-offense. The principal investigator planned to use  police tapes to match offenders to offenses, but the tapes were  missing too much data. Instead, data were collected from court  folders, which contained witness, complainant, police, and co-offender  reports.
