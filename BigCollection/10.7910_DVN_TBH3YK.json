Often these compromises are treated as separate events, the result of deliberation leading to moderation of delegate positions (presumably among the key states of Massachusetts and North Carolina). However, by applying the techniques of roll call analysis we ﬁnd this traditional account is at best incomplete and probably misleading. While the Massachusetts delegation’s behavior seems consistent with a moderation hypothesis, we ﬁnd evidence that the other crucial vote for the Great Compromise — from North Carolina—is inconsistent with moderation, but can be linked through the agenda to the Three-ﬁfths Compromise over slavery, taxation and representation. We conclude by arguing that this reconsideration of some of the convention’s key votes should cause political scientists and historians to reevaluate how they see the compromises at the convention."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Jeremy C.
