The primary investigators attempted to empirically measure the concept of westernization. These data offer temporal and international coverage, a theory-driven classification of globalization indicators, and standardizations of these indicators. Using large samples of the world's countries for mid-decade years in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, these data amass three interrelated dimensions and their corresponding measures of westernization, i.e., economic, cultural, and political. Measures of political westernization include each nation's participation in western international treaties and western international non-governmental organizations as well as the total amount of United States military aid received and the total number of western embassies present. The economic measures examined include each nation's inflow of United States direct investment, United States economic aid, and Official Development Assistance from Western Nations as well as a nation's total trade with Western nations and total number of patents filed in the United States. The cultural measures compiled include each nation's total number of Western foreign press bureaus present, tourists from Western nations, tertiary-level students attending Western institutions, and phone calls to and from the United States. Descriptive characteristics collected include each country's United Nations Country Code, total population, and gross domestic product (GDP). Part 1 of this collection consists of a large sample of the world's nation-states. Part 2 is a subset of Part 1, which contains only those countries in the sample that had populations of at least one million people in 1995."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cultural influences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic expansion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"globalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international markets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international trade"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XI.C.
