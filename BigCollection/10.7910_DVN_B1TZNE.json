Drawing on over forty years of bill sponsorship data from the U.S. House of Representatives, we define women’s issues in terms of those sponsored at a greater rate by women in Congress.  Our analysis reveals that most (but not all) of the classically considered women’s issues are indeed raised at an enhanced rate by congresswomen.  We then track the fate of those issues.  While 4% of all bills become law, that rate drops to 2% for women’s issues and to only 1% for women’s issue bills sponsored by women themselves.  This pattern persists over time – from the early 1970s through today – and upon controlling for other factors that influence bills success rates.  We link the bias against women’s issues to the committee process, and suggest several avenues for further research."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-05-16"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"U.S. Congress"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gender"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"women's issues"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legislative effectiveness"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The files include the data to replicate all figures and tables in the paper, a stata .do file to undertake those replications, and an excel file that provides the data and calculations for Table 1 in the paper"},{"typeName":"producer","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"producerName":{"typeName":"producerName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Wiseman, Alan E."},"producerAffiliation":{"typeName":"producerAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Vanderbilt University"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"wiseman, alan"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-05-16"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This is an excel spreadsheet that provides the data that is used to create Figure 1 in the published paper, \"Women's Issues and Their Fates in the United States Congress\" (with the figure embedded into the spreadsheet)","label":"PSRM_figure_1_VWW_data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":84174,"dataFile":{"id":2839325,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/B1TZNE/Z2ODIC","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/B1TZNE/Z2ODIC","filename":"PSRM_figure_1_VWW_data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":416,"description":"This is an excel spreadsheet that provides the data that is used to create Figure 1 in the published paper, \"Women's Issues and Their Fates in the United States Congress\" (with the figure embedded into the spreadsheet)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1551bc2ecb6-d5f6d29d7be2","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:vMUn3jgecpxpjo6N+LhfDQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"fef78419b7b40705a0297960647943d6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"fef78419b7b40705a0297960647943d6"}}},{"description":"This is an excel spreadsheet that provides the data that is used to create Figure 3 in the published paper, \"Women's Issues and Their Fates in the United States Congress\" (with the figure embedded into the spreadsheet)","label":"PSRM_figure_3_VWW_data.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":84174,"dataFile":{"id":2839324,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/B1TZNE/HVGZL3","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/B1TZNE/HVGZL3","filename":"PSRM_figure_3_VWW_data.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":455,"description":"This is an excel spreadsheet that provides the data that is used to create Figure 3 in the published paper, \"Women's Issues and Their Fates in the United States Congress\" (with the figure embedded into the spreadsheet)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1551bc2e044-665d575f65a5","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:uv5nO0+falGRFQyOMA2Kuw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"af479ad0939eb599bbe08720d4d0012c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"af479ad0939eb599bbe08720d4d0012c"}}},{"description":"Stata Dataset to replicate analysis in tables and figures in paper","label":"VWW_PSRM_2016_Replication_Dataset_Stata11.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":84174,"dataFile":{"id":2829032,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/B1TZNE/HXHDHC","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/B1TZNE/HXHDHC","filename":"VWW_PSRM_2016_Replication_Dataset_Stata11.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":26316783,"description":"Stata Dataset to replicate analysis in tables and figures in paper","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:154b9dd92aa-7ffdfb8f0790","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:NDZMBLLWKbigfyiObXLNLw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"53c9fd269125c86d8c2bd4cd7a2efd50","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"53c9fd269125c86d8c2bd4cd7a2efd50"}}},{"description":"This is the Stata .do file that uses data written in VWW_PSRM_2016_Replication_Dataset_Stata11.tab to replicate analysis and calculations that are presented in Tables and Figures in paper;
