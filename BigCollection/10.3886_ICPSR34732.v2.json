The special topic modules address such topics as agriculture, education, natural environment and resources, public health, public safety and crime, and science and technology.</p>\n\n<p>This round of Eurobarometer surveys covers the standard modules and the following special topics: (1) The Future of Europe, (2) Awareness of Home Affairs, and (3) E-Communications in the Household. Questions pertain to opinions about EU objectives and policy towards social and economic policy and respondents' awareness of social, economic, and political issues in the EU and its member countries.
