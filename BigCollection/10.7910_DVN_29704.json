The present study was carried out in the experimental plots of ICRAF at Mbalmayo. From the data collected, the results have shown that the average biomass, carbon stock and CO2 sequestered are higher in cutting's plots (268.1 ÃÂ± 191.3) compared to the populations of marcots (217.4 ÃÂ± 127.9) and of seedlings (131.0 ÃÂ± 93.63). No significant difference was observed between CO2 sequestered in the population of cuttings and marcots (F2; 85 = 5.256; ÃÂ = 0.569 > 5%). An evaluation of the potential incomes that could be generated from the different types of propagules gave 129,595 Fcfa/ha, 105,085 Fcfa/ha and finally 63,320 Fcfa/ha for the  population of cuttings, marcots and seedlings respectively. Theimplication for theopportunities related to the PES via the CDM increase with the capacity of CO2 sequestration indicates that the populations of trees from cuttings will offer more incomesin the case of carbon marketthan those from other propagules."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Atiojio, E.N.
