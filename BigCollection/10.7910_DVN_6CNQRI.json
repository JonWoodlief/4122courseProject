The study involved both the secondary analysis of data collected by Hoffman in 1974, and the collection of follow-up data in 1980 from Hoffman's participants. Hoffman's 1974 study was a follow-up of Horner's 1965 fear of success sample.\n<br /><br />  Of the 86 women who had participated in Hoffman's 1974 study, 58 participated in this follow-up study. The average age of the 1980 respondents was 33.5 years, and all but one were college graduates. Forty-five were married, and 44 were working.<br /><br />  Data collection was carried out by means of a 28-page mailed questionnaire. Variables assessed included number of children, reasons for having children and/or plans to have children in the future, satisfaction with timing of par\nenthood, actual or anticipated changes due to parenthood, marital status and marital satisfaction, work history, current work status, career plans, income and spouse's income, and report of changes in personal goals since 1974.\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds all .\r \r The Murray Archive holds additional analogue materials for this study: Original record paper data; data from all three datasets (Horner, 1965, Log# 00075; Hoffman, 1974, Log# 00014; and Foltz, 1980, Log# 00615) which yields three waves of data collection.
