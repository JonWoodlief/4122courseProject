Cohort 18 could not be used, because the My ETV scale was not collected at wave 2 for cohort 18. For LCS, a random sample of 6,226 children and youth within 6 months of ages 0 (in utero), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years were selected from a random sample of 80 neighborhood clusters (NCs) at baseline using a multistage probability design. About 25 youth per NC were interviewed 3 times. The neighborhood-level data was aggregated from the wave 1 community survey which assessed residents' perceptions of their neighborhood quality, safety and sense of community. Approximately, 8,872 residents ages 18 years and older were randomly selected to be surveyed from 343 total Chicago NCs.

Values were imputed only if one wave was missing data. If more than one wave was missing data, then no imputation was done.

Thus, the final sample included 1,114 youth in 78 neighborhoods for analysis.
