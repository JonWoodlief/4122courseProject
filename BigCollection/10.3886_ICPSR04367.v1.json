Instead of focusing on women as potential victims and men as potential perpetrators, the program was different from other prevention programs in that it approached both women and men as potential bystanders or witnesses to behaviors related to sexual violence. Three hundred and eighty-nine undergraduate students were recruited to participant in the study in the spring (first wave) and fall (second wave) semesters of 2003 at a northeastern state university in the United States. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control group. All first-wave participants filled out pretest questionnaires (Part 1), post-test questionnaires (Part 2), and questionnaires two (Part 3) and twelve (Part 4) months following the first post test. Those in the first wave experimental conditions participated in the one-session or three-session training program prior to filling out the post-test questionnaire, and they participated in a booster session before filling out the questionnaire at the two-month mark. Second-wave participants experienced similar treatments through the two-month follow-up questionnaire. After that, they received a four-month follow-up questionnaire (Part 5) at the same time that the first-wave participants did their twelve-month follow-up questionnaire.

The  prevention program used a community of responsibility model to teach  women and men how to intervene safely and effectively in cases of  sexual violence before, during, and after incidents with strangers,  acquaintances, or friends. The program varied from other prevention  programs in that it approached both women and men as potential  bystanders or witnesses to behaviors related to sexual violence. The  program incorporated predictors of successful bystander intervention  that could be reinforced by education: recognizing inappropriate  behavior, skill building, requesting a commitment to intervene, and role modeling."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The effectiveness of the rape prevention program  was evaluated by determining if participants in either a one- or  three-session version of the program (treatment condition) showed  improvement across measures of attitudes, knowledge, and behavior  concerning sexual violence, which the control group did not. The  recruitment of study participants was accomplished with the use of  flyers and face-to-face recruitment. For the first wave only, the  flyers were used. Over 500 brightly colored flyers were displayed  around campus and the nearby downtown area to attract prospective  participants. In order to solicit a broader audience than might sign  up for a study relating to sexual violence, the flyers called for  undergraduate students to participate in a study about community and  relationship problems, included tear-off tabs with telephone number  and email address for contacting the researchers, and advertised the  potential to earn money by participating in the study. The second wave  recruitment effort included the\nflyers, but also included face-to-face  recruitment at the student union building. The first wave of the study  was conducted during the spring semester of 2003 and the second wave  of the study was conducted the following semester, in fall 2003. Three  hundred and eighty-nine undergraduates participated and were randomly  assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control group. All  first-wave participants filled out pretest questionnaires (Part 1),  post-test questionnaires (Part 2), and questionnaires two (Part 3) and  twelve (Part 4) months following the first post test. Those in the  experimental conditions participated in the one-session or  three-session program prior to filling out the post-test  questionnaire, and they participated in a booster session before  filling out the questionnaire at the two-month mark. The first session  of the three-session treatment program presented the context of sense  of community and community responsibility. Study participants were  introduced to the notion of bystander responsibility, examined issues  related to community membership, were asked to draw examples from  their own experience of times when they had witnessed an intervention  or intervened to help someone, and gained an understanding of  individual and situation factors that enhance appropriate bystander  intervention. The second session of the program was designed to  increase awareness of sexual violence and to give study participants  an opportunity to apply bystander responsibility to sexual  violence. Finally, the third session allowed study participants to  develop skills as bystanders. The session was designed to increase  awareness among participants of the range of potential bystander  behaviors with regard to personal safety, to make resources available  to aid them during intervention, and to help them to understand the  decision-making process behind successful bystander invention. The  one-session treatment program was designed to cover the same topics as  the three-session treatment program, though with less time given to go  over each new idea and fewer examples used. The booster session, given  two months after the completion of the first post-test, was designed  as an informal discussion of what the study participants remembered  from the prevention program. Second-wave participants experienced  similar treatments through the administration of the two-month  follow-up questionnaire. After that they received a four-month  follow-up questionnaire (Part 5) at the same time the first-wave  participants did their twelve-month follow-up questionnaire. Study  participants were paid for their time. Those who participated in the  three-session program received $80.00, the one-session participants  earned $40.00, and those in the control group were paid $25.00 for the  initial phase of the research. After the post-test session, all study  participants were paid $15.00 for each additional questionnaire they  filled out and returned. A $75.00 lottery was held as an additional  incentive for all students who participated in all possible phases of the research."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1, Pretest Data, contains variables including  the group (experimental or control), if the respondent had ever  attended sexual harassment or sexual violence programs, and if any  course the respondent had taken had discussed the topic of sexual  assault.
