The survey questions focused on the  legal framework and organizational structure in which local  prosecutors operate. Variables in Section 1, Background Information o\nn  the Jurisdiction, include the capacity in which the jurisdiction is  involved in homeland security issues, the number of terrorism-related  offenses and terrorist acts investigated and/or prosecuted, and  whether the offense was classified as domestic and/or international.  Experience With State Legislation (Section 2) variables include the  awareness of new state statutes, the number of cases investigated  and/or prosecuted under new and/or amended statutes, the prosecution  of precursor crimes related to terrorism -- and how such crimes are  determined to be related to terrorism, as well as caseload changes by  crime. Items contained in Section 3, Organizational Changes, include  the procedural/organizational changes in the office in response to the  September 11 attacks, the number and type of staff involved in  terrorism-related cases, case processing issues, and other changes in  policy/procedures. Section 4, Challenges Facing Local Prosecutors,  contains questions pertaining to the perceived challenges and value of  new intelligence-gathering methods and the perceived impact of the new  legislation on ability to respond to terrorism. Section 5, Methods  Used to Overcome Challenges, asks respondents about 16 methods that  jurisdictions employ to overcome the challenges encountered as a  result of investigating and prosecuting terrorism incidents. Variables  pertaining to the types and frequency of information sharing with  other local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies,  participation in anti-terrorism task forces, and intelligence sharing  are included in Section 6, Coordination With Other Agencies.
