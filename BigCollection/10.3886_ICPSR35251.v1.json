These surveys regularly monitor public opinion in the European Union (EU) member countries and consist of standard modules and special topic modules. The standard modules address attitudes towards European unification, institutions and policies, measurements for general socio-political orientations, as well as respondent and household demographics. The special topic modules address such topics as agriculture, education, natural environment and resources, public health, public safety and crime, and science and technology.</p>\n\n<p>This round of Eurobarometer surveys covers the following special topics: (1) Future of Europe, and (2) Consumer behavior in the European Union. In regard to the future of Europe, opinions were collected on the expected quality of life for future generations, main challenges for the EU to face in the future, predictions on whether EU society will place more importance on solidarity or individualism and predictions of whether the EU will be a leading diplomatic power. In regard to consumer behavior, respondents were asked if they had a legitimate cause for complaint during a transaction, what type of action was taken during the interaction, court ruling where a business was taken to court, willingness to go to court, reasons to go to court in another EU member state, and European small claims procedure. Additional information includes respondents' sources of political knowledge and to what extent they feel well informed on political matters.</p>\n\n<p>Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or a mobile telephone and other durable goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.
