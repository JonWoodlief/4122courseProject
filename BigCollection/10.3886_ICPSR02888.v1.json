The study focuses on  answering three research questions: (1) Who were the program  participants? (2) What were the characteristics of the program? (3)  Was the program reaching the most appropriate offenders, or were its  participants primarily offenders who were not likely to become  recidivists? The study contains information on every inmate who  entered the Genesis program from July 31, 1997, to July 31, 1998. For  evaluation purposes, the researchers designed their own data  collection form which they used to collect relevant information from  each participant's treatment program file. Each participant's file was  maintained by Genesis program staff and was kept for the duration each  inmate was in the program. From each program participant at intake,  using the data collection instrument, the researchers collected  demographic information, substance abuse history, and criminal  history. The data are provided in two parts. Both parts are from the  same data collection instrument. Part 1 covers Questions 1 through 15  of the data collection instrument, while Part 2 covers Questions 16  through 34 of the data collection instrument. Part 1 includes  demographic variables about the inmate such as birth date, age,  ethnicity, citizenship, years of education, prior employment status,  longest employment, and average weekly income. It also includes  incarceration information such as confinement date, length of current  sentence, RSAT admission date, and expected parole date, and criminal  history information such as age at first adult arrest, number of  juvenile arrests, number of adult arrests, date of first adult arrest,  date of last adult arrest, and number of years served in prison.  There are also variables to address the inmate's drug use history as a  juvenile and as an adult. Part 2 continues with the drug use history  of the inmate as an adult with information about drugs used by IV  injection, number of alcohol withdrawals, number of drug overdoses,  number of detoxes, inpatient treatment received, outpatient treatment  received, average amount of money spent on drugs, percentage of income  spent on drugs, number of family members who use alcohol or drugs, and  how they were related to the inmate. In addition, the file contains  demographic information, such as current marital status and number of  children, and the inmate's psychological history including depression,  anxiety, anger, trouble understanding, concentrating, or remembering,  attempted suicide, prescribed medication, and hospitalization.  Criminal career variables include length of criminal career, all past  cha\nrges, weapons used during any crime, number of times a weapon was used, and total number of convictions."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The goal for this study was to conduct a process  evaluation of the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT)  Program, called the Genesis program, at the Southern New Mexico  Correctional Facility (SNMCD) by examining the program's structure and  assessing its intermediate impact upon participating inmates.
