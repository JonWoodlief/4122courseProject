Views were sought on the 2004 presidential campaign and the war with Iraq, as well as President George W. Bush and his handling of the presidency, the economy, foreign affairs, and the apparent abuse of Iraqi prisoners by United States soldiers in Iraq. Opinions were solicited on whether the war with Iraq was worth fighting, whether it contributed to the long-term security of the United States, whether United States military forces should remain in Iraq until civil order was restored, whether the United States was making significant progress in establishing a democratic government in Iraq, and whether the Bush administration had a clear plan for handling the situation in Iraq. Respondents were asked about their own personal feelings about the situation in Iraq and the apparent abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers, whether the abuse represented a few isolated incidents or a more widespread problem, whether the soldiers involved were acting on their own or following orders, and whether respondents approved of the way Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was handling the United States military's response to the prisoner abuse issue. Those polled also gave their opinions of whether the use of torture or physical abuse on suspected terrorists was ever acceptable and whether the United States government as a matter of policy was using torture and physical abuse as part of the campaign against terrorism. Additional questions polled respondents on how closely they were following the 2004 presidential campaign, whether they would vote for President Bush, Democratic candidate John Kerry, or Independent candidate Ralph Nader, the most important issue in determining their vote, whether Bush or Kerry would do a better job handling the economy, the situation in Iraq, and the campaign against terrorism, and how much respondents felt they knew about each candidate's position on specific issues. Other topics addressed abortion, recent price increases in gasoline, and whether it was appropriate for religious leaders to try to influence politicians' positions on issues. Background information includes sex, education, ethnicity, religion, religiosity, household income, political orientation, political party affiliation, voter registration and participation history, and whether a member of the household was a military veteran."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush
