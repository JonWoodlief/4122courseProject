First, small and large sex worker solicitation sites, including brothel areas and open solicitation points such as roads, highways, bus stands, railway stations, and market areas, were mapped. These lists of solicitation sites were used to define and select site clusters, which were formed by combining small areas or by segmenting the large areas such that each cluster included approximately 500 FSWs. Three such clusters from each district were randomly selected, and FSWs were systematically sampled from the brothel areas and from open solicitation points to obtain a minimum of 1,500 eligible participants per state. Eligibility criteria included those aged 18 years or older who had moved to at least two places, one of which included a move across districts, in the past 2 years of sex work. The sample size was determined using an estimated proportion of 30% non-condom use, an assumed difference of 3% increase in the proportion with every unit increase in degree of mobility, a confidence level of 95% and power of 80%. Across the entire study 9,475 FSWs (out of 10,075 contacted) agreed to be interviewed initially, based on a screening questionnaire. Of these, 59% (n = 5,611) were found eligible according to the eligibility criteria described above.  Of the total eligible FSWs (5,611), 113 were excluded: 15 were not interviewed because they were below age 18 years, 21 have refused to participate, 51 withdrawn from interview in the middle, and for additional 26 the data was missing on socio-economic variables.
