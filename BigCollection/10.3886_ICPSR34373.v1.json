The transition to adulthood has been extensively studied during the last four decades using a variety of well-established approaches and methods. Changes in the structure and pace of youth-to-adult transitions have been extensively documented, along with the increasingly complex lives young people lead as they negotiate the transition to adulthood. Relatively less attention has been devoted to the factors leading to these changes, and a variety of public policies related to state economic development efforts, education, and financial support for higher education have yet to be examined in any detail. This project built on the principal investigators' prior work on life course transitions and state economic and political contexts to estimate behavioral models of the late 20th and early 21st century transition to adulthood.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, this research:\n<ol>\n<li>Defines and describes the successful transition to adulthood in terms of human capital accumulation, attainment of economic security, and partnership and life satisfaction.</li>\n<li>Identifies group and individual disparities in successful transitions, defined by ascribed characteristics, family resources, and personal circumstances.</li>\n<li>Measures the impact of the social and economic environments where these transitions occur and the effects of state structures and policies on the successful transition to adulthood, specifically examining whether the impact of these state policies differs by race/ethnicity, immigrant status, and disability status.</li>\n</ol></p>\n\n<p>The analysis used discrete hazard modeling and hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM) to build a general model of the transition to adulthood on a wide variety of dimensions (from educational attainment to stable employment in a full-time job, employment in a job with health insurance, to independent residence and life satisfaction) and examined systematic changes in the process leading to adulthood across cohorts and across race/ethnic, immigrant, and disability groups.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>To provide important insights into the rapidly changing context surrounding transitions to adulthood by examining a broad spectrum of life-course transitions across three decades (the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s).
