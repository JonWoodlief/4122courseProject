Most of the existing studies have been conducted in an American context, and are inspiring the mobilization efforts by European campaigns. Whether the American findings transfer to Europe is an empirical question, which we address in this article. Specifically, we compile the existing European studies and present two new Danish studies. We show that the pooled point estimate of the effect is substantially smaller in Europe compared to the findings from the US, and find no effects in the two Danish experiments. We discuss why the effects seem to be different in Europe compared to the US and stress the need for further experiments in Europe as there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the European effects. One suggestion is that differences in turnout rates explains the differences in effect sizes. However, the empirical analysis finds no strong relationship between turnout and effects sizes in either Europe or the US.\r\n\r\nReplication for figure 1 and 2 along with Danish from the two Danish Get-out-the-vote Door-to-Door campaigns\r\n\r\nR-files and a readme.file"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-08-30"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mobilization, turnout, Get-Out-The-Vote, door-to-door canvassing, meta-study"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"replication for \"Is Door-to-Door Canvassing Effective in Europe?
