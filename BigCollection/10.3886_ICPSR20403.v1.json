Site validity checks were also conducted during October and the first part of November 1993. Completed felony cohort forms were checked for accuracy against the intake and supervision information located in the offender's file. The CSCD staff assisted in pulling and reviewing the files. The CSCDs not involved in site validity checks sent their first batch of completed forms to TDCJ-CJAD and CJPC for an initial review. The designated Evaluation Coordinator for each CSCD was instructed to collect all Felony Cohort data forms for the department, ensure that forms were completed for each original felony supervision intake, and mail the completed forms to TDCJ-CJAD. Lastly, forms delivered to TDCJ-CJAD were manually checked for reporting errors.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include probationer information, current offense, criminal history, social history, substance abuse, probation sanctions, case classification risk items, and case classification need items.
