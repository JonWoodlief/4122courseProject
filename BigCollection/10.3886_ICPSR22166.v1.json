This poll surveyed 1,127 Maryland residents, including an  oversample of Black respondents, on the upcoming primary and general  elections in their state. Residents were asked whether they approved  of the way President George W. Bush was handling the presidency, their  level of interest in the upcoming elections in Maryland, and whether  they were registered to vote. Registered voters were polled on the  likelihood that they would vote in the Democratic primary and general  election in Maryland, and for whom they would vote in the  gubernatorial and senatorial races. Views were sought on how things  were going in the state of Maryland, the city of Baltimore, and  Montgomery County, and the problems facing the state of Maryland and  the respondents' own community. Respondents gave their opinions of  Governor Bob Ehrlich and First Lady Kendel Ehrlich, the governor's  handling of his job and issues such as the protection of Chesapeake  Bay, and the influence of various groups on his administration.  Opinions were also elicited on Lt. Governor Michael Steele, former  Governor William Donald Schaefer, Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley,  Montgomery County Executive Doug Duncan, Democratic U.S. Senate  candidates Ben Cardin and Kweisi Mfume, and the Democratic and  Republican parties in Maryland. Additional topics addressed the war  in Iraq, slot-machine gambling, gay marriage, abortion, the state  legislature's decision to force Wal-Mart to spend more on employee  health benefits, and the effect of immigration on the respondent's  community. Information was also collected on respondents' county of  residence, and which local television news station they  watched. Demographic variables include sex, age, race, household  income, marital status, education level, type of residential area  (e.g., urban or rural), presence of children in the household,  political party affiliation, political philosophy, voter registration  status, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, and  whether respondents considered themselves born-again or evangelical Christians."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush,
