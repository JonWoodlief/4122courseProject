Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the European Community (EC), including how well-informed they felt about the EC, what sources of information about the EC they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EC member, and the extent of their personal interest in EC matters. One major focus of the study was the general interests of the respondents. Questions included what groups and associations they belonged to, whether they took part in clubs, organizations, or community centers intended for young people, which causes they felt were worth taking risks and making sacrifices for, how they rated certain aspects of their lives and relationships,\nwhich qualities they thought parents should encourage in their children, and what the three major problems facing young people were. Another major focus of the study was on exposure to foreign cultures. Queries included which foreign languages respondents knew, which languages they would like to know, whether they felt enough attention had been paid to foreign languages in school, how much time they had spent traveling abroad, what foreign countries they had visited, whether they had participated in a youth exchange or had worked abroad, which countries they would like to visit for work or study, and what problems were involved in working, studying, or training abroad. Respondents were also asked whether they had ever experienced discrimination, what their financial situation was, whom they talked to when making life course decisions, and whether they used counseling and guidance services. Questions also examined employed respondents' current occupations and employment histories. Unemployed respondents were asked how many months they had been looking for a job, what they had been doing to find a job, and what the main reason was for their being unemployed. Respondents who were still in school or pursuing higher education were asked why they chose to continue studying, at what age they intended to finish their full-time education, why they chose the current subject of their studies, and what their current level of study was. Those respondents who were in a job placement or apprenticeship program were asked questions pertaining to their placement. Respondents no longer in school were asked how many years they studied beyond the minimum for schooling, what their reasons were for finishing formal education when they did, whether they had started a training course, how many training courses they had completed, how many months they had been involved in the training course, what they felt the standard of training was, how much they had gained from the training course, and whether the training had helped them get a job. Additional information was gathered on family income, number of people residing in the home, size of locality, home ownership, region of residence, occupation of the head of household, and the respondent's age, sex, occupation, education, religion, religiosity, subjective social class standing, political party and union membership, and left-right political self-placement."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"associations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"career
