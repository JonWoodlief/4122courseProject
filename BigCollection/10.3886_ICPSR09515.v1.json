Generally, all named features on the most   current largest scale USGS topographic maps were included for Phase I   compilation, available from the ICPSR: GEOGRAPHIC NAMES INFORMATION   SYSTEM: NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC NAMES DATA BASE, POPULATED PLACES IN THE   UNITED STATES (ICPSR 8369). Some categories of named features, however,   were omitted from Phase I because more complete lists of these   categories were available from other sources. Thereafter, available   information from the categories not compiled during Phase I, as well as   geographic names from other sources, are added during Phase II.
