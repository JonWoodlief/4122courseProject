This research investigated the relationship between phantom vibration syndromes, sleep disorder and stress condition. Questionnaires were distributed to 120 participants with age range 18 to 23 years old. Data of participants showed that all of participants using a smart mobile phone and 24% of them have more than one cell phone. Time usage of cell phone is at least 1 hour. 23% of participants using a cell phone for social media activity, followed by 21% related to entertainment (music, video and games). The results showed a positive relationship between phantom vibration syndrome, sleep disorder and stress condition. Insomnia contributed a greater influence on stress condition. However, the phantom vibration syndrome is more directly affecting the sleep apnea compared to insomnia and stress condition. Therefore, the phantom vibration syndrome more affects stress condition indirectly, through sleep disorder (sleep apnea and insomnia). Consequently, phantom vibration syndrome has a strong relationship with stress condition at the time of the phantom vibration syndrome can cause sleep disorder."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Engineering","Medicine, Health and Life Sciences","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Industrial Engineering, Ergonomic"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"JOSI, Editor"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-10-15"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Hubungan Phantom Vibration SyndromeTerhadap Sleep DisorderdanKondisi Stress.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":129315,"dataFile":{"id":3057981,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/L139VP/CUXGJG","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/L139VP/CUXGJG","filename":"Hubungan Phantom Vibration SyndromeTerhadap Sleep DisorderdanKondisi Stress.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":803320,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f1feb4cd9-2079f317f394","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"62d88a072dde3523b91672261ac3cfcb","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"62d88a072dde3523b91672261ac3cfcb"}}}]}}}
