CPSC began operating NEISS in 1972 to monitor product-related injuries treated in United States hospital emergency departments (EDs). In June 1992, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, established an interagency agreement with CPSC to begin collecting data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries in order to monitor the incidents and the characteristics of persons with nonfatal firearm-related injuries treated in United States hospital EDs over time. This dataset represents all nonfatal firearm-related injuries (i.e., injuries associated with powder-charged guns) and all nonfatal BB and pellet gun-related injuries reported through NEISS from 1993 through 2010. The cases consist of initial ED visits for treatment of the injuries. Cases were reported even if the patients subsequently died. Secondary visits and transfers from other hospitals were excluded. Information is available on injury diagnosis, firearm type, use of drugs or alcohol, criminal incident, and locale of the incident. Demographic information includes age, sex, and race of the injured person."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"accidents"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"firearms"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"handguns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nonfatal injuries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"product safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public safety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR III.

There were four hospital-sized strata (defined as very large, large, medium, and small, based on the number of annual ED visits) and one children's hospital stratum. From 1993 through 1996, there were 91 NEISS hospital EDs in the sample. In 1997, the sampling frame was updated so that in 1997 through 1999 the sample included 101 NEISS hospital EDs. In 2000-2001, one NEISS hospital dropped out of the system, so there were 100 NEISS hospital EDs in the sample. In 2002, another hospital dropped out of the system, so there were 99 NEISS hospital EDs in the sampling frame. In 1997, CPSC collected firearm-related cases using the \"old\" and \"new\" NEISS hospital samples for a nine-month period. This dataset includes data from the \"new\" sample. The overlapping \"old\" sample is not included. Comparisons of weighted estimates based on the \"old\" and \"new\" samples indicated a difference of about 1 percent in the overall national estimate using these samples. The characteristics of firearm-related cases from these two overlapping samples were also very similar."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted self interview (CASI)"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Created variable labels and/or value labels."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Firearm Injury Surveillance Study, 1993-2010","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":42233,"dataFile":{"id":2665721,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Firearm Injury Surveillance Study, 1993-2010","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
