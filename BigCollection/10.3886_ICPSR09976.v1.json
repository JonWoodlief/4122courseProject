Data are available from two of the project's  components. In the first component, 201 rapists who were committed to  MTC between 1958 and 1981 were classified. This sample was used to  revise the previous classification system (R2), upon which the  development of the current system rests. Of these 201 men, 94 were in  residence at the time of the study and 107 had been released. The  second component classified a sample of 54 rapists who were committed  after 1981. This sample was not used to develop the criteria for the  typology. As an overview, this project had two missions: (1) to  subtype about 250 rapists using MTC:R3 criteria, and (2) to utilize an  archivally-derived database to examine the concurrent and predictive  validity of the system. In addition to the subtype assignments, the  primary source of data was the detailed institutional files that were used to code a 1,500-variable questionnaire."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To facilitate clinical and forensic decisions  about sex offenders, as well as to further an understanding of the  etiology of sexual aggression, a programmatic effort to develop and  validate taxonomic models to reduce the manifest heterogeneity among  sexual offenders was undertaken.

This typology includes nine subtypes of rapists  that are classified according to dimensions that are resumptively  important in differentiating among rapists (e.g., generalized or  global anger, misogynistic anger, eroticized anger, impulsive,  antisocial personality, degree of preoccupation with gratification of  sexual needs, and social competence). The nine subtypes in this  prototypic system include: (1) Opportunistic offender with Low Social  Competence, (2) Opportunistic offender with High Social Competence,  (3) Pervasively Angry offender, (4) Overt Sadistic offender, (5) Muted  Sadistic offender, (6) Sexualized, Nonsadistic offender with High  Social Competence, (7) Sexualized, Nonsadistic offender with Low  Social Competence, (8) Vindictive offender with Low Social Competence,  and (9) Vindictive offender with Moderate Social Competence. The nine  subtypes are ordered according to similarity of dendogram from a  series of cluster analyses. This project used operational criteria for  MTC:R3 to classify about 250 rapists, representing a model  construction sample and a generalization sample. The system's  reliability and concurrent and predictive validity were examined using an extensive archival database."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Both questionnaire ratings and classification  judgments were made using the extensive clinical files that had been  compiled over the years on all inmates committed to MTC. These files  contained two primary sources of information: data gathered during a  60-day observation period when inmates were referred for evaluation  and data added post-commitment on an inmate's instit\nutional adaptation  and progress in treatment. Post-commitment information routinely  available included MTC records such as treatment progress reports,  behavioral observation reports, work reports, summaries of program  participation, results of psychometric assessments, and annual reports  by an institutional review board. Information collected during the  inmate's observation period included, in addition to diagnostic  assessments and clinical interviews, data from multiple sources  external to MTC, such as past institutionalization records, school and  employment records, police reports, court testimony, parole summaries,  probation records, and social service notes. These reports not only  originated from different agencies, but were also written at different  points in the inmate's life to describe events as they were occurring  at that time. In many cases, social service and school reports that  predated the inmate's first arrest or legal involvement were  available. Access to these original reports helped to counteract the  retrospective biases inherent in file research based largely on  summary reports of a subject's life written after events of particular  importance have already taken place (in this case, after the onset of  criminal activity). Codings were made with the use of a questionnaire  composed of three parts. The first part covered demographic  information and the inmate's educational, occupational, military,  medical, psychiatric, and criminal histories, as well as information  pertaining to alcohol and drug use and detailed familial and  developmental history. The second part of the questionnaire was  comprised of a set of clinically derived scales that globally assessed  the inmates on various aspects of social competence, aggression,  antisocial behavior, and offense style. The third part of the  questionnaire was a symptom checklist used to code the presence,  severity, and/or chronicity of clinical and behavioral symptoms. The  coded file data fall into six major categories: (1) demographic, (2)  alcohol history, (3) family and developmental history, (4) criminal history, (5) clinical symptoms, and (6) major life events."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"behavior problems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offender classification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"rapists"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sex offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sex offender profiles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"treatment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
