Parts 1-5 contain transformed CBP data over a 14-year  period. Each dataset corresponds to a different industry, classified  by 2-digit Standard Industrial Codes (SIC): Primary Metal Industries  (SIC 33), Industrial Machinery and Equipment (SIC 35), Electronic and  Other Electrical Equipment (SIC 36), Transport Equipment (SIC 37), and  Instruments and Related\nProducts (SIC 38). Data for Parts 6-8 contain  hourly ozone readings for a panel of monitors within United States  urban counties in July 1982 and 1987. Part 6 corresponds to monitors  located in counties that were \"in attainment\" in both 1982 and 1987,  Part 7 corresponds to monitors located in counties that were \"out of  attainment\" or in \"partial attainment\" those same years, and Part 8  covers remaining monitors that recorded in both 1982 and 1987 (all  were out of attainment or in partial attainment in 1982).  Part 9  contains Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. The measures  correspond to monitors measuring ground-level ozone (O3).  Other  variables in the file include average county wages and employment by  Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA) and county. Data for  Parts 10-14 are organized as panels. Each case in the panel represents  a United States urban county over an 11-year period (1977-1987),  during which a specified industry had appeared at least once,  according to the CBP number of establishments. The following  industries are covered: Plastic Materials and Synthetics (SIC 282),  Industrial Organic Chemicals (SIC 286), Petroleum Refining (SIC 291),  Miscellaneous Plastic Products (SIC 307), and Blast Furnaces and Basic Steel Products (SIC 331)."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
