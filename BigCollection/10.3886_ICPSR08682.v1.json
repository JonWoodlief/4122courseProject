SPSS would treat each   response as a separate variable, giving\na total of 64 variables instead   of 60.

In the next stage, a random sample of households   was selected from each PSU selected in the first stage. Details of PSU   selection and sampling of households within PSUs were nation-specific   and followed established procedures of survey research within each   country. In the last stage, interviewers chose a respondent from each   selected household, using a random selection procedure devised by   Leslie Kish. The percent of selected respondents from whom interviews   were obtained ranged from 64 percent in Austria to 77 percent in   Britain. The multistage sampling procedure yielded representative   probability samples of the total population in the same age categories   within each country. The procedure contained a very slight household  size bias, except in Britain where there was no bias of this type."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Social Mobility, [1973-1976] An International Social Science Council (ISSC) Workbook in Comparative Analysis","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":41219,"dataFile":{"id":2658801,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Social Mobility, [1973-1976] An International Social Science Council (ISSC) Workbook in Comparative Analysis","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
