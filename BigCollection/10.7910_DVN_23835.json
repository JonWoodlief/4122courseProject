The target sample size was 400 per group, per district for FSW and their clients, high-risk MSM, IDU, and 500 per route category for truckers. In case of transgender in Tamil Nadu, a sample of 400 was selected from five districts combined. Overall, a total of 21103 respondents were covered in IBBA1 and 20226 respondents in IBBA2 (as p\r\ner given data set). Conventional cluster sampling, time-location sampling and respondent driven sampling were the methods used for selection of respondents. Ethical clearance for the assessment was obtained from the ethical committees of participating ICMR institutes and from FHI 360's Protection of Human Subjects Committee (PHSC). Informed consent was taken from the respondents before the administration of questionnaire and sample for biological tests and protection of confidentiality of respondents was given high priority. Intensive training was imparted to all field personnel associated with IBBA. Community preparation was an integral part of IBBA. Independent community advisory boards (CAB) and community monitoring boards (CMB) were formed in each district for each of the survey groups to protect the interest of the survey population."},{"typeName":"researchInstrument","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Structured Questionnaire"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Actual Sample sizes ALL, IBBA","label":"Actual
