CPANDA conducted the following processing steps for release of this collection: produced a codebook, checked for undocumented codes, performed consistency checks, provided frequencies, performed recodes, and reformatted the data.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Three orchestras also classified as major were not included in this study because of short histories and difficulty in securing records: The American Symphony founded 1962; Honolulu, Hawaii; and San Antonio, Texas, founded 1939.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: <p>Data may not be categorized according to modern classifications. For example, when nationality of composers was recorded, it included, as separate categories: England, Scotland, and Britain.</p>\n\n<p>Assigning nationalities to composers was not always a straightforward task for the researchers. The book described the decision-making process as follows: \"For most composers the place of birth gives immediate national identification, except in those cases where political boundaries have shifted in two world wars, notably in the Balkan areas. There are always those special cases however, of composers who change their citizenship either by choice or necessity. 'Unless there are strong reasons to the contrary a composer is allocated for present purposes to the country in which he has produced his major works and in whose culture he has shared and participated. . . Handel is counted as British, Chopin as French. . . Theodore Thomas and Walter Damrosch as American. . .Stravinsky, Schoenberg and others who migrated with mature reputations to the United States are assigned to their respective European origins.'\" (Quoted text within the book was cited as originating in Mueller, John H.
