In particular, the  project extended previous research on criminal careers by developing  and applying an empirical model that accounted for the joint  distribution of violent and nonviolent criminal offending by parolees  in their late teens to mid-20s, during a newly recognized  developmental period of the life course termed \"emerging adulthood.\"  The individuals were released from the CYA at various ages from the  late teens to early 20s, but were all followed for a seven-year  post-parole period. For each individual, the researchers obtained  information on counts of criminal arrests as well as information on  exposure time. Violent arrests included murder, rape, aggravated  assault, robbery, and other person offenses such as extortion and  kidnapping. Nonviolent arrests included burglary, receiving stolen  property, grand theft, forgery, and grand theft auto. Within each  year, individuals were coded as \"free\" for the number of months that  they were not serving time in jail, prison, or CYA  detention. Involvement of the following life circumstances was  recorded: (1) alcohol use, (2) heroin use, (3) full-time employment,  and (4) marriage. A \"month-score\" indicating how many months the  parolee was employed full-time during the course of each of the seven  years of observation was also recorded. Offenders were assumed to have  maintained the same status unless a change was noted in the California  Department of Corrections files. In addition, the researchers  developed an index to gauge an offender's stake in conformity by  combining the life circumstances of marriage and full-time  employment. Variables in the data include year of follow-up, race, age  during that year of follow-up, number of months not serving time,  stake in conformity index score, and number of arrests for violent  offenses, nonviolent offenses, and total offenses.

Despite the number of theories offering credible explanations  for offending continuity, a fundamental disagreement exists over  whether the processes generating offending stability reflect social  mechanisms or stable propensities to offend. This research project  examined whether levels of criminal activity shift in response to  cha\nnges in local life circumstances (e.g., marriage, employment, drug  use, alcohol use, street time). This project advanced prior research  on continuity and change in criminal careers in three ways. First, the  project used a prospective longitudinal dataset of serious offenders  released from the California Youth Authority (CYA) and followed the  offenders over a seven-year post-parole period. This dataset allowed  for a systematic assessment of the relationships between changes in  local life circumstances and changes in offending behavior. An  additional feature of the data was its ability to control for street  time and remove the biases associated with incapacitation. Second, the  project extended previously developed nonparametric statistical models  by developing a method that allowed the examination of how life  circumstances relate to the joint distribution of violent and  nonviolent offending, which previous research had not yet  examined. Third, the project explored the extent to which the  relationship between life circumstances and criminal offending varies  during the late teens through the mid-20s, a newly recognized  developmental period of the life course termed \"emerging adulthood\"  characterized by change and a process of exploration of possible life directions."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The dataset for this project provides information  on 524 male juvenile offenders released from CYA institutions from  1965-1984.

Local life  circumstances were coded in terms of change in status. Offenders were  assumed to have maintained the same status unless a change was noted  in the California Department of Corrections files. The above four  local life circumstances were examined because each has been found to  be related to persistence/desistance in criminal offending. In  addition, the researchers followed previous research and developed an  index to gauge an offender's stake in conformity by combining the life  circumstances of marriage and full-time employment. This index  allowed for a more direct examination of the impact of collective or cumulative amounts of informal social control on offending behavior."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include year of follow-up (Year 1 to Year  7), race (nonwhite/white), age during that year of follow-up, number  of months not serving time, stake in conformity index score, and  number of arrests for violent offenses, nonviolent offenses, and total  offenses.
