Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, New York State governor George Pataki, former president Ronald Reagan, Vice President Al Gore, Texas governor George W. Bush, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, First Lady Hillary Clinton, New York City mayor Giuliani, and political activist Al Sharpton. Regarding the upcoming Senate race, respondents were asked how much attention they were paying to the upcoming election, for whom they would vote, and whether that decision was firm or not. They were also asked which of the two potential candidates cared more about people like the respondent and about people living in New York City, its suburbs, and upstate New York, which candidate would do a better job at reforming health care, improving education, reducing crime, and representing respondents' interests in the Senate, which candidate had the right kind of experience for the job and would work well with other senators, which candidate would \"protect access to legal abortion\" best, and which candidate had the honesty and integrity respondents wanted to see in a United States senator from New York. Respondents were asked to rate the two candidates as liberal, moderate, or conservative, to assess their individual motives in running for the Senate seat, should they choose to run, to give their opinions on the recent Brooklyn Museum of Art controversy, and to comment on whether recent White House scandals were a legitimate issue for the Senate campaign. Referring to Giuliani, respondents were asked whether they approved or disapproved of his handling of the job of New York City mayor overall, and specifically in his dealings with crime, education, race relations, and economic development issues. Referring to Clinton, respondents were asked whether they approved or disapproved of her handling of the role of First Lady, and whether her relatively recent move to New York State created problems for her Senate candidacy. Respondents were also queried about the upcoming presidential campaign in 2000, including whether they were paying attention to the campaign news, whether they were registered or planned to vote for a major party, whom they wanted as the Republican and Democratic nominees, and how they would vote in potential match-ups. Other issues probed included President Clinton's recent offer of clemency to jailed Puerto Rican nationalists and members of the group F.A.L.N., the Jonathan Pollard spy case, what to do with prospective federal budget surpluses, raising the minimum wage, the state of health care in the United States, abortion, and fan loyalty to New York baseball teams. Background information on\nrespondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, voter registration and participation history, political party, political orientation, Hispanic descent, marital status, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush, George W."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Hillary"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional campaigns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Giuliani, Rudolph"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gore, Al"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"party identification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political affiliation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voter expectations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
