Respondents were asked whether they were familiar with the  European Code Against Cancer, how they felt about the sun, how much  time they spent in the sun, how they felt about exposing their  children to the sun, whether they had ever been sunburned, and whether  any immediate family member had been diagnosed with cancer or  skin cancer. Information on respondents' skin, eye, and natural hair  color was also elicited. Questions regarding smoking focused on  whether the respondent ever smoked or used to smoke but quit, and  whether they smoked manufactured cigarettes, roll-your-own cigarettes,  cigars, or pipes. Smokers were asked how many cigarettes a day they  smoked, if they would like to stop smoking, how many of their friends  and family members smoked, and if they supported or opposed a  regulation to prohibit smoking in public places. Demographic variables  include age, gender, marital status, occupation, income, number of children, and country of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cancer"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"skin cancer"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"smoking"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XV.B.
