Students wh\no did not fulfill one or more of these requirements for age (0 cases), grade (249 cases), enrollment (245 cases), and home schooling (203 cases) were deleted from the analysis.

Sixty-three percent of the sample was White, non-Hispanic; 12 percent was Black, non-Hispanic; 19 percent was of Hispanic origin; and 6 percent of the sample was of other, non-Hispanic race/ethnicities. Nine percent of the sample were 6th graders; 7th, 8th, and 9th graders each accounted for 15 percent of the sample; 16 percent were in 10th grade; and 11th and 12th graders each accounted for 14 percent.
