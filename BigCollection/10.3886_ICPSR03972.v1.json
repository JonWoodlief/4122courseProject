Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way United States President George W. Bush was handling international policies, whether their respective countries should be involved in world affairs, whether the United States should be the only superpower, whether the European Union should become a superpower, or whether there should be no superpowers. On the issue of whether the European Union should become a superpower, respondents were asked whether they would make the same decision if it required an increase in military expenditures. Additional questions included whether the relationship between Europe and the United States had grown closer, further apart, or stayed the same, whether the United States or the European Union was more important to the respondent's own country, whether the war in Iraq was worth the human and economic costs, and whether the respondent could name five countries that were permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Opinions were gathered on how desirable it was that the United States and/or the European Union exert strong leadership in world affairs, the appropriateness of spending on defense, economic foreign aid, and social welfare and health by respondents' governments, the proper role of the European Union in the world, and the level of potential threat to the United States and/or the European Union by a variety of events and issues. Additional opinions were elicited on countries other than the respondent's own country, on the United Nations, on support for military action or economic sanctions against countries with weapons of mass destruction or nuclear weapons, and on proposals to aid in the resolution of the Arab or Palestinian conflict with Israel. Background variables include age, sex, education, ethnicity, the number of people aged 18 and over in the household, occupation, party preference, and residential region."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Arab Israeli conflict"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic sanctions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Union"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international affairs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military alliances"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military interventions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"NATO"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United Nations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
