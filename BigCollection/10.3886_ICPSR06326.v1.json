This survey   repeated questions from a companion poll (WCBS-TV NEWS/NEW YORK TIMES   NEW JERSEY POLL #1, SEPTEMBER 1993 [ICPSR 6323]) that assessed   respondents' opinions of the candidates and perceptions of their   abilities and qualifications, as well as focusing on Jim Florio's   performance as governor compared with past New Jersey governors.   Additional questions asked whether Florio and Whitman had offered   specific proposals for solving New Jersey's problems, whether Florio   and Whitman had spent more campaign time attacking each other or   explaining what they would do if elected, and whether Florio or Whitman   was more responsible for negative campaigning. October respondents were   asked about Governor Florio's decision to raise taxes in light of his   1989 campaig\nn promise to the contrary, and the implications of   Christine Todd Whitman's campaign promise to cut state income taxes by   30 percent over three years. The October survey also included questions   dealing with the truthfulness and impact of Florio and Whitman's   television commercials during the campaign. Background information on   respondents includes voter registration status, financial situation   compared to four years ago, political party, political orientation,   vote choice in the 1992 presidential and 1989 New Jersey gubernatorial   elections, whether the respondent would describe the chief wage   earner's job as \"blue collar,\" county of residence, religious   preference, education, age, race, Hispanic origin, sex, and family  income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
