Secondary objectives were to evaluate the   effects of aspirin in this group on the incidence of coronary heart   disease mortality, coronary incidence, fatal or nonfatal strokes, and   intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks. Other objective\ns were to   evaluate side or adverse effects of long-term aspirin therapy, to study   the natural history of coronary heart disease by following patients in   a placebo group, and to advance the methodology of long-term   cooperative clinical trials. Initial Visit Form variables include age,   sex, race, birthdate, lifestyle, work status, and marital status, as   well as thorough physical examinations to determine the patient's   general condition. Included in the first and followup exams are   variables on heart problems, other medical problems, causes of death,   medications, smoking, alcohol consumption, and extensive laboratory  tests."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cardiovascular disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mortality"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"preventive medicine"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
