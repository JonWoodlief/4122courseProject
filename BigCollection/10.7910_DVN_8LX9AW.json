The five studies are:\r\n<br />  <br />  1. White Group 1, 1938-1940: 20 Harvard College undergraduates were studied in 1938-1939. Nine of the men were followed up in 1939-1940, and three were studied a third time in 1949-1950.<br />  <br />  2. White Group 2, 1945: Four Harvard and four Radcliffe undergraduates were studied intensively. <br />  <br />  3. Smith-Bruner-White Group, 1946-1947: Ten men aged mid-20s to mid-40s were studied. This study focused on the relationship between personality and political opinions a\r\nnd attitudes. <br />  <br />  4. White Group 3, 1944-1950: Eleven students, seven male and four female, were studied by graduate students in psychology at Harvard. <br />  <br />  5. White-Riggs Group, 1963-1965: Seven extensive and unstructured life history interviews were conducted, two of women and five of men. Follow-up interviews in 1966, 1969, 1976, and 1980 were conducted with one of the female participants.<br /><br />  Data collected from some or all of these participants include a written autobiography; extensive interviews covering family, parents' personalities, early memories, school and college history, social relationships, health, sex, religious beliefs, emotions, abilities and talents, current interests, ethical values, opinions and attitudes, and general outlook on life; standardized tests such as the Wechsler-Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test, the Vygotsky Concept Formation Values, Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), a sentence completion test, and a free association hour. In addition, for older participants and in follow-up studies, extensive interviews concerning relationships with parents and siblings, marriage and family, childbearing, occupational satisfactions and frustrations, social life, and personal values and ideals were conducted.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds original record paper data from all 56 cases (<b>The data have been digitized and are available for on-line access.)</b>  <br/><br /><b>Audio Data Availability Note:</b> This study contains audio data that have been digitized.
