The objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate cholesterol removal rate of the CR cheese, (2) determine nutrient composition of CC and CR cheeses and (3) compare pH, lipolysis, textural and sensory characteristics of the 2 types of cheeses stored at 3 different temperatures for 3 storage periods. Results showed that mean contents (%) of moisture, fat, ash, protein, and carbohydrate of CC cheeses were: 41.4, 26.9, 3.87, 28.2 and 3.87, and those of CR cheeses were: 41.1, 22.9, 4.84, 35.1, and 3.93, respectively. The fat content of CR cheese was significantly lower than that of CC cheese, indicating that significant part of fat was lost during cream separation of the original cheese milk. Mean cholesterol concentration (mg/100g cheese) of control and cholesterol removed cheese were 115.062 and 81.97 respectively, suggesting that the cholesterol removal rate was only 28.7 %, which is substantially lower than previous reports on bovine milk cheese studies. With respect to pH changes in CC and CR cheeses during the 4 month storage at -18, 4 and 22 °C temperatures, CC cheese had lower pH than CR cheese. There were no significant differences in pH values for the different temperatures. However, the 2-way interaction effect of cheese type x storage period showed significant (P<0.01) differences in pHs, Concerning textural characteristics of the experimental cheeses, the textural parameters of CC cheese had higher mean values than those of CR cheese for fresh samples. The ADV values of control cheeses were higher than that of CR cheese samples. The 3-way interaction effect of cheese type x temperature x storage period showed highly significant effect on acid degree value in both CC and CR cheeses. The 2-way interaction of storage time x batch effect was also significant (P<0.01 and P<001) for ADV values.The results of sensory evaluation on the CC and CR goat Cheddar cheeses revealed that cooked flavor was not affected by main factors nor by their interactions. However, storage period made greater influence on sweetness, freshness, high acid, coarse, crumbly, sandy and color of the experimental cheese samples. On the other hand, storage temperature had no impact on any of the sensory properties.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"bastola, krishna"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-12-01"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Research Paper.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":147538,"dataFile":{"id":3320548,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6EYSYO/6ULJKM","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6EYSYO/6ULJKM","filename":"Research Paper.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":349706,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1676a71c5a3-e9f0543a9eee","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"3d8b9e51a38c02fc0848560b7a15e70d","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"3d8b9e51a38c02fc0848560b7a15e70d"}}}]}}}
