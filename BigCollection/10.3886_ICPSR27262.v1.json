This data collection describes the academies in terms of their personnel, expenditures, facilities, curricula, and trainees using data from the 2006 Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Training Academies (CLETA) sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The 2006 CLETA, like the initial 2002 study, collected data from all state and local academies that provided basic law enforcement training. Academies that provided only in-service training, corrections and detention training, or other special types of training were excluded.

An initial screening verified telephone number, mailing address, and other academy contact information. The survey instrument was subsequently mailed to 734 academies. After the initial mailing, 13 additional academies were added, resulting in a total of 747 academies receiving the survey. During the course of survey administration, 99 academies were determined to be out of scope because they did not conduct basic law enforcement training during the study reference period. Of the 648 academies finally determined to be eligible to receive the survey, all but one responded to all (or nearly all) of the questions. A majority (54.3 percent) of the responses were received by mail. About a third (34.2 percent) were submitted electronically through the survey website, and 11.4 percent were transmitted by fax."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"census data"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"law enforcement agencies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police departments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police recruits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
