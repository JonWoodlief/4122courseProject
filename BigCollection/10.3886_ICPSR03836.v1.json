Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill   Clinton and his handling of the presidency and the economy. A series   of questions addressed whether President Clinton and the Republicans   in Congress were trying to work with or against each other and   whether this was a good or bad thing, whether Clinton or the   Republicans would do a better job dealing with the country's   problems, whether the changes they were seeking were right or wrong   for the country, and which cared more about serving lower income,   middle income, and upper income people. Questions were posed   regarding how well the United States Congress was doing its job,   whether Congress was able to deal with the main issues facing the   country, and whether the federal government should be allowed to   impose regulations on state and local governments without providing   the necessary funding. Respondents were polled on whether they   supported or opposed issues such as banning assault weapons, raising   the minimum wage, imposing term limits for United States   Representatives, and giving loan guarantees to Mexico. Those surveyed   were asked whether balancing the federal budget would make the   country's problems better or worse, whether it could be done without   cutting useful government programs, which programs should be cut, the   percentage of federal tax dollars that they felt were wasted, and   whether they supported or opposed a constitutional amendment   requiring a balanced federal budget. Questions regarding the   professional major league baseball strike polled respondents on   whether they sided with the players or the owners, whether there   should be a limit on players' earnings, whether they believed the   owners' claims that some teams could be forced to move if players'   salaries were not limited, and whether replacement players should be   used. Several questions asked whether respondents considered   themselves baseball fans, how closely they would follow the season if   replacement players were used, whether the league playoffs and World   Series should be cancelled if the strike was not settled by the end   of the season, whether the strike would hurt baseball's popularity,   and whether or not President Clinton and Congress should force a   settlement of the strike. A series of questions addressed how often   respondents flew on commercial airlines, what factors were important   in choosing an airline, and the overall safety of commercial air   travel. Opinions were solicited on Newt Gingrich's handling of his   job as Speaker of the House of Representatives, whether respondents   had heard or read anything about his book publishing contract, and if   he did anything illegal or wrong in the book deal. Respondents were   also polled on whether their family's financial situation was better,   worse, or about the same compared to two years ago and the degree to   which President Clinton was responsible, whether they considered   themselves religious or spiritual, and how often they prayed or   attended religious services. Additional questions asked respondents   how closely they followed the O.J. Simpson case, whether he was   guilty or not guilty, and whether the news coverage of the trial was   good or bad. Background variables include sex, age, ethnicity,   household income, marital status, employment status, religion,   education, subjectiv\ne size of community, political orientation,   political party, labor union membership, social class, whether the   respondent was registered to vote, whether they voted in the 1992   presidential election, and if so, for whom (Democrat Bill Clinton,  Republican George H.W. Bush, or Independent candidate Ross Perot)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"air travel"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"balanced budget"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"baseball"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Clinton, Bill"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Gingrich, Newt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national economy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidency"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential performance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"religious beliefs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Simpson, O.J."},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Congress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
