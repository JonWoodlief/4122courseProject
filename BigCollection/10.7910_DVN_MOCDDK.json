In this work we review the theory of the magnetohydrodynamic tearing instability in the general case of an arbitrary tearing parameter, which is relevant for applications in turbulence. We discuss a detailed derivation of the results for the standard Harris profile and accompany it by the derivation of the results for a lesser known sine-shaped profile. We devote special attention to the exact solution of the inner equation, which is the central result in the theory of tearing instability. We also briefly discuss the influence of shear  flows on tearing instability in magnetic structures. Our presentation is self-contained; we expect it to be accessible to researchers in plasma turbulence who are not experts in magnetic reconnection"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Physics"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"flows"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reconnection"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"tearing mode"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"theory"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"turbulence"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<a href=\"http://library.psfc.mit.edu/catalog/reports/2010/18ja/18ja023/abstract.php\">PSFC REPORT PSFC/JA-18-23</a><br /><br />S Boldyrev was partly supported by the NSF grant no.
