Two sets of non-cadet recruits from the academy were also included in the research. Major variables in the data collection detail reasons for entry into the police department, opinions regarding police, and perceptions and attitudes toward the police cadet program. Some questionnaires also provided information on demographic characteristics of the cadets (race, sex, marital status, military service and branch, highest level of education, family income, and year of birth).

The New York City Police Cadet Corps  was established as an innovative recruitment program designed to  attract college students into careers as police officers through a  monetary incentive which included an interest-free loan and monies for  work performed. The five major objectives for the program were to (1)  increase the educational level of the department, (2) test a more  rigorous selection process for recruits, (3) increase the  representativeness of the uniformed force, (4) increase the  orientation toward community policing, and (5) improve leadership  skills of new officers. The Police Foundation conducted this study to  evaluate how well the program was implemented during its initial  stages and the extent to which, during that period, it achieved its  goals. The evaluation of the program was designed to answer questions  such as (1) How was the program recruitment implemented, and with what  success?

The program consisted of ten phases that cadets  completed: (1) meet entrance criteria, (2) participate in the Summer  Program during the summer after their sophomore year, (3) participate  in an eight-week Community Patrol Office Program (Stage One) after a  two-week training and orientation period, (4) receive training during  their junior year consisting of part-time work in precinct assignments  and special training, (5) participate in a ten-week Community Patrol  Officer Program (Stage Two) between their junior and senior years, (6)  receive training during their senior year, (7) pass the police  entrance exam, (8) graduate from college, (9) be promoted to police  officer, (10) graduate from the police academy. Beginning in the  summer of 1986 and continuing through to the end of 1989, various  survey instruments were administered to cadets upon their entry into  the Police Cadet Corps program, after their first summer, at the end  of the program, at their entry into the police academy, and at their  exit from the academy. The study did not cover the academy entry and  exit for the 1988 cohort, nor did the 1987B cohort complete a first  summer survey. For comparison purposes, 1988 non-cadet recruits in the  police academy were given surveys at their entry and exit from the  academy in 1988.

Cadets who had experienced police duty were queried on  items such as the amount of time spent on different tasks, how useful  they felt those assignments were, the usefulness of their police work  experience, and their impression of the Community Patrol Officer  Program. Also asked were questions on how the Community Patrol program  had affected cadets' attitudes toward the Cadet Corps program and  their possible police careers and future plans.
