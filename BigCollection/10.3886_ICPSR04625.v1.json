Despite being termed a monthly poll, this poll's specific  focus was on the opinions and judgments of people currently living in  the state of New York. Respondents were asked to give their opinions  on the upcoming 2006 election for the New York governor, specifically  their opinions about gubernatorial candidates, Eliot Spitzer and John  Faso. Subjects were also asked about the upcoming New York senatorial  election and their opinions about that race's candidates, Hillary  Clinton and John Spencer. Respondents were also asked about the  upcoming election for state attorney general and their opinions about  candidates Andrew Cuomo and Jeanine Pirro. Respondents were asked to  give their opinions about several politicians: President George Bush,  Governor George Pataki, Senator Charles Schumer, Senator Hillary  Clinton, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Respondents were asked how they  thought the New York legislature in Albany was handling its job, and  of the problems facing New York State, what they wanted the next  governor to concentrate on most. Respondents were also asked to rate  the state of the New York economy. Respondents were then asked to give  their opinion on sentencing for people convicted of murder and  terrorism. Other major issues such as gay marriage and the war in Iraq  were also covered, along with additional topics specific to New York  such as balancing the budget, future terrorist attacks, education,  taxes, and which candidate for senator would help improve on these  areas. Additionally respondents were asked which candidate for Senator  cared most for people in different areas of New York: New York City,  the suburbs, and upstate New York. Respondents were also asked how  they thought the candidates for governor would handle issues such as  taxes, terrorism, and the economy. Additional questions asked  respondents how they would categorize the political attitudes of the  candidates for governor and senator. Their opinions were sought on  Hillary Clinton's job as senator, whether she had become a true New  Yorker, and the prospect of her running for president, and whether  Rudolph Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, or George Pataki should run for  president in 2008. Respondents were asked their views on Andrew Cuomo  and Jeanine Pirro, including information about their campaign  practices and their experience level. Lastly, they were asked if they  would want the Mets or the Yankees to win if there were a subway World  Series that year. Demographic variables include race, sex, age, level  of education, financial situation, income, voter registration, voting  activity, status, political ideology, party affiliation, marital  status, religious affiliation, a\nnd number of years living in their current community."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"baseball"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bloomberg,
