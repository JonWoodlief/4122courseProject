As the child became older, data collection was expanded to include other contexts within which the child interacted.<br /><br />  When the child was approximately three years of age, 100 mothers and 93 fathers were interviewed and asked to complete the Parental Attitude Research Instrument (Schaefer and Bell, 1958). Researchers also completed an evaluation of the home environment of the subjects and of any special environmental circumstances\r\n(e.g., separations, divorces, remarriages, deaths). In adolescence and early adulthood, interviews were conducted separately with both the child and his/her parents. These interviews included additional questions about college plans, career goals, and sexual and social functioning. During the adolescent assessment, one-third of the respondents completed the Offer Self-Image Questionnaire.\r\n<br /><br />  The Murray Research Archive holds transcripts, interviews, rating scales, grade summaries, clinical interviews, observation transcripts, and school reports (for  1956-1988 data).
