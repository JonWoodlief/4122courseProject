The prospective data were selected  from data collected as part of the Johns Hopkins Collaborative  Perinatal Study (JHCPS), a survey of pregnant women seeking prenatal  care and delivery at Johns Hopkins Hospital during 1960-1964. JHCPS  studied these women (the first-generation mothers, abbreviated as G1)  and the children born to them during 1960-1965 (the second-generation  children, abbreviated as G2) until the children were 8 years old. The  retrospective data come from a follow-up study, conducted in  1992-1994, of G1, G2, and the children born to G2 (the  third-generation children, abbreviated as G3). Data from JHCPS on G1  include obstetrical and reproductive history at registration for  prenatal care, sociological/family history variables at or around  delivery of G2, observations of mother with child when G2 was 4 months  old and 8 months old, and family history, demographic, and  sociological variables when G2 was age 7. For G2, the data from JHCPS  include delivery room observations at birth, pediatric examination  data at age 4 months, developmental evaluation data at age 8 months,  pediatric-neurological examination data at age 12 months, language,  hearing, and speech evaluation summary data at age 36 months,  psychological, behavior profile, physical growth, and other tests at  age 48 months, psychological, motor, behavior, neurological, vision,  physical, and other tests at age 7-1/2 years, and language, hearing,  and speech evaluations, physical growth, interval medical history, and  other tests at age 8 years. Retrospective data from the follow-up  study on G1 include variables on education, employment, family  composition, health and health care usage, housing conditions, income  and income sources, marital status, partnerships and changes,  neighborhood characteristics at registration to JHCPS and current, and  reproductive history. For G2, data from the follow-up include  information on aspirations, education, schooling, employment, family  composition, health and health care usage, housing conditions, income  and income sources, legal problems, living arrangements, marriage,  partnership and changes, neighborhood characteristics at birth, at  ages 11/12 and 16/17, and current, reproductive history, social  relationships, smoking, and substance abuse. Data for the assessed  third-generation children, i.e., G3s who were 7-8 years old during the  follow\n-up period, include information on cognitive development,  academic achievement and behavior, prenatal care, health, day care, and parental aspirations."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"birth"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"neighborhood characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pregnancy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"prenatal care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"psychological evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reproductive history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"urban areas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR XII.
