In the wet season period of 2004 and dry season period of2005, fields trials were conducted at Ndiaye (16o 14’N, 16o14’W) and Fanaye (16.33’N, 15o46’W) in the Senegal River Valley to evaluate new interspecific genotypes for intensified double cropping of irrigated rice. The experiment design was a split –split –plot with two replications. The seed quantity from the same source was enough for two replications, two sites and two seasons. Outstanding interspecific genotypes yielding 7-8 t ha were identified. WAS 122-IDSA-10-WAS-10-WAB-2-WAS-1 was the highest yielding variety at the two sites (8117 kg ha). WAS191-4-WAB-1-WAS-1 yielded more than 8 t ha at Fanaye in each season. Most of the interspecific genotypes matured earlier than the sativa checks. These findings have potential practical value for the double cropping systems in Senegal River Valley and Delta."}}]},{"typeName":"productionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2012-09-06"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Senegal"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"West Africa"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["N’diaye, Fanaye"]}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"PYTCOMBHIV04CS05.xls","restricted":true,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":43610,"dataFile":{"id":2420231,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"PYTCOMBHIV04CS05.xls","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":61440,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:91393","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d8e504810b083bb116553158c78b76d9","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d8e504810b083bb116553158c78b76d9"}}}]}}}
