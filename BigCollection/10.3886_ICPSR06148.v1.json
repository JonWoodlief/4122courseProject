Respondents were asked to describe their first residential burglary,  to recreate verbally the most recent residential burglary they had  committed, to discuss their perceptions of the risk values involved  with burglary, and to describe the process through which they selected  potential targets for burglaries. In-depth, semistructured interviews  lasting from one and a half to three hours were conducted in which  participants were allowed to speak freely and informally to the  investigator. These interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed  verbatim, and some were later annotated with content-related markers  or \"tags\" to facilitate analysis.
