Issues covered include the FBI's handling   of the standoff, the initial raid on the Branch Davidian compound by   federal agents in February 1993 and the resulting shootout leading to   the standoff, and the FBI's effort to end the standoff by knocking   holes in the cult's compound and pumping tear gas into the house.   Respondents were asked if they thought the FBI should have waited   longer before taking action to end the standoff, whether the fire   that destroyed the compound was set on purpose by the cult members,   and whether the deaths of the cult members could have been avoided if   the standoff had been handled differently by the authorities.   Additional questions concerned the amount of blame Koresh, his   foll\nowers, the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and   Firearms, United States Attorney General Janet Reno, and President   Bill Clinton deserved for the incident, and the effect of the Waco   incident on the respondent's confidence in Clinton's ability to   handle a crisis. Background information on respondents includes  political party, age, and sex."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
