In addition to posing the standar\nd  monthly questions, these two surveys also contained items focusing on  the crisis in Haiti. On September 18, before United States troops were  sent to Haiti, 747 respondents were queried. The next day, 504  individuals were recontacted for the callback portion of the  survey. Respondents were asked whether they approved of President Bill  Clinton's handling of the situation in Haiti, whether the United  States had a responsibility to do something to restore democracy in  Haiti, and whether the United States should send troops or try to  find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Opinions were solicited on  former President Jimmy Carter's role in the crisis and the extent of  the role United States military troops should play in  Haiti. Respondents were asked to evaluate various reasons for  involvement in Haiti, such as stopping human rights abuses, aiding  Haitian refugees, and ensuring political stability in the Caribbean,  and whether these reasons were sufficient to risk American  troops. Background information on respondents includes voter  registration status, household composition, vote choice in the 1992  presidential election, political party, political orientation, education, age, sex, race, religious preference, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
