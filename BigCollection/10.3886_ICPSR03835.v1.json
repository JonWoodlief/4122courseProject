Respondents were   polled immediately following the address on whether they had watched   any of it, whether they approved or disapproved of most of what   President Clinton said, and whether they supported or opposed   specific proposals such as raising the minimum wage, giving tax   breaks to middle class families with children, continuing funding for   Americorps, and spending more money to enforce laws against illegal   immigration. Opinions were solicited on whether President Clinton or   the Republicans in Congress was taking a stronger leadership role in   government and whether it was a good or bad thing, whether the   country should go in the direction that President Clinton or the   Republicans in Congress wanted it to go, and whether Clinton deserved   a second term as president.
