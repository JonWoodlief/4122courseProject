Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the European Union (EU), including how well-informed they felt about the EU, whether their country had benefited from being an EU member, and the extent of their personal interest in EU matters.  Further questions on the EU included the extent of EU involvement in various policy areas and the importance of these issues, further European integration, economic growth, and trust in EU organizations.  The survey also queried respondents about these six major topical areas: (1) Globalization, (2) Personal Values and Priorities, (3) European Identity, (4) Future of the European Union, (5) Social Problems and Welfare, and (6) European Elections. For the first major topic, respondents were asked for their opinions on globalization and its effect on the local community, companies, and the EU.  For the second major topic, respondents were asked about their values and priorities.  The survey then asked respondents about the third topic, European Identity.  Respondents were questioned about their national and European identities, what they thought were the important characteristics and elements of their identities, and what their identities mean to them.  For the fourth topic, the future of the European Union, respondents were asked about their predictions for the year 2030 in regards to the economy, expansion, societal norms, and culture. For the fifth topic, social problems and welfare, respondents were asked about social welfare and pensions, and the quality of their country's plans and possible future changes to the programs.  Respondents were also questioned about employment possibilities in their country, including whether highly educated people had problems obtaining jobs. The sixth major topic focused on the European Parliament elections, respondents were asked their reasons for voting or not voting, what they felt were important policy issues, t\nheir attitudes toward the elections, their exposure to election campaigns, and their closeness to the political parties.  In addition to the six major areas of focus, four minor topics were also covered: (1) Human Rights, (2) Public Authorities, (3) Minorities and Immigrants, and (4) Elderly Care. Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, origin of birth (personal and parental), marital status, occupation, age at completion of full-time education, left-right political self placement, level in society, household composition, ownership of a fixed or mobile telephone, ownership of household durables, financial situation, Internet usage, and quality of life pertaining to health. In addition, country-specific data includes region of residence, type and size of locality, and language of interview (select
