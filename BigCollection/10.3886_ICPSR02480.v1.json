This study  examined this informal network and its role in the dissemination of  police research. The Police Communication Network Survey was mailed  to the chief executives of 517 local departments and all 49 state  police and highway patrol organizations in March 1996. The chief was  asked to forward the questionnaire to the commander of the  department's planning and research unit. Questions covered the agency  most frequently contacted, how frequently this agency was contacted,  mode of communication used most often, why this agency was contacted,  and the agency most likely contacted on topics such as domestic  violence, deadly force, gangs, community policing, problem-oriented  policing, drug enforcement strategies, civil liability, labor  relations, personnel administration, accreditation, and police traffic  services. Information was also elicited on the number of times  different law enforcement agencies contacted the respondent's agency  in the past year, the percentage of time devoted to responding to  requests for information from other agencies, and the amount of  training the respondent and the staff received on the logic of social  research, research design, statistics, operations research,  cost-benefit analysis, evaluation research, and computing.

There are thousands of  federal, state, and local agencies, ranging in size from a one-officer  rural department to incredibly complex organizations in large cities.  All of these departments require information relative to changes in  policy, law, and practice. In order to meet these demands, two systems  have developed. The first system is formal. It centers on the  distribution of information by federal government agencies such as the  National Institute of Justice and by professional organizations such  as the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the  Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), the Police Foundation, and the  International Association of Law Enforcement Planners. This system  provides enormous amounts of research to a vast array of clients.  There is, however, another system engaged in these dissemination  efforts. It is an informal system of information-sharing in which  police planners and others contact other law enforcement agencies  directly to gather the information they need to manage their  departments. This study examined several aspects of this informal  network and its role in the dissemination of police research,  specifically: (1) What agencies are planners most likely to contact  when they look for information? (2) How frequent are these contacts?  (3) What are the modes of communication? (4) What factors influence  the choice of a contact? (5) What are the resource requirements  associated with these requests? (6) Are requests information-specific?  (7) How well are police planning and research units prepared to conduct research?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To examine how the system of information-sharing  among police organizations works, this research collected data using a  national survey of police planning and research commanders.
