All four projects used a common unit of analysis, namely all  200 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs) that, according to  the 1970 Census, had a population of less than 1,500,000 and were  entirely located within a single state. In each project, a limited  amount of information was collected for all 200 SMSAs. More extensive  data were gathered within independently drawn samples of these SMSAs,  for all local geographical units and each administrative jurisdiction  or agency in the service delivery areas. Two standardized systems of  geocoding -- the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes  and the Office of Revenue Sharing (ORS) codes -- were used, so that  data from various sources could be combined. The use of these two  coding schemes also allows users to combine data from two or more of  the research projects conducted in conjunction with the present one,  or to add data from a wide variety of public data files. The present  study investigated the delivery of solid waste collection and disposal  service, focusing on the differences in efficiency and effectiveness  of the public and private sectors. Six major research tasks were  undertaken in the first phase of the project: identification of the  prevalence of alternative collection arrangement types, analysis of  prevailing solid waste collection practices, analysis of cost  components of residential refuse collection, econometric analyses of  the relative efficiency of the three main arrangement types (municipal  collection, local contract service, and franchised service),  efficiency of alternative regulatory schemes for residential solid  waste collection, and identification of prevailing service  arrangements for solid waste disposal. For the purposes of the study,  estimates of true cost were made from a variety of data sources. The  basic research instrument was a telephone survey conducted in 1,377  cities with populations exceeding 2,500, located in the 200 previously  selected SMSAs. This survey obtained information on the means of  collection, means of payment, quality of service, and coverage of  households. In 102 of these cities, subsequ\nent field visits were used  to obtain cost information for municipal collection. In an additional  163 cities, where individuals arranged for their own collection, a  telephone survey of households was conducted to identify contracting  firms and to ascertain the quality of service. Additional data were  collected from 42 franchise operators and from contractors in 242  cities. Legal information was collected on contract and ordinance  provisions, regulatory matters, and state law relating to arrangements  for the provision of these kinds of services. Information from these  sources was combined with data obtained from the International City  Management Association and the 1970 Census of Housing and  Population. Part 1 contains all the data collected at the city  level. Part 2 provides information for the 281 counties in which the 1,377 municipalities were located."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cost analysis"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"counties"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"econometrics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"municipal services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pollution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public sector"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"private sector"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sanitation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"solid wastes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"waste disposal"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"waste management"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR VIII.C.
