These SHS represent about 60% of all SHS in the selected districts.\r\n(4) Within each selected SHS, all students officially admitted into the SHS as of October 2008 were considered for eligibility.\r\n\r\nTo be considered eligible for the study, students needed to satisfy the following criteria: \r\n(1) To have been placed into one of the 177 study SHS by the Computerized School Selection and Placement System (CSSPS);\r\n(2) To have attended a Junior High School (JHS) in the same district (referred to as “in-district students”) as the SHS they were admitted to; \r\n(3) To have not yet enrolled in any SHS by October 2008 (the school year had started in September).\r\n\r\nThrough visits to both senior and junior high schools, and various interviews with headmasters, teachers and other students conducted in October 2008, we identified 2,246 students eligible for the study. Because each year fewer girls are admitted into SHS than boys, in order ensure we had enough eligible girls in the sample, we had to include girls who had graduated from JHS in July 2007 (that is, one year prior to the rest of the sample) and had gained admission into an SHS but had not enrolled.\r\nIn November and December 2009, we conducted a baseline with the 2,246 students deemed eligible. In early January, 2009, the entire sample was called back to assess whether the student had enrolled or intended to enroll in an SHS for the second term of the 2008-2009 school year. A total of 182 students who had or intended to enroll in SHS were dropped from the sample prior to randomization. The initial study sample is thus composed of 2,064 individuals (1,028 males and 1,036 females; among the females, 746 had taken the BECE in 2008 and 290 had taken it in 2007).\r\nAt the time of the follow-up (2013), 14 students had been identified as deceased. The 2013 study sample is thus composed of 2,050 individuals, of which 1,984 were successfully surveyed.\r\n"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In-person interviews at the respondent's residence"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Stata dataset for baseline data.","label":"dta_GSEP_2008baseline.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":75392,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2690493,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/MXO9CO","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/MXO9CO","filename":"dta_GSEP_2008baseline.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":3529264,"description":"Stata dataset for baseline data.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14e48883180-01d78a0b8e26","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","originalFileSize":4396921,"UNF":"UNF:6:je+WoAYvOcbBwqnKU5kDWA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"8e47bda8ba00a8580458ecab9fccb8ac","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"8e47bda8ba00a8580458ecab9fccb8ac"}}},{"description":"Stata dataset for follow-up data.","label":"dta_GSEP_2013followup.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":75392,"categories":["Data"],"dataFile":{"id":2690492,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/2FUG0X","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/2FUG0X","filename":"dta_GSEP_2013followup.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":18724469,"description":"Stata dataset for follow-up data.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14e488975fb-87d8cf42011b","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","originalFileSize":13653746,"UNF":"UNF:6:psFtZ2bNWMg4Lucoln8/tA==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"dde59e32a76a4f8c4670fc7e1473ec83","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"dde59e32a76a4f8c4670fc7e1473ec83"}}},{"description":"Excel codebook for baseline data.","label":"GSEP_2008baseline_codebook.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":75392,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":2690494,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/5YLTQY","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/5YLTQY","filename":"GSEP_2008baseline_codebook.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":239616,"description":"Excel codebook for baseline data.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14e48871ecf-69ea215e9c96","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"055915bdaf2025fa5ad7110e77420308","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"055915bdaf2025fa5ad7110e77420308"}}},{"description":"Excel codebook for follow-up data.","label":"GSEP_2013followup_codebook.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":75392,"categories":["Documentation"],"dataFile":{"id":2690495,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/F2TIVN","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CHNG59/F2TIVN","filename":"GSEP_2013followup_codebook.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":328972,"description":"Excel codebook for follow-up data.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14e488734e2-455b70ea6d4c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"07dfbbb06ed7ab288a822dcbb8e59e77","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"07dfbbb06ed7ab288a822dcbb8e59e77"}}}]}}}
