The types of homicide examined were gang-related,  instrumental, family-related expressive, known person expressive,  stranger expressive, and other. The study asked (1) How do the  socio-economic and demographic characteristics in an area affect the  number of homicides that a community can expect to experience? (2) To  what extent are these links specific to homicide type? and (3) Does the  strength of these links depend on whether the census tract or neighborhood cluster is the geographic unit used in the analysis?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Homicide counts for Chicago's 865 census tracts for  1989-1991 were obtained from HOMICIDES IN CHICAGO, 1965-1995 (ICPSR  6399), Part 1: Victim Level Data. The homicides were originally  classified into ten categories: gang-related, sexual assault,  instrumental, spousal attack, child abuse, other family expressive,  other known expressive, stranger expressive, other, and mystery. For the  purposes of this study the sexual assault, child abuse, and other family  expressive were collapsed into a family-related expressive category and  homicides classified as sexual assault or mystery were added to the  category called other. Demographic and socioeconomic data at the census  tract level were obtained from the Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB)  at the Urban Institute for the year 1990 (or as close as possible to  it). Data in the NCDB are based on information gathered by the United  States Census Bureau in its decennia\nl censuses. Part 1 contains these  data, as initially obtained, at the census tract level. Part 2 contains  these data aggregated up to the neighborhood cluster level. The mapping  of the census tracts to the relevant neighborhood clusters was obtained  from staff at the Project on Human Development in Chicago's  Neighborhoods and was used with their permission. Some census tracts had  missing information for some of the demographic and socioeconomic  variables. This project used simple mean imputations to replace missing  values at the census tract level. Missing values for a variable in a  given census tract were set equal to the mean of non-missing values for  all census tracts in the same neighborhood cluster as the census tract  missing the desired information. This resulted in a sample with no  missing information at the census tract level. As a result, when  aggregating to the neighborhood cluster level, no missing data imputations needed to be performed."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1 contains the following information for each of  Chicago's census tracts: counts of all homicides, gang-related  homicides, instrumental homicides, family homicides, known person  homicides, stranger homicides, other homicides, hispanics as a  percentage of the population, blacks as a percentage of the population,  percent of female-headed households with kids, unemployment rate,  poverty rate, percent of nonfamily households, young males as a  percentage of the population, residential stability, natural log of the  population, and a resource deprivation index.
