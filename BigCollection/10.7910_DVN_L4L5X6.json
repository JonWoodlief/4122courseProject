We find little support for “cultural” hypotheses to the effect that hostility to the West is a mark-up on Muslim and/or Arab identity. We find only limited support for “social” hypotheses that suggest that hostility to the West is predicted by socioeconomic deprivation, youth, and/or being male. We find the strongest support for a lone “political” hypothesis: hostility toward specific Western countries is predicted by those countries' recent and visible international political actions in regard to salient international issues (e.g., Western foreign policies toward Palestine)."}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-09-27"}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Furia.docx","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":68403,"dataFile":{"id":1542036,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Furia.docx","contentType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document","filesize":10087,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:53990","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"72d4229460c5c2c2dfa891a2014f1ace","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"72d4229460c5c2c2dfa891a2014f1ace"}}}]}}}
