Data collected in this study measured the amount of time that people spent doing various activities in 2007, such as paid work, child care, religious activities, volunteering, and socializing. Respondents were interviewed only once about how they spent their time on the previous day, where they were, and whom they were with. The Eating and Health (EH) module includes questions related to eating, meal preparation, and health, all of which were asked after completion of the ATUS questions. Part 1, Respondent and Activity Summary File, contains demographic information about respondents and a summary of the total amount of time they spent doing each activity that day. Part 2, Roster File, contains information about household members and nonhousehold children under the age of 18. Part 3, Activity File, includes additional information on act\nivities in which respondents participated, including the location of each activity and the total time spent on secondary child care. Part 4, Who File, includes data on who was present during each activity. Part 5, ATUS-CPS 2007 File, contains data on respondents and members of their household collected during their participation in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Parts 6-9 contain supplemental data files that can be used for further analysis of the data. Part 6, Case History File, contains information about the interview process. Part 7, Call History File, gives information about each call attempt. Part 8, Trips File, provides information about the number, duration, and purpose of overnight trips away from home for two or more nights in a row in a given reference month. Part 9, ATUS 2007 Replicate Weights File, contains base weights, replicate base weights, and replicate final weights for each case that was selected to be interviewed for the ATUS. Parts 10, 11, 12, and 13 correspond to the 2007 Eating and Health Module.
