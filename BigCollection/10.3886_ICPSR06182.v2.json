Respondents were asked whether the Clinton Administration should take a hard line concerning the trade imbalance with Japan, whether the Administration should pay more attention to Japan than to other Asian countries, whether Japan should become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and whether the United States and Japan should try to increase their financial/technical aid, political influence, and military presence in Asian and Pacific nations. Additional questions covered the current status and future of relations between the United States and Japan, Japan's reliability as an ally, whether Japan's economic strength posed a threat to the United States, and whether things were going in the right direction in each respective country. On othe\nr subjects, respondents offered their opinions on Bill Clinton, the United States economy, the general role of the United States in world affairs, the relative importance of the United States' building unified support in the United Nations before making a major foreign policy decision, and the promotion of Hawaiian sumo wrestler Akebono to Grand Champion.
