Several state-level explanations, ranging from low state capacity to blame evasion for human rights violations have been proposed for the establishment of PGM linkages. These explanations lack focus on the individuals making decisions to form PGMs: national leaders. It is argued that leaders create linkages with PGMs to facilitate leaders’ political survival in the event of their deposition. Threats to leaders’ survival come from the military, foreign powers, or domestic actors outside the ruling coalition. As costs of leader deposition are low for the state, leaders facing threats from one or all of these sources must invest in protection from outside of the security apparatus. The argument is tested through data on PGM linkage formation and threats to political survival. Results show that leaders under coup threat are more likely to form PGM linkages, while threats from foreign actors make leaders particularly more likely to form linkages with ethnic or religious PGMs. The findings strongly suggest that PGM linkage formation is driven by leader-level desire for political survival, rather than a host of state-level explanations.\r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Interactions, International"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-05-10"}]}},"files":[{"label":"master_pgm_ii.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":136848,"dataFile":{"id":3152375,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/SXLX9F","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/SXLX9F","filename":"master_pgm_ii.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":988861,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1634b06ed2d-8e020aeff8cb","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","originalFileSize":1319494,"UNF":"UNF:6:ENIfxpe9xPe1nKM6YoOD5w==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"a6da0d2b98884fd3fa2a994e9650b491","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"a6da0d2b98884fd3fa2a994e9650b491"}}},{"label":"replication_codebook.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136848,"dataFile":{"id":3152376,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/AIGDXD","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/AIGDXD","filename":"replication_codebook.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":115001,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1634b06e74b-6441d163d07c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"4a40001c533d7674b291f0c50055e4e6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"4a40001c533d7674b291f0c50055e4e6"}}},{"label":"replication_pgm_kash_ii.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136848,"dataFile":{"id":3152378,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/4V02UG","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/4V02UG","filename":"replication_pgm_kash_ii.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":20912,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1634b06e5ab-c90d7efff826","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7c7db63d99c34cf5e4d844b3a1558d88","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7c7db63d99c34cf5e4d844b3a1558d88"}}},{"label":"replication_pgm_kash_ii.R","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":136848,"dataFile":{"id":3152377,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/TUE1FP","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KJVJUW/TUE1FP","filename":"replication_pgm_kash_ii.R","contentType":"type/x-r-syntax","filesize":2288,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1634b06e9d0-84bec0b45805","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"dd2076026f31f297b405a74643bb0006","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"dd2076026f31f297b405a74643bb0006"}}}]}}}
