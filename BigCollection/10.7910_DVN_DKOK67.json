There was no significant difference in the mean femoral component coronal alignment between knees with VCA<5° (p=0.28), knees with VCA 5°-7° (p=0.48) and knees with >7° (p=0.09). No significant difference was noted in the mean femoral component coronal alignment between knees with varus deformity <10° (p=0.19), varus deformity 10°-20° (p=0.72) and valgus deformity (p=0.35).\r\nConclusions: Using the enhanced conventional technique in each patient to perform distal femoral cut during total knee arthroplasty can help achieve the coronal alignment of the femoral component comparable to navigation technique."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Medicine, Health and Life Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"distal femur, total knee arthroplasty, valgus cut, computer navigated arthroplasty, alignment, conventional knee arthroplasty"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Singh, Rohan"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-02-26"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Final NAVIGATED_Vs_NON-NAVIGATED.xls","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":150613,"dataFile":{"id":3371598,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Final NAVIGATED_Vs_NON-NAVIGATED.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":82432,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1692a5c488f-e9b02fcabb8c","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"7a2e61c71e44ed2038a4eb86f017d5ec","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"7a2e61c71e44ed2038a4eb86f017d5ec"}}}]}}}
