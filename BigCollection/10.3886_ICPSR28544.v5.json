The yearly N-SSATS data collected from 1997 to 2009 were collected under the Office of Applied Studies. In 2010 data began to be collected under the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Data were collected by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., Princeton, NJ, and prepared for release by Synectics for Management Decisions, Inc., Arlington, VA.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: N-SSATS collects data about facilities, not individual clients. Data on clients represent an aggregate of clients in treatment for each reporting facility.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: N-SSATS attempts to obtain responses from all known facilities that provide substance abuse treatment, but it is a voluntary survey. There is no adjustment for facility nonresponse.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: This is a concatenated file of the individual N-SSATS files. The 2008 survey was selected as the \"base\" year. The concatenated file includes equivalent variables from prior years. If an equivalent variable (i.e., with similar question wording) was not part of an earlier survey, the variable was constructed from the existing questions where possible. If an equivalent variable did not exist or could not be constructed, variables expressing a similar concept or topic were included.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The question text for most variables is based on the 2008 questionnaire. The question text for variables that have no equivalent in the 2008 survey was taken from the most recent questionnaire that included the variable. As question wording and definitions may vary slightly from year to year, the individual questionnaires should be consulted in any analysis.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: General topics and data items that were discontinued before the 2008 survey are not included in the concatenated data set. The majority of these discontinuations occurred at the time of the major survey redesign prior to the 2000 survey. Discontinued data items were those where data reported was found to be unreliable and include facility revenue, percent of population representing specific groups, unduplicated client counts, wait list information, managed care ownership, and parent/affiliate relationships. Please see Table 4 of the PDF codebook for a crosswalk of the variables included in each survey year.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The concatenated file includes the facilities in the N-SSATS Annual Reports and public use files. Rules for the inclusion of facilities in the data file vary slightly. In 1997 only, facilities treating only DUI/DWI clients were inelgible to complete the survey. From 2000 on, non-state approved solo practitioners, and faciliti\nes where all clients were incarcerated were excluded.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: In 1997, 1998, and 2000 the survey reference date was October 1. The reference date was changed to the last business day in March beginning with the 2002 survey. This change was made to help increase the timeliness of responses by facilities. As a result, no data were collected for 2001.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: In 2002, a Web option for survey response was introduced and used by 20 percent of responding facilities. By 2010, this had increased to 61 percent.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), rda Data file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-06-01"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-03-31"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011-10-24"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["survey data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) Series"}}}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]},{"typeName":"geographicUnit","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA)"]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"unitOfAnalysis","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["facility"]},{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["<p>This concatenated file includes 173,590 records representing 31,477 individual treatment facilities.
