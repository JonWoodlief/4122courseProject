The study was conducted in part to assess respondents' interest in and opinions about the 2002 elections in the state of New York. Residents of that state were asked to give their opinions of Governor George Pataki and his handling of the governorship, the economy of New York, Pataki's response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, and his participation in the recovery efforts following the terrorist attacks. Also elicited were views of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer, state comptroller H. Carl McCall, and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Those queried were asked whether they intended to vote in the November 5, 2002, elections. Respondents were also asked for whom they would vote if the election for governor were held that day, given a choice between George Pataki (Republican Party), H. Carl McCall (Democratic Party), and Tom Golisano (Independent Party). Respondents were also asked which candidate cared more about the needs of residents of New York City, residents of the suburbs, residents of upstate New York, and of people like the respondent. Those queried were asked to specify which candidate was more likely to raise taxes, improve the state of the New York economy, help all the people of New York, and help only special interest groups. Respondents were also asked if Pataki and McCall were spending more time during the campaign attacking each other or explaining what they would do if elected. Respondents were asked to consider whether Pataki had made progress in the following areas during his eight years in office: improving public school education, reducing New York State's taxes, improving the state's economy, creating jobs in New York State, protecting the environment, and reducing the state's debt. They were asked for whom they would vote if the election for state comptroller were held that day, given a choice between John Faso (Republican Party) and Alan Hevesi (Democratic Party). Likely voters were asked whether a candidate's stance on keeping open the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant, located in Westchester, New York, would influence their vote. Additional questions probed respondents' views on the Rockefeller laws requiring mandatory sentences for drug offenses, environmental protection, the quality of New York State public schools, the influence of Blacks and Catholics in how the state of New York was run, whether employees who worked in New York City and lived elsewhere should be charged a commuter tax, whether state financial aid to New York City was adequate, and the preferred solution to the state's budget concerns. Those queried were asked for their views on Bloomberg's tenure as mayor, specifically his record on crime compared to tha\nt of his predecessor Rudolph Giuliani. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, education, religion, marital status, Hispanic descent, race, years in community, household income, and whether they watched or listened to the October 13 gubernatorial debate."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"candidates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"governors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mayors"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political campaigns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public officials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public schools"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"September 11 attack"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social issues"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"state government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"taxes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
