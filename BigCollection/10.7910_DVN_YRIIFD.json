Meta-data regarding cotemporaneous efficiency-related projects at EcoHouse, among other circumstances, is presented in the analysis.\nGiven the data from fiscal years 2005-2009, it is estimated that EcoHouse has reduced its monthly electricity consumption by 2.5%, and monthly natural gas consumption by 56.3%."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-06-01"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-06-01"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2010-06-01"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2004-05"},"timePeriodCoveredEnd":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-06"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2004-05"},"dateOfCollectionEnd":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionEnd","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-06"}}]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"United States"}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"1128 and 1130 East St, Grinnell, IA 50112"}}]}]}},"files":[{"description":"This document includes the raw data relating to electricity and natural gas consumption at both 1128 East (Pine Tree House) and 1130 East (EcoHouse), as well as the utility costs, and the ratio of consumption between the two houses.","label":"EcoHouse v.
