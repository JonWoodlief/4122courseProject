The revised  curriculum was designed to provide a range of supportive concepts and  skills, including teaching officers how to develop positive  police-community relations and the ways in which community policing  techniques are helpful in dealing with crime. The curriculum also  placed substantial emphasis on enhancing individuals' sensitivity to  and awareness of cultural and ethnic differences. This study aimed to:  (1) evaluate the extent to which the academy's basic training program  produced desired changes in officers' attitudes and beliefs related to  community policing, problem-oriented policing, and police-citizen  interactions, (2) track a panel of academy graduates through the first  year of their police careers in their respective police agencies to  evaluate the effects of field training, occupational socialization,  community policing, and different work environments (e.g., department  size and constituencies with different needs and demands) on officers'  attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to traditional policing,  community policing, and police-citizen interactions, and (3) track  academy dropouts and determine if and how their attitudes and values differed systematically from non-dropouts."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A multiple-treatment single-case design was used  to study 446 police recruits from 14 successive academy classes that  began basic training classes at the Phoenix Regional Training Academy  between December 1995 and October 1996.

The first administration (pretest) of the  survey took place on police recruits' first day at the academy.  Training academy administrators provided researchers with one hour of  class time during which the survey was administered and collected  immediately upon completion. A 16-week lag existed between the pretest  (time one) and the first post-test (time two), which was conducted  during the final three days of the basic training academy. The second  post-test (time three) occurred 12 weeks after the first post-test,  between June 1996 and March 1997, at or near the end of the recruits'  field training process.
