A total of 67 resources (representing 59 studies,  including 9 focusing on individuals with disabilities) met the  inclusion criteria and were included in the data abstraction process.  In order to be included in the review, the article had to be an  English-language publication published between 1990 and June 2003 of a  SAPI evaluation that had appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, book  chapter, or government report (dissertations were excluded), and the  evaluated program had to be a primary or secondary preventive  intervention targeting adolescents or older that included outcome  measures and a pre-test/post-test or between-group differences  design. To find articles, the researchers performed keyword searches  in several relevant electronic databases to describe the sexual  offender, sexual offense, victim, intervention and prevention  programs, and evaluation and program effectiveness. Key search terms  specific to three groups (special populations/individuals with  disabilities, minorities, and adolescents) were used to ensure  inclusion of publications about these groups. A three-tiered review  process was employed to abstract data from the articles and ensure a  thorough assessment. Two reviewers from the RTI team separately  recorded detailed information for each article, and any discrepancies  were reconciled by a third reviewer. All three reviewers independently  assessed study quality. Two standardized forms, one for data  abstraction and one for quality rating, were used to review each  article. The data abstraction form, which was used to classify  information from each article, included sections for descriptive  information about the population and setting, study design and sample,  and the preventive intervention. The form also included sections for  recording study measures and instruments. The final section included  space to indicate the quality score (from the quality rating form) and  the major strengths and weaknesses of both the study and the article.  Each article was given three quality rating scores: one to assess the  study description, one to assess the study design, and a total score  (the sum of the study description and study design scores). The total  score was then divided by the number of possible points to determine the percentage score."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The data abstraction form, which was used to  classify information from each article, included sections for  descriptive information about the population and setting, study design  and sample, and the pr\neventive intervention.
