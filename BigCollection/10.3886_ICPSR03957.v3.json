The replicate weights were created by the jackknife method and the user must specify the JKN variance estimation procedure when using Wesvar PC. Note on the JKN and FPC factors required for JKN variance estimation: In order for the JKN procedure to work correctly, it is necessary to attach two files of factors to the Wesvar file. These are the FPC and JKN factors. Both files are included under this study, named da395\n7.p2 and da3957.p3. Users should download both files, change the file name of da3957.p2 to fpc.txt and da3957.p3 to jknfact.dat, and attach both files to the Wesvar data file. In addition, the degrees of freedom should be set at 81 in Wesvar (100 replicate weights -- 19 varstrat units) in order to calculate the correct confidence intervals.; Subject: null  Type: null  Notes: Stata system file(s), sav Data file(s), stc Data file(s), tsv Data file(s), Data file(s), and electronic documentation.;"},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan"},"distributorAbbreviation":{"typeName":"distributorAbbreviation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/images/icpsr-logo.gif"}}]},{"typeName":"distributionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2004-05-28"},{"typeName":"timePeriodCovered","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"timePeriodCoveredStart":{"typeName":"timePeriodCoveredStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2001"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfCollection","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"dateOfCollectionStart":{"typeName":"dateOfCollectionStart","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2002"}}]},{"typeName":"kindOfData","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["event/transaction data"]},{"typeName":"series","multiple":false,"typeClass":"compound","value":{"seriesName":{"typeName":"seriesName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Civil Justice Survey of State Courts: [United States] Series"}}},{"typeName":"dataSources","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["standard coding forms completed by court staff"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Please see geographic coverage."}},{"otherGeographicCoverage":{"typeName":"otherGeographicCoverage","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"}}]}]},"socialscience":{"displayName":"Social Science and Humanities Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"universe","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Tort, contract, and real property cases in the 75 most populous counties in the United States."]},{"typeName":"samplingProcedure","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"A two-stage stratified sample was drawn, with 46 of the 75  most populous counties selected at the first stage.
