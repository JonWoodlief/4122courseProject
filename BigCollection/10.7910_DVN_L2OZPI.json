Abstract: What citizens think about Muslim immigrants is of great importance for some of the most pressing challenges facing Western democracies. To advance our understanding of what “Islamophobia” really is – i.e. whether it is a dislike based on immigrants` ethnic background, their religious identity or their specific religious behaviour – we fielded a representative online survey experiment in the UK in the summer 2015. Our results suggest that Muslims are not per se viewed more negatively than Christian immigrants. Instead, we provide evidence that citizens’ uneasiness with Muslim immigration is first and foremost the result of a rejection of fundamentalist forms of religiosity. This suggests that com-mon explanations, which are based on simple dichotomies between liberal supporters and conservative critics of immigration need to be re-evaluated. While the politically left and culturally liberal have more positive attitudes towards immigrants than right leaning and conservatives, they are also far more critical towards religious groups. We conclude that a large part of the current political controver-sy over Muslim immigration has to do with this double opposition. Importantly, the current political conflict over Muslim immigration is not so much about immigrants versus natives or even Muslim versus Christians as it is about political liberalism versus religious fundamentalism."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Traunmueller, Richard"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-01-11"}]}},"files":[{"description":"R code to reproduce analyses and figures","label":"what_is_islamophobia_replication.R","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":132201,"dataFile":{"id":3102076,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/L2OZPI/RPUS8N","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/L2OZPI/RPUS8N","filename":"what_is_islamophobia_replication.R","contentType":"type/x-r-syntax","filesize":30907,"description":"R code to reproduce analyses and figures","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:160e58dbd39-22fccad4003e","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"697174795f64825c76aaff63c934b3ee","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"697174795f64825c76aaff63c934b3ee"}}},{"description":"Replication data set (STATA format)","label":"what_is_islamophobia_replication.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":132201,"dataFile":{"id":3102077,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/L2OZPI/PRZHWC","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/L2OZPI/PRZHWC","filename":"what_is_islamophobia_replication.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":565513,"description":"Replication data set (STATA format)","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:160e58d42cb-300d217ee49c","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","originalFileSize":1228398,"UNF":"UNF:6:mG1G8jxWknlFz9Xs1EPisg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"310a3114cdf01443b3bee199de4333db","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"310a3114cdf01443b3bee199de4333db"}}}]}}}
