The catchment area for Omaha was the central city. The data for this research were collected in conjunction with the National Institute of Justice's Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) program. At the time of this study's release, the ADAM program was operational in approximately 35 cities nationwide, providing national and local profiles of drug use within arrestee populations and the monitoring of drug use patterns. An extension and refinement of the previous Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program (see DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES 1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]), the ADAM program (see ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE MONITORING (ADAM) PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 1998 [ICPSR 2826], 1999 [ICPSR 2994], 2000 [ICPSR 3270], 2001 [ICPSR 3688], 2002 [ICPSR 3815], and 2003 [ICPSR 4020]) is the United States government's primary source of information on drug use among arrestees, and is one of the primary research tools on drug use, crime, and other social indicators. Quarterly interviews with arrestees selected using probability based sampling (for males) and convenience\nsampling (for females) were conducted in jails and detention facilities at each ADAM site. Urine samples were also collected and tested for a core panel of drugs that included cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, and opiates. Because the drug screen could not detect drugs beyond 72 hours after use, only arrestees who had been incarcerated 48 hours or fewer were eligible for participation. The ADAM interview provided demographic and descriptive data, including race, age, marital status, source of income, screens for substance abuse and dependency, treatment history, arrest and incarceration experiences, and participation in local drug markets. At the conclusion of the interview, respondents were asked to provide a urine specimen. The data were collected in October and November of 1998 using a convenience sample.

Jail staff could also page interviewers when new arrestees arrived using a digital pager. In Hall (n=53) and Scotts Bluff (n=149) counties, jail staff preferred to use a specific time period in the evening to collect information from any new arrestees booked in the previous 24 hours. In Omaha (n=202), data were collected for t\nwo weeks during structured time intervals in morning and evening.
