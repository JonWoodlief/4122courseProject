This paper systematically reviews 51 studies on conditions, strategies, and implications of cross-boundary entrepreneurship. Findings show that (1) the literature predominantly mentions issue promotion and coalition-building as cross-boundary strategies; (2) vertical boundary-crossing is discussed more frequently than horizontal boundary-crossing; (3) the most reported boundary-crossing function is to expand issue arenas; (4) conditions that enable cross-boundary strategies include institutional overlap, issue interpretation, power vacuum, overruling policies, lacking resources; and (5) implications of entrepreneurship include raised opposition, increased competition over leadership, augmented complexity hindering collective action, raised costs and resources, and issues regarding trust, legitimacy, and authority. Policy entrepreneurship allows for micro-level insights in the emergence of cross-boundary processes. We suggest future research to focus on causal processes between conditions, strategies, and implications to better understand their interplay."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-11-21"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policy entrepreneurship, strategy, boundary-crossing"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Faling, Marijn"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-11-21"}]}},"files":[{"description":"this file contains the numerical description of strategies, functions, and directions","label":"entrepreneurship strategies.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":130781,"dataFile":{"id":3081001,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/M8NGVF/YYYCII","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/M8NGVF/YYYCII","filename":"entrepreneurship strategies.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":6168,"description":"this file contains the numerical description of strategies, functions, and directions","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15fde04e2fc-5fe345ced66c","originalFileFormat":"application/x-spss-sav","originalFormatLabel":"SPSS SAV","UNF":"UNF:6:1YWi/eGWTmfmOH3CCJcH6A==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b038200496091eeb7837164a7d2b0a48","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b038200496091eeb7837164a7d2b0a48"}}}]}}}
