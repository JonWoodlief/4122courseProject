Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way that Barack Obama was handling his job as president, the economy, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, health care, and the threat of terrorism. Information was collected on whether respondents approved of the way Congress was handling its job, how they rated the condition of the national economy, whether they approved of and understood the new health care reform bill, whether they thought that the health care reform bill would personally effect them, whether health care reform would improve the quality of health care, whether it would increase the federal budget deficit, and whether they thought that the new health insurance reforms would increase consumer protection against health insurance companies. Respondents were also asked whether they thought that members of Congress and Americans today had more civility in debating the issues than they did ten years ago, whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the Tea Party movement, Sarah Palin, and Pope Benedict. Respondents were queried on whether they thought that the Pope and the Vatican did a good job or poor job in handling the charges of sexual abuse of children by priests, whether they thought that international terrorism or domestic terrorism was a more serious threat to Americans, whether they were going to participate in the 2010 Census,  whether they felt they paid their fair share of taxes, and whether they filed their 2009 income taxes. Respondents were asked whether they thought the condition of the environment for the next generation would be better, worse, or about the same as it was, how much they have heard about the iPad, whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Steve Job\ns, whether they thought that marijuana should be legal, whether they would go into space if offered a free trip, and which news source they considered to be the most trustworthy. Finally, respondents were asked how concerned they were that they or someone in their household might be out of work in the next 12 months, whether they were a supporter of the Tea Party movement, whether they had some form of health insurance, and how often they attended religious services. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, marital status, education level, household income, religious preference, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), political party affiliation, political philosophy, and voter registration
