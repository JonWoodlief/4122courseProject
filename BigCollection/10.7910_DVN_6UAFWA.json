In contrast, Fajnzylber, Lederman & Loayza provide seemingly strong and robust evidence\r\nthat inequality causes a higher rate of both homicide and robbery/violent theft, even after controlling\r\nfor country-specific fixed effects. The results in the present article suggest that inequality is not a statistically\r\nsignificant determinant, unless either country-specific effects are not controlled for or the sample\r\nis artificially restricted to a small number of countries. The reason for the link between inequality and\r\nviolent property crime being spurious is that income inequality is likely to be strongly correlated with\r\ncountry-specific fixed effects, such as cultural differences. A high degree of inequality might be socially\r\nundesirable for any number of reasons, but that it causes violent crime is far from proven."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-04-19"}]}},"files":[{"label":"JPR robbery.do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":125661,"dataFile":{"id":3013492,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6UAFWA/7B0BH7","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6UAFWA/7B0BH7","filename":"JPR robbery.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":7712,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15b86348385-31534d9d3c36","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"6bef457f56923c4afa0d6742239723f6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"6bef457f56923c4afa0d6742239723f6"}}},{"label":"JPR robbery.tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":125661,"dataFile":{"id":3013493,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/6UAFWA/4QBICL","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6UAFWA/4QBICL","filename":"JPR robbery.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":119124,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15b86347e9a-a02e0cbb91d7","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:rpF3j3WNQb8t6l04SY5wsg==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b61d506ddab14847a5f4d4ced4d02089","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b61d506ddab14847a5f4d4ced4d02089"}}}]}}}
