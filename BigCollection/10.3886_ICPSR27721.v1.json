The NICHD protocol (Orbach et al., 2000) was developed to translate experimentally based professional recommendations regarding interviewing strategies into operational guidelines. The NICHD protocol trains interviewers to use open-ended prompts and techniques and guides them through all phases of the investigative interview to maximize the amount of information elicited from free recall memory. The protocol strategies and techniques were developed in accordance with widespread evidence that free recall memory prompts are likely to elicit accurate information, whereas prompts that depend on recognition processes are associated with more erroneous responses. Specifically, the purpose of the study was to assess the effects of the NICHD protocol on decisions made regarding whether to arrest and charge a suspect, to submit a case for prosecution and to carry a case forward to the justice system, to assess the suspicion of abuse as unfounded or as lacking sufficient evidence to proceed with the filing of charges, and during the judicial process when charged cases reached court disposition, to proceed through either plea agreement or trial."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The researchers coded information from child protection and police reports, Children's Justice Center (CJC) intake forms, and the CJC electronic database to create a dataset on 1,280 alleged child sexual abuse cases involving children interviewed in Salt Lake Co\nunty, Utah, between 1994 and 2000.
