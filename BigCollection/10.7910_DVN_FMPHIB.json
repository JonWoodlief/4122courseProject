The most critical scrutiny of EI came from those scholars who directly questioned the model assumptions of EI and the consequences of violations of these assumptions. More recently, the EI’s extended model, rather than its basic model, has been suggested as the best hope to save EI from the trouble of violations of model assumptions, especially logical inconsistency. This paper takes advantage of a unique opportunity to compare the controversial methods, including survey approach, by using aggregate as well as individual level data from an actual election. Furthermore, the true quantities of interest are also available, which guarantees the accuracy of the empirical tests. Our results show that EI basic model provided a better estimate for the black turnout rate, but not for the white turnout, than did the traditional Goodman and double regression methods. However, using an appropriate covariate in the EI extended model can drastically improve the estimation accuracy."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ecological inference, EI extended model, ecological fallacy"}}]},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2009-07-29"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Comment on “EI extended model and the fear of ecological fallacy”, by Baodong Liu by Jeffrey S.
