The following criteria were used for the inclusion of studies in the systematic review: the study described an evaluation of a program designed specifically to reduce school (kindergarten to high school) bullying; bullying was defined as including: physical, verbal, or psychological attack or intimidation that is intended to cause fear, distress, or harm to the victim; and an imbalance of power, with the more powerful child (or children) oppressing less powerful ones; bullying (specifically) was measured using self-report questionnaires, peer ratings, teacher ratings, or observational data; the effectiveness of the program was measured by comparing students who received it (the experimental condition) with a comparison group of students who did not receive it (the control condition). There must have been some control of extraneous variables in the evaluation by (1) randomization, or (2) pre-test measures of bulling, or (3) choosing some kind of comparable control condition; published and unpublished reports of research conducted in developed countries between 1983 and 2009 were included; and it was possible to measure the effect size. Several search strategies were used to identify 89 anti-bully studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in this review: researchers searched for the names of established researchers in the area of bullying prevention; researchers conducted a keyword search of 18 electronic databases; researchers conducted a manual search of 35 journals, either online or in print, from 1983 until the end of May 2009; and researchers sought information from key researchers on bullying and from international colleagues in the Campbell Collaboration.

The unmodified Original Bully Data (Part 11) and Original Victim Data (Part 12) are available in Microsoft Excel format. ICPSR also created a tab-delimited version of the original Part 11 and Part 12 data for preservation purposes. Given the structure of the original data files, ICPSR converted the Original Bully Data into four parts and converted the Original Victim Data into five parts. Parts 1-4 represent transposed versions of the Original Bully Data in SPSS, SAS, and Stata formats and Parts 5-9 represent transposed versions of the Original Victim Data in SPSS, SAS, and Stata formats.
