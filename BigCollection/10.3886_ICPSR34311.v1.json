As of December 2011, New Connections has supported the career development of 100 grantees: junior researchers and mid-career professionals from historically disadvantaged and underrepresented communities. In addition, the program has provided overall support to a larger network of over 1,200 scholars from these same communities. This study comprises data from three surveys that were conducted as part of the evaluation of New Connections: the Grantee Process Survey, Grantee Network Survey, and Larger Network Survey.</p>\n\n<p>The Grantee Process Survey interviewed New Connections grantees about their accomplishments and participation in professional activities, confidence in various abilities before and after they became grantees, satisfaction with support from New Connections, the extent to which New Connections improved their knowledge and skills, and the extent to which they agreed or disagreed that the program affected their ability to obtain their current position or made them more influential in their work settings.</p>\n\n<p>The Grantee Network Survey questioned New Connections grantees about the persons from whom they would seek support, guidance, or information; expertise; work with; or communicate with about what they needed to be successful in their current positions and to advance in their careers (e.g., to get tenure, a promotion, or a leadership position).</p>\n\n<p>The Larger Network Survey interviewed members of the larger network about their participation in New Connections activities, their interactions with New Connections grantees and the larger network, the extent to which the program improved their knowledge and skills, the extent to which they agreed or disagreed that New Connections affected their ability to obtain their current position, and their satisfaction with the program.</p>\n\n<p>There is a separate data file for each survey. Together with the survey responses, all three files include information from the program's administrative records, such as the highest degree earned, institution type, field of work, race and Hispanic ethnicity, first generation college student status, and low income status. In addition, the Grantee Process Survey data file contains variables derived from the respondents' curriculum vitae that show the number of grantee presentations and publications before, during, and after the New Connection grants.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"academic careers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cultural diversity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foundations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"grants"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"historically underrepresented minorities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"leadership"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"philanthropy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA V.
