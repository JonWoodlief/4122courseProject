Respondents were asked to give their views on President Bill  Clinton and his handling of the economy and foreign policy, the United  States Congress, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore,  former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, Texas governor George W. Bush,  Arizona senator John McCain, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative  commentator Pat Buchanan, Family Research Council president Gary  Bauer, talk show host Alan Keyes, Utah senator Orrin Hatch,  businessman Donald Trump, and the Republican and Democratic political  parties. A series of questions addressed the upcoming 2000  presidential race. Topics centered on how much attention respondents  had paid to the campaign, whether they intended to vote in a primary  or caucus, and whom they expected to win the presidential  election. Respondents were asked for whom they would vote in a\nDemocratic primary or caucus, given a choice between Gore and Bradley,  and for whom they would vote in a Republican primary or caucus, given  a choice among Bush, Buchanan, Forbes, McCain, Keyes, and Hatch. Their  views were also sought on a planned Reform Party primary with the  following contenders: Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura, actor Warren  Beatty, Buchanan, Trump, and Reform Party founder Ross  Perot. Respondents were given several presidential match-ups and asked  for whom they would vote in each scenario. Those queried were also  asked which political party they felt was best equipped to make  decisions regarding the economy, Social Security, the environment,  Medicare, the tax system, the military, the federal budget, health  care, education, and family values. Additional topics covered  respondents' views on abortion, the correlation between a political  candidate's stance on abortion and the likelihood of the respondent  voting for that candidate, the role of the Reform Party in United  States politics, and respondents' interest level in professional  sports. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race,  Hispanic descent, political party, political orientation, voter  registration and participation history, education, religion, marital status, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
