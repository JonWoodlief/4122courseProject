The NATIONAL SURVEY OF ADOLESCENTS IN THE UNITED  STATES, 1995 (ICPSR 2833) consisted of a national probability  telephone sample of 4,023 juveniles between the ages of 12-17 who (1)  were living in United States households with telephones, (2) resided  with a parent or guardian, and (3) could converse in English or  Spanish. All sample selection and interviewing was done by Schulman,  Ronca, and Bucuvalas, Inc. (SRBI), a New York-based survey research  team. All interviews with both parents and adolescents were conducted  using Computer- Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology.  After determining that the household contained one or more eligible  adolescents, interviewers asked to speak to a parent or guardian. One  parent or guardian in each household was interviewed briefly to  establish rapport, s\necure permission to interview the targeted  adolescent, and to ensure the collection of comparative data to  examine potential nonresponse bias from households without adolescent  participation. Parents and guardians were provided the opportunity to  call a toll-free number to confirm the authenticity of the study.  Whenever possible, adolescents were interviewed immediately following  the parent or guardian interviews. Otherwise, appointments were  scheduled when possible or blind callbacks at different times of the  day or days of the week were made. As an incentive for participation,  adolescent participants received a certificate of participation in the  \"National Survey of Adolescents\" and a check for five dollars as  compensation for their time.

Because the parent or guardian interviews  were conducted prior to the adolescent interviews, the 4,023  participants in the parent sample were also selected from a national  probability sample of households and a probability oversample of  central city households. To construct the initial national probability  sample, a multistage, stratified, area probability, random-digit-  dialing sampling procedure that had four steps was used. Fi\nrst, the  United States was stratified geographically by Census region and a  population-based subsample allocation was developed for each  geographic stratum. In other words, the number of households drawn for  the sample from each geographic stratum was allocated in proportion to  the actual distribution of the population residing within each  stratum, according to the most recent Census estimates. In the second  step, telephone banks within each geographic stratum were  systematically selected utilizing the comprehensive database of  working telephone banks maintained by Schulman, Ronca, and Bucuvalas,  Inc. (SRBI). Third, random-digit-dialing was used to sample telephone  households within the telephone banks selected in the second  stage. Nonworking household (e.g., business) numbers were immediately  replaced by other numbers selected in the same fashion as the initial  numbers. Non-answering numbers were called again four times before  being replaced. In the fourth step, an adult respondent in each  household was screened to determine if there were any adolescents aged  12-17 currently living in the household or if any had lived in the  household at least four months during the previous year. In households  with multiple eligible adolescents, a systematic selection (i.e.,  \"most recent birthday\" technique) was made to determine which eligible  individual would be designated as the respondent. Construction of the  central city oversample followed the same procedures except for the  initial geographic stratification step. This step was replaced using  the census classification of counties by types of place and specifying  the target population as households located within these urban  counties. Adolescents who were potentially excluded from the study  included those residing in institutional settings, in households  without a parent or guardian (e.g., emancipated minors, married  adolescents living on their own) or in a house without telephones,  those who did not speak English or Spanish, and those whose parents did not give permission for them to be interviewed."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Parents in 90.1 percent of eligible households  completed interviews and parents in 78.9 percent of eligible  households gave permission for their adolescents to be interviewed.
