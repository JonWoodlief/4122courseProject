But funding data from the Army’s procurement and research and development accounts over six ﬁscal years demonstrate that individual program budget outcomes are often highly volatile and unpredictable, not incremental. The Pentagon’s complex acquisition process, defense industry’s singular focus on proﬁts, and traditional congressional interests in local economic beneﬁts all contribute to volatile program funding and constrain the Army’s efforts to manage and defend its budget request."},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2011"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Harvard University, Department of Government"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Enter your dissertation reference here.
