Variables  include number of arrests for robbery, violent crimes, property  crimes, and other felonies, number of drug arrests, number of  misdemeanor arrests, rate of violent, property, robbery, weapons,  other felony, drug, and misdemeanor arrests, offense type (drug  trafficking, drug possession, robbery, and burglary), total number of  incarcerations, total number of convictions, whether sentenced to  prison, jail, or probation, incarceration sentence in months, sex,  race, and age at sampled conviction, and age at first arrest (starting at age 17)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Since the mid-1980s, the number of drug offenders  handled by local and federal criminal justice systems has grown at  high rates. The rising numbers of drug offenders have contributed  substantially to the total increase in incarceration in the United  States. The objective of this study was to examine the offending  patterns of recent and past drug offenders to assess the crime control  potential associated with recent increases in the incarceration of  drug offenders. Specifically, three comparisons were made: (1)  differences over time, (2) differences by sanction imposed, and (3)  differences among offenders convicted of different offense  types. Assuming an equilibrium in offending rates, the research sought  to identify observable differences in offending among various  samples. The periods of interest focused on the second half of the  1980s, when dramatic shifts toward increasing incarceration of drug  offen\nders first became evident, compared to a later time period after escalating sentences were well under way."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Convicted offenders were the focus of the study,  since these cases are most directly affected by changes in  imprisonment policies, particularly provisions for mandatory prison  terms.
