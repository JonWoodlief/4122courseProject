The project was directed by three sets of  research questions corresponding to these premises: (1) How strongly  is the implementation of community-oriented policing by police  agencies across the U.S. predicted by the organizational structures of  agencies? (2) How strongly do community contextual characteristics  determine or predict the adoption of COP?
