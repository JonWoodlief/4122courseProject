A secondary   objective of the study was to advance the analysis of historical trends   relating to political behavior in France. Accordingly, the   questionnaire closely matches the standard American National Election   Study, and, where appropriate, the questions were posed in language and   forms that maintained continuity with earlier studies conducted in   France. The 132 variables include 7-point scales recording respondents'   left-right positions on major issues (including government subsidies to   religious schools, the size of the public sector, and government policy   toward immigrants) as well as their perceptions of the positions of the   five major parties and the four major presidential candidates on those   same scales. Also included are thermometer scales relating to the   parties and candidates and measures rel\nating to party identification   and strength of party identification, religion and frequency of church   attendance, assessments of the performance of the incumbent, and   perceptions of personal and national economic conditions. Data   concerning subjective class perceptions, union membership, and other   standard demographic characteristics, as well as data relating to   electoral participation and candidate choice at each of the two   ballots, are also included. In addition, the study contains a series of   variables permitting direct comparisons of media attention in France  with that in the United States."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.A.2.b.

On the basis of the 1982 census   figures, and aiming at a target of 1,000 interviews, each stratum (as   well as the Paris region) was assigned a number of interviews   proportional to the population of the stratum. Then, individual   communes were selected by random sampling within each stratum (and the   Paris region) on the assumption that ten interviews would be conducted  in each commune."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"French Presidential Election Survey, 1988","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":36361,"dataFile":{"id":2619528,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"French Presidential Election Survey, 1988","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
