Further objectives were to use the findings to assist in the design of effective intervention methods by sexual assault treatment centers and community education projects, and to present significant findings useful for community policing and other criminal justice initiatives. Survey data for this study were collected from female victims of nonincestuous sexual assault incidents who were at least 14 years of age and sought treatment (within one year of being assaulted) from the Sex Abuse Treatment Center (SATC) in Honolulu, Hawaii, during 1987-1992. Data were collected on two types of victims: (1) immediate treatment seekers, who sought treatment within 72 hours of an assault incident, and (2) delayed treatment seekers, who sought treatment 72 hours or longer after an assault incident. Demographic variables for the victims include age at the time of the assault, marital status, employment status, educational level, and race and ethnicity. Other variables include where the attack took place, the victim's relationship to the assailant, the number of assailants, and whether the assailant(s) used threats, force, or a weapon, or injured or drugged the victim. Additional variables cover whether the victim attempted to get away, resisted physically, yelled, and/or reported the incident to the police, how the victim learned about the Sex Abuse Treatment Center, whether the victim was a tourist, in the military, or a resident of the island, the number of days between the assault and the interview, and a self-reported trauma Sexual Assault Symptom Scale measure."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Victimization surveys of both the general  population and various special populations (e.g., college students and  children) have for many years documented a relatively high incidence  and prevalence of sexual assault. Many victims, however, do not report  sexual assaults to the police. Underreporting of sexual assault to the  police is important because of its negative impact on the potential  apprehension, arrest, and conviction of violent sex offenders. It may  also bias comparisons of sexual assault cases with other criminal  offenses. Although previous research has shown that a number of  variables influence whether a victim reports an abuse incident, such  as the type of sexual assault, the victim's demographic  characteristics, and the level of post-assault trauma, there have been  conflicting findings as to which specific variables within these  dimensions are most important. This study was undertaken to  investigate factors facilitating and hindering a victim's decision to  report a sexual assault to the police. Further objectives were to use  the findings to assist in the design of effective intervention methods  by sexual assault treatment centers and community education projects,  and to present significant findings useful for community policing and other criminal justice initiatives."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data for this study were collected from female  victims at least 14 years of age who sought treatment (within one year  of being assault\ned) from the Sex Abuse Treatment Center (SATC) in  Honolulu, Hawaii, during 1987-1992. The SATC, at the time of data  collection, was the sole treatment center providing comprehensive  services to sexual assault victims on the island of Oahu, where the  city of Honolulu, the state capital and most densely populated urban  area, is located. Data were collected on two types of victims: (1)  immediate treatment seekers (ITS victims) and (2) delayed treatment  seekers (DTS victims). ITS victims were those who sought treatment  within 72 hours of an assault, and DTS victims were those who sought  treatment 72 hours or longer after an assault. The ITS subsample were  interviewed using the SATC emergency room intake form, which was a  structured self-report instrument administered by an SATC staff social  worker when intake occurred during office hours, or by a member of the  crisis intervention team on call during evenings, weekends, and  holidays. The DTS subsample were interviewed using a general  counseling form administered by an SATC social worker during the initial counseling session."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Demographic variables for the victims include age  at the time of the assault, marital status, employment status,  educational level, and race and ethnicity.
