Well designed program based on andragogy principles can enhance learning by motivating the learner and providing platform to encourage self directed learning. The present study aimed to explore the impact of program âNAMS-AIIMS Regional Symposium on Sleep Medicineâ in changing the behavior and attitude of participants using âSatisfaction Indexâ and descriptive analysis of responses as evaluation tools for program effectiveness. This descriptive cross sectional study captured the response of participants through a pre-tested and validated questionnaire administered at the end of symposium. The result showed almost equal sex distribution (M: F- 27: 34) with majority being UG students (86%). Reliability of data showed Cronbach's Alpha of 0.98 indicating high reliability. Satisfaction index (SI) calculated as per WHO Educational Handbook for Health Personnel showed highest satisfaction for conducive environment of symposium (87.87 %) followed by provision for time to seek clarifications (87.21%), provision of appropriate Learning Resource material (85.90 %) and handling of critical comments by organizers (85.57%). Descriptive analysis showed majority responses as highly positive to our questionnaire with suggestions for more such activity, inclusion of clinical cases and other aspects of practical relevance.
