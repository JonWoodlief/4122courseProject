Dagaa production on Lake Victoria showed a steady rise in volume from 418,590 to 674,616 tonnes between 2010 and 2015, attributed to increases in the stocks of dagaa, which attracted increased effort into the fishery. Uganda and Tanzania were exporters of dagaa while Kenya was an importer. The volume exported rose from 12,449 to 29,065 tonnes between 2010 and 2011 before it fell to 18,196 tonnes in 2015, attributed to increasing domestic demand for dagaa, especially in industrial feed production.\r\nThe main dagaa export destinations for Uganda and the average annual exports between 2010 and 2015 in tonnes were DRC (15,015 tonnes), Kenya (4,374 tonnes) and South Sudan (4,069 tonnes). Tanzanian exports were destined for Rwanda and DRC (31%) and Kenya (69%)\r\nDagaa was utilised in the region as human food in only a small proportion of less than 30% and the rest going into industrial feed mills as raw material for production of feeds for poultry, fish and livestock.\r\nHigh post-harvest loss was a key feature of dagaa trade in the region, including rotting or spoilage of dagaa due to insufficient sun-heat to dry it, particularly during rainy seasons.\r\n"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"distributor","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"distributorName":{"typeName":"distributorName","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorAffiliation":{"typeName":"distributorAffiliation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"WorldFish"},"distributorURL":{"typeName":"distributorURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/"},"distributorLogoURL":{"typeName":"distributorLogoURL","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://www.worldfishcenter.org/sites/default/files/worldfish-logo.jpg"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Muliro, Jacquie"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-08-08"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Raw data_QUALITY ATTRIBUTES AND DRYING RATE OF SILVER CYPRINID.xlsx","restricted":true,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":145744,"categories":["6.
