This survey, fielded July 27, 2000, is a call-back of the July 20-23, 2000, cohort (CBS NEWS/NEW YORK TIMES MONTHLY POLL #2, JULY 2000 [ICPSR 3121]), and was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and opinions about the 2000 presidential election, interest in the Republican and Democratic party conventions, readiness to vote in the upcoming election, and level of support for both candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Texas governor George W. Bush. Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, and the economy, as well as their views on the way Congress was handling its job. They were also asked whether on the day of the survey they would vote for Al Gore or George W. Bush. Those polled answered the same question once more, this time choosing among four candidates: Al Gore (Democratic Party candidate), George W. Bush (Republican Party candidate), Pat Buchanan (Reform Party candidate), and Ralph Nader (Green Party candidate). A set of questions regarding Dick Cheney, the Republican Party vice presidential candidate, was posed, including whether respondents were glad that George W. Bush named Cheney as his running mate, whether Cheney's personality influenced their decision on taking part in the election, and whether Cheney had the experience necessary to be a good vice president. Those polled expressed their opinions about Bill Clinton, Al Gore, George W. Bush, Ralph Nader, Pat Buchanan, and Dick Cheney, as well as about their respective parties. Information was elicited on respondents' participation and candidate selection in the 1996 presidential election and in the 1998 House of Representatives election. In addition, respondents answered a set of questions comparing Al Gore and George W. Bush as presidential candidates with respect to their qualities of leadership, their understanding of the complex problems a president has to deal with (especially international), if they could be trusted to keep their word as president, if they shared the same moral values as most Americans, if they said what they believed or what people wanted to hear, and if they cared about people like the respondent. Other questions examined respondents' opinions about both candidates' views on the following subjects: the economy, abortion, taxes, the environment, and health care. Those polled also expressed their views about whether the Democratic P\narty or the Republican Party was more likely to ensure a strong economy, make sure that the tax system was fair, make sure United States military defenses were strong, make the right decisions about Social Security, improve the education and health care systems, protect the environment, and uphold traditional family values, and which party cared more about people like the respondent. The survey also questioned respondents on other issues, such as the most important problems for the government in the coming year and abortion. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, race/ethnic identity, education, religion, voter registration and participation history, political party affiliation, political orientation, marital status, age of children in the household, and income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"abortion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Buchanan,
