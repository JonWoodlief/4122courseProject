The Pension Bureau determined the eligibility   of these individuals and issued military bounty land grants for up to   160 acres. Most of these land warrants were issued before 1860, but the   government continued to make grants through the remainder of the 19th   century. Because of these Congressional acts approximately one in nine   U.S. families received a land warrant for earlier military service.   Families usually sold their warrants for cash to third parties who then   prese\nnted them to the General Land Office as payments for parcels of   public land. Variables include the number of acres awarded to the   warrant recipient, the conflict in which the veteran served, his   wartime military rank, his state of residence, the public land office   where the warrant was located, the year the warrant was issued, and the   type of military unit in which the veteran served. Information is also   provided concerning the ability of the recipient to sign his name, the   relationship of the recipient to the original veteran, whether or not  the grant had been sold, and, if so, the name of the buyer."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"land distribution"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"land ownership"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military service"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"nineteenth century"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"veterans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IV.C.
