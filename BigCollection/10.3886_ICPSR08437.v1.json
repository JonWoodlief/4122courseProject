The first  was to evaluate three procedures currently available for the  classification of correctional inmates: the Risk Analysis method,  Megargee's Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory Typology, and  Toch's Prison Preference Inventory. Second, the research devised and  tested a postdictive model of adjustment to prison life. Third, a new  classification scheme was developed for predicting inmate adjustment  to prison life that considers individual and organizational  (contextual) factors and various interactions between the two. These  data were collected from a sample of 942 volunteer inmates from ten  New York state correctional facilities, five of which were maximum  security and five of which were medium security facilities. Only  one-half of the original 942 inmates completed the MMPI. Background  and questionnaire data were collected during the summer and fall of  1983. Outcome data on each inmate infraction were collected for a  three-year period prior to that time. Each case in Part 1, Merged  Survey Response File [PPQ, PEI, PAQ], represents survey response data  from an individual inmate, with variables from the Prison Preference  Questionnaire (PPQ), the Prison Environment Inventory (PEI), and the  Prison Adjustment Questionnaire (PAQ). Cases in Part 2, Medical  Records, are records of medical contacts and diagnoses of inmates'  illnesses. Part 3, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,  contains personality assessment information and scores for each  individual offender. Data in Part 4, Sample Data [Background  Characteristics], consist of individual-based variables covering  inmates' background characteristics. Part 5, Offenses and Disciplinary  Action Records, contains records of offenses and disciplinary action  by individual offender. The client number is unique and consistent across all data files."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"correctional facilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"inmates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
