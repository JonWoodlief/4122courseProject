The data collected in the   study address the following questions: (1) Does hypnosis or the   cognitive interview mitigate recall deficits that result from   emotionally upsetting events? (2) Does hypnosis or the cognitive   interview improve recall when individuals recall events in narrative   fashion? (3) Does hypnosis or the cognitive interview improve recall   when individuals are required to respond to each item in a set of   focused questions? (4) Does the cognitive interview improve recall   better than motivated control recall procedures? For this two-stage   study, subjects were randomly assigned to receive hypnosis, cognitive   interview, or control treatment. Stage 1 involved completing unrelated   questionnaires and viewing a short film containing an emotionally   upsetting criminal event. Stage 2 was conducted 3 to 13 days later (the   average was 6.5 days) and involved baseline information gathering about   the events in the film, application of the assigned treatment, and   post-treatment written recall of the events. Data were collected from   the written narratives provided by subjects and from an oral forced   recall of events in a post-experimental interview. Variables in File 1   include total information (correct, incorrect, confabulations, and   attributions) as well as new information given in the post-treatment   written narrative. The remaining variables in File 1 include score on   Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form A (HGSHS:A),   repressor status, and the number of days between viewing the film and   completing the baseline and post-treatment interviews. Variables in   File 2 were derived from the post-experimental oral forced recall   interview and include total correct and incorrect responses and   confidence ratings for correct and incorrect responses. The unit of  observation is the individual."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cognitive functioning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cognitive processes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"eyewitness memory"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"hypnosis"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"police investigations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
