The  study was conducted to assess respondents' interest in and opinions  about the 2000 election campaign for U\nnited States senator from New  York State. Respondents gave their opinions of senator candidates  Hilary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio, as well as their opinions of  former Governor Mario Cuomo and former Speaker of the House Newt  Gingrich. They were also asked about their readiness to vote in the  upcoming Senate election, whom were they going to vote for, and who,  in their opinion, would become state senator. Those polled  answered sets of questions comparing Hilary Clinton and Rick Lazio as  Senate candidates in terms of their experience, honesty, integrity,  maturity, and interest in people like themselves, as well as who would  better work with other members of the Senate, reform the health care  system, and improve the New York State economy. The survey questioned  respondents on President Bill Clinton's involvement in his wife's  campaign and Governor George Pataki's involvement in Lazio's  campaign. Those polled also described Hilary Clinton's and Rick  Lazio's political orientation and gave their opinions on a ban on  spending \"soft money\" and how to spend a budget surplus. The survey  elicited respondents' views on whether Clinton could represent  New York State in the Senate effectively without having lived in New  York for many years, whether Clinton or Lazio would support Israel in  the Senate, whether Clinton's involvement in a major health care  reform plan in President Clinton's administration influenced  respondents' voting decisions, whether they watched or listened to any  debates between Clinton and Lazio, whether they saw any commercials on  TV that supported Clinton or Lazio, and whether commercials helped  them to decide which candidate to vote for. Respondents were also  asked whom they would vote for in the upcoming presidential election:  Al Gore (Democratic Party candidate), George W. Bush (Republican Party  candidate), Pat Buchanan (Reform Party candidate), or Ralph Nader  (Green Party candidate). Additional questions probed respondents'  participation and candidate selection in the 1996 presidential  election and in the 1998 United States Senate election. Background  information on respondents includes age, gender, education,  race/ethnic identity, political party affiliation, political orientation, marital status, religion, and household income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
