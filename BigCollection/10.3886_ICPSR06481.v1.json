At the local level in each sampled county, survey  questionnaires were distributed to police chiefs of the largest city,  sheriffs, jail administrators, prosecutors, public defenders, chief  trial court judges, trial court administrators (where applicable), and  probation and parole agency heads. Data were collected at the state  level through surveys sent to attorneys general, commissioners of  corrections, prison wardens, state court administrators, and directors  of probation and parole. For the 1992-1994 survey, 13 separate  questionnaires were used. Police chiefs and sheriffs received the same  survey instruments, with a screening procedure employed to identify  sheriffs who handled law enforcement responsibilities. Of the 411  counties selected, 264 counties also employed trial court  administrators. Judges and trial court administrators received  identical survey instruments. A total of 546 surveys were mailed to  probation and parole agencies, with the same questions asked of state  and local officers. Counties that had separate agencies for probation  and parole were sent two surveys. All survey instruments were divided  into sections on workload (except that the wardens, jail  administrators, and corrections commissioners were sent a section on  jail use and crowding instead), staffing, operations and procedures,  and background. The staffing section of each survey queried  respondents on recruitment, retention, training, and number of  staff. The other sections varied from instrument to instrument, with  questions tailored to the responsibilities of the particular  agency. Most of the questionnaires asked about use of automated  information systems, programs, policies, or aspects of the facility or  security needing improvement, agency responsibilities and  jurisdictions, factors contributing to workload increases, budget,  number of fulltime employees and other staff, and contracted  services. Questions specific to police chiefs and sheriffs included  activities aimed at drug problems and whether they anticipated  increases in authorized strength in officers. Jail administrators,  corrections commissioners, and wardens were asked about factors  contributing to jail crowding, alternatives to jail, medical services  offered, drug testing and drug-related admissions, and inmate  classification. Topics covered by the surveys for prosecutors, public  defenders, judges, and state and trial court administrators included  types of cases handled, case timeliness, diversion and sentencing  alternatives, and court and jury management. State and local probation  and parole agency directors were asked about diagnostic tools,  contracted services, and drug testing.
