In addition to a structured interview that measures lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV substance use and psychiatric disorders, the study included an extensive battery of measures that assessed lifetime and recent stress exposure, subsyndromal depression and anxiety, social support, and psychosocial risk and protective factors thought to be implicated in their etiology. This community-based epidemiological study was motivated by theoretical linkages between the social system, differential exposure of individuals within the system to social factors that can harm health, and to others that are protective, to explain persistent health disparities at the population level. The study assessed major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, alcohol abuse and dependence, drug abuse and dependence, post-traumatic stress disorder, and antisocial personality disorder. Modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) were included to assess the latter two disorders, and to assess AD/HD. Sub-clinical depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). The measures of stress exposure in the study involved four dimensions of stressful experience: recent life events, chronic stress, lifetime major and potentially traumatic events, and discrimination stress."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"anxiety"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"depression (psychology)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"discrimination"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"emotional states"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life events"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"post-traumatic stress disorder"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"stress"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.

Vega, Principle Investigator). The Transitions project used a representative sample of the same school cohort, N=1,803, gathering survey interview data between January 1998 and June 2000, when participants were between 18 and 23 years of age (93\npercent were ages 19-21).  All female participants from the previous study (n=410) and a random sample of 1,273 male participants, were selected for the study. Because a relatively small number of girls was included in the parent study, a supplementary sample was randomly drawn from the 1990 6th and 7th grade public school system roster. The participation rates were 75.6 percent among boys, 80.5 percent among original girls, and 58.2 percent among supplementary girls."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI)"},{"typeName":"weighting","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The sample is stratified by sex and race/ethnicity, with approximately equal proportions male and female, and equal proportions African American, non-Cuban Hispanic, Cuban American, and non-Hispanic White.

Additional weights were formed to correct a participation bias that was found in the supplementary female sample. Girls from lower-SES families were more likely to participate than those from higher-SES families.
