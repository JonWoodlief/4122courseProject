For the study, members of the United States Society\nof   Toxicology and the lay public were surveyed about basic toxicological   concepts, assumptions, and interpretations regarding risk of chemical   toxicology. Chemicals were defined as including all chemical elements   and compounds, including pesticides, food additives, industrial   chemicals, household cleaning agents, and prescription and   nonprescription drugs. The researchers began by identifying several   fundamental principles and judgmental components within the science of   risk assessment. Questions were developed based on these fundamentals   in order to determine the extent to which lay people and experts share   the same beliefs and conceptual framework. Questions addressed the   following four topics: (1) dose-response sensitivity, (2) trust in   animal and bacterial studies, (3) attitudes toward chemicals, and (4)   attitudes toward reducing chemical risks. Demographic information for   Demographic information for expert data include highest academic degree   earned, fields of study, age, sex, race, health, organizational   affiliation, and current position at work. Demographic information for   lay public data include education, age, sex, marital status, race,   children, health, present employment status, career, and annual  household income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
