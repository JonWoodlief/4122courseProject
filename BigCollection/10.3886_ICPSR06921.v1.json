Elderly  citizens can be violated by caregivers or family members, as well as  by strangers. Abuse can also occur as the result of older adults'  limited ability to care for themselves. Given the potentially  confusing nature of the problem and the overlap with domestic assault,  law enforcement personnel have been particularly unclear as to the  laws concerning elder abuse and the role that police can and should  play. In 1983, a mandatory reporting law (M.G.L. Chapter 19A,  Sec. 14-26) regarding elder abuse went into effect in  Massachusetts. This law required certain professionals, including  police officers, to report all cases of suspected elder abuse (which  may be one or a combination of financial, emotional, physical, and  sexual abuse, as well as neglect) to a local protective service  agency. The Elder Protection Project was sponsored by the Attorney  General's Office and funded by the Massachusetts Committee on Criminal  Justice. The mission of the project was to train police officers to be  aware of the changing demographics of the elderly population in  Massachusetts and to communicate effectively and sensitively with  senior adults so that officers could effectively intervene, report,  and investigate instances of elder victimization, neglect, and  financial exploitation.

Advanced  traini\nng sessions were conducted between September 1993 and May  1994. This police training was offered in all regions of the state in  coordination with local Protective Service Agencies. Several months  following the training, a sample of individuals who were originally  invited to take the advanced training were mailed surveys to assess  the impact of the training project on those who participated in the  two-day training sessions. The first mailing of the survey was in  December 1994. A repeat mailing of the same survey was sent in  January 1995 in an effort to increase the number of respondents. The  deadline for the surveys to be returned was February 17, 1995, and  respondents could send the completed survey by facsimile or by mail in  the supplied self-addressed stamped envelope. The survey was designed  to allow respondents to answer the first portion regardless of whether  they participated in the police training, whereas the latter portion  was designated for training participants only. Respondents were  permitted to remain anonymous. As a result, guarantees could not be  made that the recipient of each survey actually participated in the  Elderly Protection Project's two-day training. The survey consisted of  both closed- and open-ended questions and was designed to elicit  information regarding familiarity with elder abuse laws, participation  in and evaluation of the training experience, and encounters with  elder abuse cases. The data were compiled solely by the staff conducting the evaluation."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Variables include the respondent's agency and job  title, type of elder abuse programs offered by the agency, the  respondent's estimate of the percentage of actual elder abuse reported  in his/her area, and the respondent's opinion on the greatest  obstacles to having elder abuse reported.
