Ten weeks after the diabetic induction using an injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg), four weeks of diabetic control was conducted. Erectile response, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were assessed.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nDuring the experiment, the C-group showed continuous weight gain, while the other groups suffered from weight loss. After start of diabetic control, the body weight of I-group was increased; whereas, there was no meaningful change in the P-group. Meanwhile, comparable blood glucose levels were achieved in the P- and I-groups. The erectile response was markedly decreased in the D-group, whereas the P- and I-groups were similar as good as the C-group. In addition, D-group showed the significant decrease in the cavernosal smooth muscle content and increased apoptosis. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 protein expression, phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 were significantly distorted in the D-group, while the P- and I-groups were comparable with the C-group.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nPhlorizin treatment resulted in the improvement of erectile function as same as insulin despite the lack of anabolic weight gains. These results suggest that control of blood glucose level rather than a type of anti-glycemic agents is more important for the prevention and treatment of diabetic erectile dysfunction"},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Park, Hyun Jun"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2019-01-27"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Phlorizin(except6).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":149865,"dataFile":{"id":3348262,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Phlorizin(except6).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":13843,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1688f51ca0e-581aeae83517","originalFileFormat":"text/csv","originalFormatLabel":"Comma Separated Values","originalFileSize":12356,"UNF":"UNF:6:TzC7Du2A7OHebnLTtfcBPQ==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"b9a308871791cdffb30a8dced3777f51","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"b9a308871791cdffb30a8dced3777f51"}}}]}}}
