Two major differences distinguish the  expanded version of the database from the original collection: the  addition of data on the decisions of the Vinson Court, and the  inclusion of the conference votes of the Vinson and Warren  courts. Whereas the original collection contained only the vote as  reported in the UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT REPORTS, the expanded  database includes all votes cast in conference. Concomitant with the  expansion of the database is a shift in its basic unit of  analysis. The original collection contained every case in which at  least one justice wrote an opinion, and cases without opinions were  excluded. This version includes every case in which the Court cast a  conference vote, with and without opinions. The justices cast many  more votes than they wrote opinions, and hence, the number of Warren  Court records in this version increased by more than a factor of two  over the original version. As in the original collection, distinct  aspects of the Court's decisions are covered by six types of  variables: (1) identification variables including case citation,  docket number, unit of analysis, and number of records per unit of  analysis, (2) background variables offering information on origin of  case, source of case, reason for granting cert, parties to the case,  direction of the lower court's decision, and manner in which the Court  takes jurisdiction, (3) chronological variables covering date of term  of court, chief justice, and natural court, (4) substantive variables  including multiple legal provisions, authority for decision, issue,  issue areas, and direction of decision, (5) outcome variables  supplying information on form of decision, disposition of case,  winning party, declaration of unconstitutionality, and multiple  memorandum decisions, and (6) voting and opinion variables pertaining  to the vote in the case and to the direction of the individual justices' votes."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"case processing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"court cases"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disposition (legal)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"judicial decisions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"judicial review"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legal history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court decisions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Supreme Court justices"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"twentieth century"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States Supreme Court"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XII.
