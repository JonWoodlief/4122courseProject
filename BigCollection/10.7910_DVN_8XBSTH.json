A core assumption of many mainstream approaches (and their econometric counterparts) is that states act independently to reach key positions on issues ranging from trade to monetary policy. Given the explosion of research on diffusion, hierarchy, and interdependence, however, such methodological nationalism seems increasingly difficult to sustain. Instead, states find their decision-making autonomy increasingly restricted by international and transnational forces.\r\nIn his new research note, “European Union Member States in Cross-National Analyses: The Dangers of Neglecting Supranational Policymaking,” Joe Weinberg reminds us of the pitfalls to neglecting these complex dynamics in large N analysis. In particular, he isolates the case of the European Union, in which member states have abdicated traditional domestic decision-making in many key sectors. This does not mean that member state interests do not matter but that they often cannot simply be modeled in the standard 2-level game analogy. This new reality becomes particularly problematic when states (like EU members) that are engaged in complex governance arrangements are included in data sets with states that are not. Weinberg, then, is part of a next generation of scholars grappling with the methodological and theoretical challenges of studying the political consequences of interdependence.[...]"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Symposium"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Weinberg, J.
