It was conducted in two waves. The first wave queried officers who were scheduled to be released from service within six months, officers who were not scheduled to be released, and the wives of the officers. The second wave of interviews followed-up with the initial respondents approximately 18 months later. The groups in the second wave consisted of either current or former servicemen and their wives. A major focus of the study was employment. During the first wave, officers and their wives were queried on their current employment status, whether they were satisfied with their salary, the level of skill required in their work, and their supervisor's management style. Additionally, wives were asked if their job interfered with aspects of their lives, while servicemen were asked about their army careers. Questions included how long they had served in the military, whether they were active participants in war, how loyal they felt toward the army, whether or not they planned on leaving, and what reasons were behind any plans to leave. Servicemen were asked about their level of education, whether they had completed any additional school or training courses, and if they had any civilian job experience. They were also asked what important aspects they desired in a new job, and how confident they were that they would find employment that met those desires. A second major focus was living conditions. Questions included how much food allowance they were provided by the army, how many times they and their family had moved as a requirement of their career, which services and resources they had access in their present location, the effect retirement would have on them personally as well as on their families, and what government assistance would be provided upon retirement. They were further queried about whether they currently had enough money for necessities and if their housing was provided by the army. A third major focus of the study was health. Respondents were questioned about their experience with health concerns (headaches, anxiety, etc.) and the frequency of occurrence. They were asked if they or their families had experienced significant events in the past year such as the death of a child, or the loss of their home due to natural disaster. They were also asked if they drank alcohol, the amount they consumed, and whether they or anyone close to them felt they had a problem with alcohol abuse. They were also asked whether or not they smoked, and if so, how much. A fourth major focus was social relationships and behaviors. Questions included their relationship with their spouse and their family, whether they had a confidante, in whom they confided. They were asked if they got together with neighbors, attended religious services and, if so, how often they participated in these events. A fifth major focus was the respondents' opinions about the downsiz\ning of the military. They were asked if the assistance being offered was sufficient, whether the reimbursement package provided was adequate, and how they felt others were being affected by the downsizing. Respondents were also queried as to whom they felt deserved the blame for the downsizing of the military. During the second wave, respondents were contacted for follow-up interviews. In addition to the questions previously asked during the first wave, respondents were asked if their spouse had changed, whether their family remained the same size, and about their employment status as compared to one year prior. Former servicemen were asked if they had new employment and how they acquired their new job. If unemployed, respondents were asked if they intended to find new work and, if not, what their reasons were for not seeking employment. If seeking employment, they were asked what type of job they would like, and how confident they were that they would be able to find work. Additionally, former servicemen were asked to compare life as a civilian to their life of army service in various areas. They were also asked about life at home, their relationship with their wives, who was responsible for the key decisions in the household, and the percentage of housework they do. They were also queried about whether the work of their wives interfered with family responsibilities. If applicable, wives were asked how they were affected by their husband's discharge from the military. They were further queried whether household disagreements, child care difficulties, and problems with marital relations had arisen due to the workload of their husband at a new place of employment. They were asked about the level of help the families of servicemen needed from the government, as well as their attitude toward their husband's military service career. Demographic questions included marital status, religious beliefs, affiliation with a particular church, ethnicity, and monthly income."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol consumption"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment qualifications"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family relationships"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family work relationship"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job opportunities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job search"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"life satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marital relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marital satisfaction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military benefits"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military families"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military officers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military pay"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military pensions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"military service"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"occupations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.
