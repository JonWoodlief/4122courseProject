This research examines the relationship  between states' Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)  payments and teen birthrates. Drawing on rational choice theories, the  investigators expected the effects of states' AFDC payments on their  teen birthrates to be positive, taking unemployment rates, racial  composition, and poverty rates into account. The effects of states'  AFDC payments were significant in a negative direction in Model 1, a  random effects model. They also were significant in\na negative  direction in Model 2 when the effects of year were controlled  for. However, when the effects of year and state in Model 3 were  controlled for, they were not significant. The findings do not support  assumptions regarding the incentive effects of welfare that underlie  rational choice theories in states where teen birthrates are  higher. If anything, teen birthrates are higher in states where AFDC  payments are lower. Implications for policy and further research are  discussed in relation to the positive effects of states' poverty and population change rates on the state teen birthrate problem."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"birth rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public assistance programs"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teenage pregnancies"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
