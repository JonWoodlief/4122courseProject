The investigators   compare three robbery events: those that resulted in death, those that   cause injury, and nonfatal robberies of all types. The events were   compared on a variety of demographic variables. The data address the   following questions: (1) To what extent are homicides resulting from   robbery misclassified as homicides for which motives are undetermined?   (2) How often do homicides resulting from robbery involve individuals   who do not know each other? (3) Are robberies that involve illicit   drugs more likely to result in the death of the victim? (4) To what   extent does a weapon used in a robbery affect the probability that a   victim will die? (5) To what extent does victim resistance affect the   likelihood of victim death? (6) To what extent does robbery lead to   physical injury? (7) Do individuals of different races suffer   disproportionately from injuries resulting from robbery? (8) Are   injuries and homicides resulting from robbery more likely to occur in a   residence, commercial establishment, or on the street? (9) Are women or   men more likely to be victims of homicide or injury resulting from   robbery? (10) To what extent does robbery (with or without a homicide)   occur between or within races? (12) How long does it take to solve   robbery-related crimes? Major variables characterizing the unit of   observation, the robbery event, include: location of the robbery   incident, numbers of offenders and victims involved in the incident,   victim's and offender's prior arrest and conviction histories, the   extent of injury, whether or not drugs were involved in any way, type   of weapon used, victim/offender relationship, and the extent of victim  resistance."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"aggravated assault"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"assault"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"homicide"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"murder"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"robbery"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victimization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"victims"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.
