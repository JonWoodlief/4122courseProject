The center uses a holistic approach in the treatment of  youth to identify the triggers for substance abuse and to investigate  the relationship between substance abuse and delinquent behavior. For  the facility assessment, various types of data from the Virginia  Department of Juvenile Justice were gathered. Baseline data on each  juvenile were obtained from the department's Reception and Diagnostic  Center and consisted of demographic information and I.Q. scores,  criminal history, and substance abuse history. Demographic variables  include the youth's race, last grade placement, and with whom the  youth lived. Youths' scores on standardized tests were also compiled,  including SASSI, verbal I.Q., performance I.Q., and full-scale  I.Q. scores. Criminal histories covered whether the committing offense  was a felony or misdemeanor, the type of committing offense, the total  number of committing offenses, whether a prior offense was a felony or  a misdemeanor, the type of prior offense, the total number of prior  offenses, the age at first criminal adjudication, age at commitment,  and degree of delinquency. Alcohol and drug use data focused on the  age at which alcohol was first used, number of times alcohol was used  in the past year, age at which marijuana was first used, number of  times marijuana was used in the past month, and whether the youth ever  used cocaine, crack, inhalants, speed, depressants, hallucinogens, or  other drugs. Another source of information was the youths' parole  officers, who provided data on youths' criminal offending status and  substance abuse at three, six, and twelve months after release from  the center. Data obtained from parole officers assessing youths'  improvement after leaving the center include whether they were  rearrested, the type of offense if rearrested, the total number of  offenses rearrested for, disposition, most serious offense overall, and youths' overall drug use."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Barrett Juvenile Correctional Center began  operating as a substance abuse treatment facility for convicted male  offenders in late 1993. To be admitted to the facility, a youth had to  fit the following criteria: they had to (a) be male, (b) be between  the ages of 13-18, (c) have a mandatory or recommended need for  substance abuse treatment, (d) have a length of stay of no less than  six months, (e) not have a major mental illness or severely limited  cognitive ability, and (f) not have committed a major offense (defined  as murder, rape, forcible sodomy, or arson). The center uses a  holistic approach to the treatment of youth to identify the triggers  for substance abuse and to investigate the relationship between  substance abuse and delinquent behavior. The center recognizes the  interrelationship of all aspects of the youth's life in producing a  delinquent lifestyle. It provides a highly structured program that  uses a therapeutic community approach to tr\neat the offender. This  approach emphasizes personal growth and responsibility. The purpose of  this research was to examine the program design, structure,  implementation, and process and to provide a preliminary assessment of  the program's impact on youth. The assessment centered on (1) the  number of youths who were rearrested after leaving the center, (2) the  number who were recommitted, and (3) the number who used a substance during the one-year follow-up period."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The effectiveness of the program at the Barrett  Juvenile Correction Center was addressed by gathering various types of  data from the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice.
