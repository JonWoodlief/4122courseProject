Unlike the public-use longitudinal files released in previous rounds, this file contains all data for all ECLS-K sample cases that have been publicly released in any of the rounds. Thus, it can be used for within-year (cross-sectional) analyses of any round of data collection and cross-year (longitudinal) analyses of combinations of rounds. It focuses on children's early school experiences beginning with kindergarten through eighth grade. It is a nationally representative sample that collects information from children, their families, their teachers, and their schools. ECLS-K provides data about the effects of a wide range of family, school, community, and individual variables on children's cogni\ntive, social, emotional, and physical development, their early learning and early performance in school, as well as their home environment, home educational practices, school environment, classroom environment, classroom curriculum, and teacher qualifications. The list below summarizes each wave of this study.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>1998-1999 (the Kindergarten year-Rounds 1 and 2): The ECLS-K child assessments, parent interviews, and teacher questionnaires were conducted in the fall.

For more information on locating particular documents, please refer to the ECLS-K document matrix.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The Stata files provided for the K-8 full sample data are those taken directly from the National Center for Education Statistics (without any modifications).  Due to the large size of the data files, Stata needs to be installed with the maximum memory alloted from the operating system.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Given the size of the K-8 file, it may take several minutes to get the data and ready-to-go files to load.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) releases the ECLS-K data as public-use and restricted-use files; ICPSR only releases the public-use files. Restricted-use files differ from the public-use version in that they contain variables that have been suppressed in the K-8 public-use version to protect respondent confidentiality (such as geographic indicators). Nonetheless, suppressed variables are labeled on the K-8 public-use file to maintain structure; data values are simply set to a reserve code or blanked. Other modifications found in the K-8 public-use file include composite variables describing children's family structure and family member characteristics. See Table 7-16 of the User Guide for a list of variables that are modified or suppressed in the K-8 public-use version of the data.

The initial sample size was developed taking into account the reduction in sample size and increase in the variability of the weights of the respondents resulting from the s\nubsampling. As the design was extended beyond fifth grade (the initial planning of the ECLS-K did not plan for this extension into eighth grade), a change in the methods of handling movers to avoid subsampling them was needed to achieve the major analytic goals. The vast majority of children were not in the same school from kindergarten to eighth grade (having moved out of elementary schools into middle schools), and subsampling these movers would result in substantial losses in sample size and precision of the estimates for the eighth grade.</p>"},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI)"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."},{"typeName":"responseRate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The ECLS-K overall response rate can be computed by the product of the school-level response rate from the base ye\nar and the completion rates from each round of data collection after the base year.
