Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the European Community (EC), including how well-informed they felt about the EC, what sources of information about the EC they used, whether their country had benefited from being an EC member, and the extent of their personal interest in EC matters. Other major areas of focus of the surveys included: (1) life and interests, (2) foreign languages and traveling abroad, (3) employment and education, and (4) foreign relations. For the first topic, life and interests,\nrespondents were asked: to identify their areas of interest, ideas or causes they support, three major problems facing youth today, to list their membership in particular organizations, their use of neighborhood youth services or centers, how well-informed they felt about opportunities of interest, with whom they lived, and how well different aspects of life were going. For the second topic, languages, respondents were asked about languages learned and those spoken well enough to converse with others, languages used at home, reasons and methods for learning a new language, and the teaching and importance of knowing foreign languages. Pertaining to traveling abroad, respondents were asked about the countries they visited, the duration and reasons for visiting, travel arrangements, and the main problem in traveling abroad. For the third topic, employment and education, respondents were asked about their experiences with youth discrimination, their personal financial situation, and services or individuals who assisted them in making life choices. Respondents employed full- or part-time were asked about methods used to obtain a job, duration of employment, hours worked per week, average pay rate, job satisfaction, chances for promotion, and past episodes of employment and unemployment. Respondents in school were asked about current studies and the type of institution they attended, while those in vocational training were asked about when they started the program, length of attendance, opinions regarding completion, and trainee benefits. Unemployed respondents were asked about the reasons why and the length of time they were unemployed, as well as their job-seeking methods. All respondents, except those in school, were asked about formal education, satisfaction with training courses, assistance with job attainment through training, and receipt of a diploma or certificate. For the final topic, foreign relations, respondents were asked about their feelings about the United States and its present policy towards West European unification, the relationship between the EC and the United States, establishment of the Common European Market, and the unification of Europe. Less of a focus were questions about the qualities children are encouraged to learn at home, their knowledge of a European program for the fight against cancer, and their skills and education in computers. Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, marital status, age whenexpecting to finish full-time education, size and composition of household, family income, occupation, size of company where respondent works, type and size of community, and region of residence. Several questions pertaining to voting and politics include political party attachment, vote intention, and left-right political self-placement."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"age

For two cases, it was not possible to trace the origin of the respondent (code '3'). The complete youth questionnaire was only asked of the oversample (code '2'). For those questions that were not asked in the framework of the standard survey, split groups 1 and 3 are coded to \"Inap. - not Y OVERSAMPLE (V4)\".

Some question numbers are intentionally skipped, however neither questions nor data are missing.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: V400 (VOTE INTENTION - DENMARK): Danish respondents who declared for political party \"Venstre\" had been coded as falling into the missing value category during the raw data processing for Eurobarometer 28 and 28.1. The original coding for Eurobarometer 28 has been made available by Danish Gallup via Danish Data Archives. The ZA corrected the Danish data for 'VOTE INTENTION' accordingly for Eurobarometer 28, and as far as possible, also applied the corrections to Eurobarometer 28.1. Reponses for \"Venstre\" could not be recovered, and collapsed responses for \"De Groenne\" and \"Fremskridtspartiet\" not be separated.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: Since variable V446 (SIZE OF COMMUNITY - GREAT BRITAIN) is not available, all cases have been coded \"Inap.
