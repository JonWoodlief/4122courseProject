Attitudes were studied in an attempt to ascertain the factors that predicted interest in computers at the college level. The effects of Harvard's core computer literacy requirement were also studied.\r\n<br /><br />  A total of 270 first-year students at Harvard and Radcliffe participated in this study. Questionnaires were distributed to students early in the fall, and in December a second questionnaire was given to those students who had completed and returned the first questionnaire.<br /><br />  The precoded questionnaire solicited demographic information, and contained two scales measuring attitudes towards the core computer requirement and towards the use of computers. The questionnaire also contained several open-ended Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)-type response cues, such as: \"Jane is a Classics major. The Classics department is undergoing a large push towards computerization.
