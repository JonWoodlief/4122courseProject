Freedom from Hunger implemented a test of its direct marketing solicitations, varying letters by whether they include a discussion of their program’s impact as measured by scientiﬁc research. The base script, used for both treatment and control, included a standard qualitative story about an individual beneﬁciary. Adding scientiﬁc impact information has no effect on average likelihood of giving or average gift amount. However, we ﬁnd important heterogeneity: large prior donors both are more likely to give and also give more, whereas small prior donors are less likely to give. This pattern is consistent with two different types of donors: warm glow donors who respond negatively to analytical effectiveness information, and altruism donors who respond positively to such information."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Aid effectiveness"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Charitable fundraising"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Warm glow"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Pure altruism"}}]},{"typeName":"language","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["English"]},{"typeName":"grantNumber","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"grantNumberAgency":{"typeName":"grantNumberAgency","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Henry E.

Subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of three different types of solicitation, with the randomization stratiﬁed based on most recent donation year and previous donation amount above or below $100. About two-thirds (11,258) of the sample was assigned to control which contained a standard emotional and personal story about a program participant in Bolivia. The treatment group (5631) received an identical insert with the exception of the ﬁnal paragraph, which instead mentioned studies that used “rigorous scientiﬁc methodologies” (the exact script is in Appendix A) demonstrating the positive impact of the particular FFH program.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second wave, October 2008, mailers were sent to 17,784 individuals who donated to FFH at least once between 2005 and 2008. Randomization was stratiﬁed on size of most recent donation (above/below $100), experimental status in the June 2007 round, and whether or not the donor had donated in 2008. Again, all individuals were mailed a renewal letter requesting donations and providing an update on one of FFH’s regional programs. Of the sample, 5960 were in the control group and received a renewal letter with an emotional appeal to an identiﬁable victim. A further 5903 received an identical renewal letter, except that there were additional paragraphs detailing the effectiveness of FFH programs in helping people like the previously introduced victim. The ﬁnal 5921 received the same letter as the other 5903 in the treatment group, except that their letters explicitly cited Yale-aﬃliated researchers as the source of the statistics on the program’s effectiveness. The probability of assignment to treatment was adjusted to maximize power, conditional on the stratiﬁcation variables, as per the procedures details in Hahn, Hirano and Karlan (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is overlap across the two waves, however our analysis pools the two irrespective of what individuals received in the prior mailer (and lack of power precludes our ability to build and test theories on how the two waves may interact with each other). Thus the pooled sample consists of 34,673 mailers to 21,643 prior donors. Of these, 13,030 prior donors were included in both June 2007 and October 2008 wave; 3859 in the June 2007 wave only; and 4754 in the October 2008 wave only. For the 21,643 in both waves, given the time gap in between the waves, each individual wave is treated as one observation."},{"typeName":"collectionMode","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Direct-mail marketing"}]}},"files":[{"description":"This file contains user-written commands needed to run the code.","label":"ado.zip","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":129520,"dataFile":{"id":3059492,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/Q0Q1FG","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/Q0Q1FG","filename":"ado.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":113797,"description":"This file contains user-written commands needed to run the code.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f31540042-61fc6cb658c4","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"300343bad48d54ad81f5039d96bc6cee","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"300343bad48d54ad81f5039d96bc6cee"}}},{"description":"This folder contains all of the files necessary to replicate the results in the publication.","label":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files.zip","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":129520,"dataFile":{"id":3059497,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/RGMKPQ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/RGMKPQ","filename":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files.zip","contentType":"application/zip","filesize":1971089,"description":"This folder contains all of the files necessary to replicate the results in the publication.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f3159a883-842f34dc7bc5","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"395b7839ca9dfaf771227203d0ce5ed6","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"395b7839ca9dfaf771227203d0ce5ed6"}}},{"description":"This is the corresponding codebook for the FFH_analysis dataset.","label":"FFH_analysis_codebook.xls","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files/codebooks","version":1,"datasetVersionId":129520,"dataFile":{"id":3059493,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/R57HHU","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/R57HHU","filename":"FFH_analysis_codebook.xls","contentType":"application/vnd.ms-excel","filesize":24064,"description":"This is the corresponding codebook for the FFH_analysis dataset.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f31540188-77ae618f59e6","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"398769a00ac0a000c4613da8f3ec152e","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"398769a00ac0a000c4613da8f3ec152e"}}},{"description":"This file contains all of the code needed to replicate the main and appendix tables and\r\ngraphs in the paper.","label":"FFH_analysis.do","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files/do","version":1,"datasetVersionId":129520,"dataFile":{"id":3059495,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/Q2XUMW","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/Q2XUMW","filename":"FFH_analysis.do","contentType":"application/x-stata-syntax","filesize":17937,"description":"This file contains all of the code needed to replicate the main and appendix tables and\r\ngraphs in the paper.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f31540333-c1901cbf5b78","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d3d16fc64648875ab3256b1047849f32","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d3d16fc64648875ab3256b1047849f32"}}},{"description":"This file contains individual-level donation data merged with census data.","label":"FFH_analysis.tab","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files/data","version":2,"datasetVersionId":129520,"dataFile":{"id":3059494,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/YQ3QYU","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/YQ3QYU","filename":"FFH_analysis.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":13967297,"description":"This file contains individual-level donation data merged with census data.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f315402b0-ce6ea06a17f5","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata-13","originalFormatLabel":"Stata 13 Binary","originalFileSize":14339606,"UNF":"UNF:6:/4inN17v5fO0z1k4w8dspw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"1fef48cb807f4b9bd674d8aa9739e224","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"1fef48cb807f4b9bd674d8aa9739e224"}}},{"description":"This ReadMe file contains basic information about the data, code, user-written commands, and software compatibility.","label":"ReadMe.pdf","restricted":false,"directoryLabel":"Effectiveness Dataverse Files","version":1,"datasetVersionId":129520,"dataFile":{"id":3059496,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/PNHOPX","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/RDHJQZ/PNHOPX","filename":"ReadMe.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":205547,"description":"This ReadMe file contains basic information about the data, code, user-written commands, and software compatibility.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15f31540354-327d64506855","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"e4ce7f246ac9544a175a8742e20786dd","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"e4ce7f246ac9544a175a8742e20786dd"}}}]}}}
