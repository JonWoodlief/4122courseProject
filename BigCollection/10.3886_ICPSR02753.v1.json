During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the  two major cities in Nevada -- Las Vegas (Clark County) and Reno  (Washoe County) -- experienced what could be characterized as a \"gang  panic.\" In response to several high profile, violent crimes by  minority males, which were reported by law enforcement officials as  being gang-related, Nevada lawmakers enacted an array of anti-gang  legislation, much of it drafted by law enforcement personnel. Police  gang units were created or augmented and tough suppression strategies  were employed. Special prosecutorial units were developed within  district attorneys' offices to prosecute gang crimes more effectively,  with higher conviction rates and more severe sanctions for gang  members who commit crimes.
