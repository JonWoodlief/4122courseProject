Evidence increasingly suggests, however, that human rights laws are most effective in stable or consolidating democracies or in states with strong civil society activism. If so, treaties may be failing to make a difference in those states most in need of reform—the world’s worst abusers—even though they have been the targets of the human rights regime from the very beginning. We address this question of compliance by focusing on the behavior of repressive states in particular. Through a series of cross-national analyses on the impact of two key human rights treaties, we demonstrate: (1) that governments, including repressive ones, frequently make legal commitments to human rights treaties, subscribing to recognized norms of protection and creating opportunities for socialization and capacity building necessary for lasting reforms; (2) that these commitments have no clear or independent effects even long into the future; (3) that recent findings that treaty effectiveness is conditional on democracy and civil society do not hold for the world’s real repressors; and (4) that realistic institutional reforms will not help to solve the problem"}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Emilie M.
