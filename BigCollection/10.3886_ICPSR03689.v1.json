Researchers were able to secure the  cooperation of four courts: (1) Bronx County Supreme Court in New  York, (2) Los Angeles County Superior Court in California, (3)  Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona, and (4) District of  Columbia Superior Court in Washington, DC. The four sites were  responsible for distributing and collecting questionnaire packets to  all courtrooms hearing non-capital felony jury cases. Each packet  contained a case data form requesting information about case  characteristics (Part 1) and outcomes (Part 2), as well as survey  questionnaires for the judges (Part 3), attorneys (Part 4), and jurors  (Part 5). The case data form requested type of charge, sentence range,  jury's decision, demographic information about the defendant(s) and  the victim(s), voir dire (jury selection process), trial evidence and  procedures, and jury deliberations. The judge questionnaire probed  for evaluation of the evidence, case complexity, attorney skill,  likelihood that the jury would hang, reaction to the verdict, opinions  regarding the hung jury rate in the jurisdiction, and experience on  the bench. The attorney questionnaire requested information assessing  the voir dire, case complexity, attorney skill, evaluation of the  evidence, reaction to the verdict, opinions regarding the hung jury  rate in the jurisdiction, and experience in legal practice. If the  jury hung, attorneys also provided their views about why the jury was  unable to reach a verdict. Finally, the juror questionnaire requested  responses regarding case complexity, attorney skill, evaluation of the  evidence, formation of opinions, dynamics of the deliberations  including the first and final votes, juror p\narticipation, conflict,  reaction to the verdict, opinions about applicable law, assessment of criminal justice in the community, and demographic information."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In the mid to late 1990s, the criminal justice  community developed an intense interest in the phenomenon of jury  deadlock, more commonly known as a \"hung jury.\" Several factors  prompted this interest. A number of communities, especially in  California, were reporting that more and more criminal jury trials  were routinely resulting in mistrials due to jury deadlock. Other  urban areas including the District of Columbia and Manhattan, New  York, began reporting similar trends regarding hung jury rates. These  increasing numbers raised significant concerns about the monetary  costs associated with retrying cases as well as the emotional toll on  victims and witnesses and potential public safety costs associated  with criminal defendants serving less time in prison due to the  failure of the jury to convict. Despite new of proposals designed to  reduce the number of hung juries, no government agency or research  institution has ever determined a \"normal\" hung jury rate or standards  for an acceptable range of hung jury rates. Consequently, it is  difficult to compare current hung jury rates to a baseline. Although  there is much speculation about the factors that contribute to jury  deadlock (evidentiary problems such as witness credibility, jury  misunderstanding of evidence or substantive law, racial conflict, jury  nullification), very little empirical research exists to verify these  claims. This study was undertaken for the purpose of providing an empirical picture of hung juries."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Originally, researchers envisioned their project  as a two-phase process. In the first phase, researchers proposed to  conduct a broad-based survey of hung jury rates in state and federal  courts while the second phase would consist of an in-depth examination  of jury behavior in ten jurisdictions to compare case and jury  characteristics in felony trials that resulted in a verdict to those  that resulted in jury deadlock. The first phase turned out to be  critically important to the project. Ultimately, researchers were able  to collect and compile statistics about hung juries from state courts  and from prosecutors' offices in 30 jurisdictions and from all federal  courts. However, in doing so, they discovered an important source of  variation across jurisdictions -- the definition of a \"hung jury.\" In  some jurisdictions, a jury was counted as \"hung\" if it failed to reach  a verdict on any charge or on any defendant. In other jurisdictions, a  hung jury was only counted if it hung on the most serious charge. Some  only counted a hung jury if it hung on all counts or on all  defendants. Obviously, these disparate definitions had a significant  effect on hung jury rates and made it very difficult to compare rates  across jurisdictions. The research team wanted to be be able to  capture this degree of detail in the second phase of the study. The  second phase of the study (comprising the data in this collection) was  intended to compare various characteristics of jury trials that  resulted in deadlock to those that resulted in verdicts across at  least ten jurisdictions. However, some courts declined to participate  due to concerns about the administrative burden of data collection on  their staff. A more significant issue, however, was judicial  sensitivity to the inviolability of jury deliberations, especially in  felony jury trials. In spite of various procedures that researchers  put in place to protect the confidentiality of the data, many courts  were concerned that the information collected from jurors might  provide a basis for convicted defendants to appeal the verdict.  Researchers were able to secure the cooperation of only four courts:  (1) Bronx County Supreme Court in New York, (2) Los Angeles C\nounty  Superior Court in California, (3) Maricopa County Superior Court in  Arizona, and (4) District of Columbia Superior Court in Washington,  DC. The four sites were responsible for distributing and collecting  questionnaire packets in all courtrooms hearing non-capital felony  jury cases. Misdemeanor cases were excluded because hung juries in  serious felony trials are typically of greater concern to justice  system policymakers. Capital cases were also excluded because of the  severity of the sanction and the potential that confidential juror  questionnaire data might be requested to support an appeal from a  conviction. The data collection protocol and questionnaire materials  underwent a pretest in Los Angeles in July 1999. Fifty trial  packages containing questionnaires and case data forms were  distributed to judges in non-capital felony trials. The research staff  obtained data on 16 completed trials including two hung jury  trials. In December 1999, the project Advisory Committee offered its  recommendations for modifications to the survey instruments and data  collection protocols. Based on these recommendations, the surveys were  revised to more accurately capture the nuances of measuring hung jury  rates. In addition, one of the questionnaires that was to be  administered to jurors was revised to avoid responses that would  provide grounds for a defendant's inquiry into the validity of the  verdict. Finally, data collection protocols were refined to increase  the return rate of survey packets. Each packet contained a case data  form requesting information about case characteristics (Part 1) and  outcomes (Part 2) as well as instructions and questionnaires for the  judge (Part 3), attorneys (Part 4), and jurors (Part 5). Judges and  key court personnel were briefed on the project and instructed as to  how the packet distribution was to occur. Packets were sent from the  jury assembly room to the courtrooms with the panel for voir dire  (jury selection process). Once the jury was selected, court personnel  distributed the packets to the judge and/or court clerk. If the case  proceeded through to jury deliberations and was not prematurely ended  by a plea agreement, dismissal, or mistrial for some reason other than  the jury's inability to arrive at a unanimous verdict, the judge was  asked to complete the judge survey. In addition, either the clerk or  the judge was to complete a questionnaire on the general case  information using a case data survey form. Once the jury retired to  deliberate, court personnel distributed the judge and attorney  questionnaires. The judges and attorneys were asked to complete the  questionnaires in two stages, answering some questions prior to the  jury decision and the remaining questions after the jury rendered its  verdict or the case was declared a mistrial. The court personnel  distributed the final set of questionnaires to the jurors after the  verdict was announced or a mistrial declared. To protect  confidentiality, respondents were provided blank envelopes in which to  place the completed questionnaire. Court staff collected the completed  questionnaires and gave these to the designated court liaison for each  site, who forwarded the cases on to the project staff for data entry  and analysis. Because the study design included collection of  information from key trial participants, including jurors, a protocol  was developed that balanced the importance of confidentiality and the  defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. The National Institute of Justice  (NIJ) regulations required that the research team maintain the  confidentiality of study data and prohibit their use in adjudicatory  proceedings. The purpose of these regulations is to protect the safety  and privacy of study participants (in this instance the judges,  attorneys, and jurors). However, the Sixth Amendment right of criminal  plaintiffs to a fair and impartial jury supersedes any NIJ  regulations. To protect jurors\n' privacy in the event of these  competing demands, the research team revised certain survey questions,  following the pilot test phase, to eliminate questions that would  provide a prima facie basis for an appeal (e.g., timing of opinion  formation). They also stripped any identifying case information from  the questionnaires and destroyed the hard copies after the data were  entered into the database housed at the National Center for State Courts."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1, Case Data, variables include the race and  gender of victim(s) and defendant(s), size of panel from which the  jury was selected, length of the voir dire process, who conducted the  voir dire, reason a juror was struck, number of jurors struck by  prosecution and by defendant, length of trial, number of prosecution  witnesses, prosecution expert witnesses, prosecution exhibits, defense  witnesses, defense expert witnesses, and defense exhibits, whether  juror notebooks were provided, total number of questions submitted by  jurors to witnesses, length of deliberation, number of deliberating  jurors, and how the foreperson was selected.
