Participants were interviewed once for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours, and answered questions about intimate partner violence (with their most recent partner and/or with a previous partner), physical health, emotional well-being, experiences of traumatic life events, strategic responses to abuse, experiences of child abuse, and other related experiences/knowledge.

Metro State is a close/maximum security facility in the Georgia Department of Corrections. As one of three facilities for incarcerated women in Georgia, Metro State serves as the central receiving and diagnostic unit for the state correctional system. All women who serve a portion of their sentence in a Georgia correctional facility begin incarceration in the Diagnostic Unit at Metro State. Inmates typically spend two to four weeks in this unit. All women who entered Metro State between June 2000 and June 2001 were eligible to participate. Weekly, using a random number table, the principal investigators selected approximately twenty women from a list of all women entering the diagnostic unit and invited these women to participate in an informational meeting about the study. At this meeting, women who elected to sign informed consent agreements were given an interview date within a two-week timeframe. On a weekly basis, the names and interview times for inmates who agreed to participate were given to MSWP staff, who called inmates to a \"hold-in\" area (i.e., a secure location supervised by correctional staff where inmates wait for appointments) when it was time for their interview. Interviews were conducted in small, private, soundproof, windowed rooms located close to a security station. Each interview lasted approximately 1Â½ to 2 hours. All interviews were oral because of low literacy rates in incarcerated populations. To assist inmates, interviewers provided response card books that listed possible responses for questions using Likert-type scales. Inmates were asked questions on topics including intimate partner violence, physical health, emotional well-being, strategic responses, and experiences of child abuse. Data about inmates were also collected from their administrative records.</p>\n\n<p>To obtain a pilot sample to refine and evaluate the initial item set and a validation sample to use for eva\nluating the psychometric properties of the measure, the MSWP sample of 403 was divided into 2 groups. The pilot sample was derived from the first 206 participants (51 percent of the overall sample). It comprised 67 participants from the pilot sample who reported abusive experiences in their most recent relationship before incarceration. The validation sample was derived from the second group of 197 participants (49 percent of the overall sample). It includes 96 women from the validation sample who reported abusive experiences in their most recent relationship before incarceration. As a result of the pilot study, some questions were dropped or altered for some parts of the questionnaire.</p>\n\n<p>The second data collection setting was the Grady Health Center, a large, inner-city, public hospital, which served as the recruitment site for the nonincarcerated women. Researchers collected data from patients waiting to receive medical care in one of three primary care clinics: the Urgent Care Center, the Obstetric-Gynecological (OB-GYN) clinic, and the Family Planning and Prenatal clinic. Researchers were randomly assigned to a particular clinic each day. Interviewers chose a seat in the waiting room and moved in one direction around the room until a woman agreed to participate. Once a woman agreed to participate, the researcher briefly explained the study, confidentiality, and compensation ($20 per participant). Researchers interviewed women in unused exam rooms or private areas. For the most part, women in this sample were asked the same questions as the women in the prison, however modifications were made where necessary to have questions be relevant for a non-prison setting. A total of 197 women were interviewed at the Grady Health Center.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The data include a total of 1,087 variables, which are divided into 22 sections:</p>\n\n<p><ol>\n<li>Study-level variables: variables  recorded by researchers including sample, mental health caseload status, interview version, whether types of questions were answered, and whether intimate partner violence questions were asked about the woman's most recent partner.</li>\n<li>Demographics Self-report items: variables on race,  children, education, housing status, and income.</li>\n<li>SF 36 Health Survey: a 36 item scale asking questions about physical health and mental health.
