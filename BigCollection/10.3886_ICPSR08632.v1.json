Primarily   designed to examine political participation and the role of voluntary   associations, the study also was stimulated by the growing literature   on the role of incentives and self-interest in organizational life and   political participation. The three sections of the questionnaire   focused on: (1) Common Cause, including the respondent's reasons for   joining, participation in internal activities, knowledge of the group's   position on important issues, and activities on behalf of the group,   (2) the respondent's views on national issues and political   institutions, and (3) respondent's social background (including   education, income, ethnicity, employment, age, and sex) and   participation in partisan and non-partisan activities besides Common   Cause. These dat\na permit a comparison of rank-and-file members of  Common Cause with those identified as activists in the organization."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.B.1.
