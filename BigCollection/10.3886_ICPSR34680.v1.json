In addition, the data will be used to inform other studies relating to regional travel. Data was collected using a blend of travel survey methods, and aided by computer-aided telephone interviewing (CATI) technology. Specifically, the project utilized\na one-call approach, where the household was recruited and travel details obtained for \"yesterday.\" The survey relied on the willingness of regional households to (1) provide demographic information about the household, its members and its vehicles and (2) report all locations visited by all household members for a specific 24-hour weekday period, including trip purpose, mode, and travel times. No incentives were offered in the conduct of this study; rather, it relied on the goodwill of regional residents to participate in the study. Survey work began with design in the fall of 2006, followed by the first recruitment mailing in November 2006. Given the low response to the mailout effort, the project shifted to a telephone-based design which was used from mid-February through the end of the study in early June 2007. The majority of surveys were obtained March through May of 2007. In total, 1,000 households participated in the study. The overall response rate was 16 percent, using survey research standards that take into account the sample that was dialed but for which eligibility was not confirmed. The ratio of completed households to all eligible households contacted (which is a more direct measurement of participation rates) was 59 percent."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"n/a"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The study design considerations were guided by the desire to maximize the number of completed surveys subject to budget constraints, with the minimum desired sample size being 1,000 households.
