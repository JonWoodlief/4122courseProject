The first major area of focus, e-communications, dealt with the nature, frequency, and quality of e-communications in the household.  All respondents were asked whether they owned a fixed or mobile telephone and other goods, and about the number of different types of mobile phone access in the household.  For those respondents with a personal mobile telephone, the survey asked about their mobile phone subscription services and how much they pay for mobile phone service as compared to two years ago.  Respondents with fixed telephone access expressed their opinion about their landline phone services, and those with no fixed telephone access were asked why they chose not to have a fixed phone line, and how often and why they use public payphones. In addition, respondents were asked which type of services the household used to receive television and Internet in their homes.  Respondents with Internet access were asked about accessing the Internet anytime and through what methods, the quality of their Internet service, and whether or not they had ever considered changing Internet service providers.  Those without broadband or any Internet access were asked why they had chosen not to have broadband access or any Internet access in their homes.  Fi\nnally, participants were asked about the confidentiality of the data they provide to telecom companies and social networking Web sites, use of social networking Web sites and telephone directories, whether they would consider buying a technology bundle, and their opinions about communication packages and e-communications services. For the second major area of focus, agriculture, the survey queried participants on the importance of and their knowledge about agriculture, including agricultural policy, who should address certain agricultural issues and which issues should be a main priority of the European Union (EU).  They were also asked to evaluate the EUâ€™s current and potential future actions on agriculture, the main responsibilities and roles of farmers, the most important reasons for maintaining agriculture in the EU, and whether or not they thought the current economic support measures in place for farmers are appropriate.  The respondents were also presented questions about agriculture in relation to climate change. The third major area of focus, geographical and labor market mobility, queried participants on their opinions about moving abroad, including whether they had personally done so for education or employment, and whether family or friends had ever lived or worked abroad. Respondents who lived or worked in another country were asked how often they commuted across the border, which country they had visited, the duration of their last stay, the general type of work done, and how they found that job. Respondents who were retired were asked about whether they envisage to work outside their country in the future, how soon they would be likely to work there, and the type of employment that interests them in that country.  In addition, they were asked to identify which countries they would prefer to work in, why they prefer these countries, the length of time they intend to work outside their own country, and whether they had taken any steps to move to another country.  If these respondents were moving to a specific country, the survey inquired whether friends or relatives could supply them with information about the country, whether they would move there alone or with other people, and how they would go about finding a job in another country. All respondents were asked whether they would move abroad if they were unemployed and having difficulties finding a job, the income they would need in order to take a job in another country, the type of commute to work preferred, and the chances of finding a job outside their own country.  Respondents were then asked about their knowledge of EURES, the Europe-wide network of public employment services, which employment service they would find useful, what reasons might encourage or discourage them from working abroad, and what difficulties they may encounter when working abroad.  The survey queried respondents on their opinion of pension payments and health care after retirement, reimbursement for medical treatment by their national health service, and their awareness and use of the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). For the fourth and final major area of focus, knowledge of antibiotic use, participants were asked if they had taken antibiotics within the last year, how they obtained the last course of antibiotics they used, and the reason for last taking antibiotics.  They were asked about their knowledge of antibiotic use, whether they had received any information about not taking antibiotics unnecessarily and the source of this information, whether this information had changed their views on antibiotics and how so, and which sources would provide trustworthy information on antibiotics. Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, nationality, occupation, marital status, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, Internet use, type and size of locality, region of residence, and language of\ninterview (in select countries)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"agricultural
