A national sample of 1214 adults were surveyed, including an oversample of 91 individuals with family members who are now serving in the United States armed forces or the United States reserves. Respondents were asked whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling his job as president, whether they approved of the way Bush was handling the war in Iraq, and the United States campaign again terrorism. Respondents were also asked to rate the national economy, if they followed the 2008 presidential campaign, and the first thing that came to mind when mentioning Barack Obama and Rudy Giuliani. They were also asked if they were registered to vote in their precinct, issues which were more important factors when deciding whom to vote for, and if they were satisfied with the candidates running for president. Respondent's opinions were also collected on whether they were satisfied with the Republican candidates running for nomination, whether their opinion was favorable, not favorable, undecided, or haven't heard enough about Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama. They were also asked whether the candidates cared about the needs of people like themselves, if they could deal wisely with an international crisis, and if they would make good decisions in dealing with foreign countries. Their opinion was also sought on how much confidence they had in the ability of the United States government to respond to natural disasters, how much progress had been made in rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, the condition of the system of roads and bridges in the area where they lived, whether federal spending on rebuilding and maintaining roads and bridges should be increased, decreased, or kept the same, and if they would be willing to pay more taxes to improve roads, bridges, and public structures. A series of questions were asked about professional football players. They were queried if they thought that when professional football players are suspended for misconduct off the field, if the National Football League is being too tough on them, if they had heard or read about the dog-fighting allegations against Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, if authorities treated Vick better than the average person because he was a professional athlete, and how interested they were in watching or following professional football. Demographic information includes sex, ag\ne, race, education level, marital status, household income, religious preference, religiosity, political party affiliation, if respondent was a born again Christian, and if there was anyone in the household between the ages of 18 and 24 years old."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush
