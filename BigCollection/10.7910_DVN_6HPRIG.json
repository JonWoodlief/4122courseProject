None of them had received a Teahouse invitation, a Level 4\r\nuser warning, or been blocked from editing at the time that they\r\nentered the study. Additionally, all users made at least one edit\r\nafter the day they were invited.

We\r\nmade the decision to include these edits in our counts, so as to\r\nmeasure the total level of participation undertaken by each\r\neditor. If a user in our study made article or talk page edits that\r\nwere subsequently deleted, we would use the deleted edit logs to\r\nidentify them, and increment the variables edits.all, edits.ns0,\r\nand edits.talk as appropriate. We decided that all edits drawn from\r\nthe deleted edit logs would be defined to have an edit persistence\r\nscore of 0, since they were deleted from Wikipedia.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>We “manually” merged these datasets together.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"contact-us\">\r\n<h3>Contact Us</h3>\r\n<p>For more details about the dataset, please see <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2998181.2998307\">our paper</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If you notice any bugs or issues with these data or code, please\r\ncontact <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://snehanarayan.com/\">Sneha Narayan</a> (<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"mailto:snehanarayan&#64;u.northwestern.edu\">snehanarayan&#64;u.northwestern.edu</a>) or the\r\nother authors of this paper.</p>\r\n</div>"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Computer and Information Science","Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Narayan, Sneha, Jake Orlowitz, Jonathan Morgan, Benjamin Mako Hill, and Aaron Shaw. 2017. “The Wikipedia Adventure: Field Evaluation of an Interactive Tutorial for New Users.” In Proceedings of the 20th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW ’17).
