A modeling approach was innovated to evaluate varietal performance in a large number of environments using the rice model ORYZA (v3). Modeled yields representing genotype by environment interactions (GEI) were used to classify the target population of environments (TPE) and analyze varietal yield and yield stability. Eight Green Super Rice (GSR) and three check varieties were evaluated across 3796 environments and 14 seasons in Southern Asia. Based on drought stress imposed on rainfed rice, environments were classified into nine TPEs. Relative to the check varieties, all GSR varieties performed well except GSR-IR1-5-S14-S2-Y2, with GSR-IR1-1-Y4-Y1, and GSR-IR1-8-S6-S3-Y2 consistently performing better in all TPEs. Varietal evaluation using ORYZA (v3) significantly corresponded to the evaluation based on actual MET data within specific sites, but not with considerably larger environments. ORYZA-based evaluation demonstrated the advantage of GSR varieties in diverse environments. This study substantiated that the modeling approach could be an effective, reliable, and advanced approach to complement MET in the assessment of varietal performance on spatial and temporal scales whenever quality soil and weather information are accessible. This approach can also be adopted to other crops or other rice producing domains in various locations with available weather information. \r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-05-18"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Agricultural Sciences","Other"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Manalo, Emmali"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-09-07"}]}},"files":[{"description":"Input files such as crop files, soil files, and experiment files, and other related data included in the calibration and validation, stability comparison, and variety performance over TPEs.","label":"Data.rar","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":87300,"dataFile":{"id":2873506,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/KVMGZO/9QRJV1","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/KVMGZO/9QRJV1","filename":"Data.rar","contentType":"application/octet-stream","filesize":298379,"description":"Input files such as crop files, soil files, and experiment files, and other related data included in the calibration and validation, stability comparison, and variety performance over TPEs.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:157079aaed3-61a2dc3bc7b7","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"34f7c5b916d339ced0e58ad9aca553ac","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"34f7c5b916d339ced0e58ad9aca553ac"}}}]}}}
