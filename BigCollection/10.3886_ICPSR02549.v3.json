Respondents were asked for their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the presidency, foreign policy, the economy, and United States relations with China, as well as their views on independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. The various charges and investigations facing Clinton were addressed, including the alleged affair between the president and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater, and improper poli\ntical fundraising tactics. Respondents were asked about their interest level in the media coverage of these investigations, who was to blame for these situations, and how well the White House was handling the investigations. A series of questions focused on the influence of the Chinese government on the United States government through campaign contributions, Clinton's decision to grant China permission to launch American communications satellites, and the upcoming June 1998 visit to China by Clinton. Those queried were asked for their opinions on Microsoft Corporation's use of illegal sales, marketing, and business tactics, Microsoft's role in the computer software industry and its effect on consumers, and the Justice Department's inquiry into the company. Additional topics covered the recent anti-trust case brought by the United States government and 20 states against Microsoft, and the respondent's use of and familiarity with computers, Windows software, and on-line poll participation. Background information on respondents includes age, race, ethnicity, sex, religion, marital status, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, family income, and age of children in household."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
