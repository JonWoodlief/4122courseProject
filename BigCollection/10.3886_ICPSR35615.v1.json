These surveys regularly monitor public opinion in the European Union (EU) member countries and consist of standard modules and special topic modules. The standard modules address attitudes towards European unification, institutions and policies, measurements for general socio-political orientations, as well as respondent and household demographics. The special topic modules address such topics as agriculture, education, natural environment and resources, public health, public safety and crime, and science and technology.</p>\n\n<p>This round of Eurobarometer surveys covers the following special topics: (1) the Europe 2020 strategy, (2) the financial and economic crisis, and (3) European citizenship. Respondents were queried on the importance of initiatives to exit the economic crisis, thoughts about EU objectives and opinions on the crisis timeline. Respondents were asked who is best able to take action against effects of the financial crisis, questions about the public deficit and opinions on reform efforts. Additionally, respondents were asked their expectations of the EU, positive results of the EU and which values best represent the EU.</p>\n\n<p>Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status, occupation, social class, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or mobile telephone and other goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.
