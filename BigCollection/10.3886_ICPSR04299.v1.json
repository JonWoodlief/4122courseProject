The program aimed to improve five core areas of  the young peoples' lives: substance use, mental health, schooling,  family functioning, and recidivism. Recruitment for the study occurred  at juvenile detention facilities in New York City. Intake staff  conducted screening interviews with the detainees. Those who reported  using substances at least 30 times in the previous 30 days, or who met  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition  (DSM IV) criteria for substance abuse or dependence were eligible for  selection. After the respondents and their families consented to  participate, the respondents were randomly assigned to treatment and  control groups. The treatment group went on to receive services from  APT, while control group subjects received no APT services but had  access to all other standard facilities and community based  services. The evaluation participants were interviewed at four time  points: at intake into the study in the juvenile detention facilities  (baseline), three months after release from detention (T1), nine  months after release from detention (T2), and 15 months after release  from detention (T3). Whenever subjects were interviewed outside of a  detention facility for T1, T2, and T3, study staff attempted to  collect urine samples which were tested for marijuana, cocaine,  amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), and opiates. Topics covered by the  interviews included substance use and treatment, physical health, risk  behaviors and disease prevention, mental and emotional health, living  situation and environment, crime and legal issues, school, work, income, and demographic characteristics."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"alcohol abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"correctional facilities (juveniles)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile inmates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"juvenile justice"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"marijuana"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"substance abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"substance abuse treatment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"youthful offenders"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"HMCA III.
