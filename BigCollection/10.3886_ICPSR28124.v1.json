The goal of this research was to determine the conditions under which a very specific assessment based, on-site consultation model of child care provider training  enhances the quality of the family home or child care classroom an\nd results in positive child change.</p>\n\n<p>The PFI consists of two main components, the assessment tools used to index quality -- The Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised, (ITERS), 2003, The Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale--Revised, (ECERS ), 1998, and Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS), 1989, measures developed by Harms, Clifford and Cryer, and the theory-based, collaborative, problem-solving model of consultation developed by Pat Wesley.

The study aimed to discover whether child care providers (both teachers and FCC home providers) who received services from a consultant trained to implement the PFI consultation model would:\n<strong>(1)</strong>\nprovide higher quality child care than those providers who did not receive services from a PFI-trained consultant,\n<strong>(2)</strong>\nprovide higher quality care than they provided before receiving the services, and\n<strong>(3)</strong>\ncontinue to provide higher quality care six months after the PFI-trained consultant services ended.</p>\n\n<p>The study also examined if\n<strong>(4)</strong>\nchildren who were cared for by providers who received services from a PFI-trained consultant would have better outcomes than children who were cared for by child care providers who did not receive services from a PFI-trained consultant, and if\n<strong>(5)</strong>\noutcomes for children in higher quality care, regardless of the type of intervention their provider received, would be higher than those in lower quality care.</p>\n\n<p>Three secondary focuses concerned possible moderators of the effectiveness of the intervention were also examined: provider education, experience, and level of professional motivation. The study looked at whether\n<strong>(6)</strong>\nthe providers' education could moderate the effects of the intervention,\n<strong>(7)</strong>\nif experience could moderate the effects of the intervention such that new providers made  greater gains or experienced providers understood more quickly how to integrate new knowledge into their teaching behavior, and\n<strong>(8)</strong>\nif teachers and FCC providers with higher levels of professional motivation would gain more from the intervention.</p>\n\n<p>Two secondary focuses concerned whether selected caregiver and treatment factors would mediate any association between treatment and quality:\n<strong>(9)</strong>\nIf the interventions received by teachers and FCC providers would influence their childrearing attitudes and contribute to the changes observed in the quality of their classrooms or FCC homes, and\n<strong>(10)</strong>\nwhether teachers and FCC providers who participated in a greater number of on-site consultant visits would make greater gains in child care quality than those who participated very little.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the conditions under which the PFI model would work were analyzed:\n<strong>(11)</strong>\nWould providers served by consultants who more closely adhere to the procedures of the PFI model show greater benefits of participation in the intervention, and\n<strong>(12)</strong>\nwould the PFI model be an effective for improving the quality of child care in both child care centers and family child care homes (regulated and unregulated); with providers from diverse cultural backgrounds; and in settings that\nserve a range of children with special needs, diverse language backgrounds, or from low-income families.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the study examined if PFI was a child care provider training model that is effective in a broad range of circumstances.</p>"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<p>The study design included randomization at two levels, consultants and child care providers (teachers and FCC providers). Consultants who agreed to participate in the study were randomly assigned to either a PFI Treatment group who implemented the PFI model of consultation or a control group who continued to offer quality enhancement activities as typically provided by their agencies. In other words, the controls were conducting \"business as usual.\" The control group was not a no-treatment group. About six months after random assignment of consultants, during which time the PFI consultants were trained on the model for one week of group training in North Carolina and then implemented the model with a pilot site, random assignment of classroom teachers and family child care providers took place in one of two ways. If an agency had both PFI and control consultants, providers were randomly assigned to PFI or control conditions.</p>\n\n<p>If an agency had only one consultant, whether PFI or control, or assigned providers to consultants within geographic areas where only a PFI or a control consultant was available, consultants received their study providers via random selection. Specifically, providers were randomly selected from lists of those seeking quality enhancement services from the participating agency and were asked to participate in the study. Thus, about 50 percent of study providers were randomly assigned to a consultant and about 50 percent were randomly selected to be in the study.</p>"}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ability"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"caregivers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child development"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"classroom environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"outcome evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"program evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school readiness"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"teachers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"CCEERC IV.
