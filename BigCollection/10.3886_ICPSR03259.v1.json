The  name of the program, \"TEST,\" is both a reference to testing and an  acronym representing the program's three objectives: (1) Testing to  identify drug-involved defendants before their first court appearance,  (2) Effective Sanctions when defendants on release were found to be  using drugs, and (3) Treatment referrals for drug-using defendants, as  needed. The program was based on the view that drug testing, when  closely linked to sanctions and treatment placements in response to  ongoing drug use, can reduce drug use among defendants on pretrial  release. The overall goal of the program was to deter drug use and its  adverse consequences among defendants on pretrial release. The  purposes of the evaluation were to describe the process of program  implementation and to document ODT's impact on sanctioning and  treatment. Data for this evaluation were gathered from official  records collected from the ODT database, which was maintained by the  Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC). Parts 1 and  2 contain data from fiscal year 1998 for initial drug tests and  subsequent drug tests, respectively. Data from fiscal year 1999 (Parts  3 and 4) were divided into two groups, depending on the model of ODT  implementation and the stage at which initial drug testing took place.  DOJ and AOUSC determined that districts could choose to implement the  program under either of two models. Model 1 (Part 3) followed the  original concept, namely, initial testing at the pre-bail stage. In  Model 2 (Part 4), the initial test was to occur as soon as possible  after the defendant's first court appearance, if he/she was being  released, but before release into the community. Variables unique to  Part 1 include date of birth, arrest date, initial hearing date,  hearing date, decision date, and release date.

(3) How much surveillance testing was done with  defendants on release? (4) Did ODT affect districts' responses to  defendants who tested positive on release?

The Administrative Office of the  United States Courts (AOUSC) oversaw program implementation in  participating districts and provided training and technical assistance  in areas such as selection of the drug test technology, recordkeeping,  and reporting. DOJ sent letters inviting participation in ODT to all  94 federal judicial districts. About one-third expressed interest, and  the Judicial Conference and DOJ selected 25 districts. One district  later dropped out. Each district was assured that their participation  in ODT would be compatible with and readily incorporated into pretrial  procedures and policies already in place. Data for this evaluation  were gathered from official records collected from the ODT database,  which was maintained by the AOUSC. Parts 1 and 2 contain data from  fiscal year 1998 for initial drug tests and subsequent drug tests,  respectively. Data from fiscal year 1999 (Parts 3 and 4) were divided  into two groups, depending on the model of ODT implementation. As  originally conceived and approved by the Judicial Conference in June  1996, ODT's operational concept or \"program model\" was to be the same  in all districts. The initial drug test was to occur at the pre-bail  stage, i.e., before the defendant's first court appearance. Thereafter,  defendants on release would undergo further drug testing. In some  districts, circumstances precluded drug testing before the defendant's  first court appearance. DOJ and AOUSC determined that districts could  choose to implement the program under either of two models. Model 1  (Part 3) followed the original concept, namely, initial testing at the  pre-bail stage. In Model 2 (Part 4), the initial test was to occur as  soon as possible after the defendant's first court appearance, if  he/she was being released, but before release into the community.
