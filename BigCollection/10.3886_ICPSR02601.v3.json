Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Another series of questions dealt with the claims that Clinton had an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Topics covered the importance of this alleged affair to the American people, the White Hous\ne's handling of the matter, who was to blame for the creation and perpetuation of the investigation, whether the testimony of Secret Service officers should be permitted, and the original reason for these investigations -- the Whitewater land dealings. Those queried were also asked for their opinions on the interests and actions of large corporations, including the debate between the public interest versus corporations' profit, special programs to hire and promote minorities, policies with respect to the environment, charitable donations, local community involvement, and who has the power to change the policies of big business. A series of questions was also posed regarding group investment of pension and retirement funds in the stock market by groups such as labor unions, colleges and universities, and religious organizations, and whether corporate social responsibility influenced group investment decisions. Respondents were asked whether they had stock investments, and whether social responsibility or annual reports were considered in making investment decisions, as well as whether they had received proxies or participated in shareholder meetings. In addition, respondents were queried regarding health care in America, including the amount, cost, and quality of health insurance coverage, comprehension of managed care plans and Health Maintenance Organizations, the money-saving goals of those plans, and pending legislation that would increase government regulation of health insurance plans. An additional question elicited respondents' attitudes toward unions and the United Auto Workers' strike against the General Motors Corporation. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, ethnicity, political party, political orientation, education, marital status, voter registration and participation history, family income, age of children in household, labor union membership, health care coverage, computer ownership, and investment in the stock market."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
