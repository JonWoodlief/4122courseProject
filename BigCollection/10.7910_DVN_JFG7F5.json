The IACD draws from peer-reviewed papers whose research was supported by four separate international aquaculture programs, which were developed by Hillary Egna including: 1. Pond Dynamics/Aquaculture CRSP (1982-1996); 2. Aquaculture CRSP (1996-2008); 3. AquaFish CRSP (2006-2013); and 4. AquaFish Innovation Lab (2013-Present). The IACD was compiled by two AquaFIsh Innovation Lab faculty and a student who reviewed both electronic and hard copies of journal articles. Every publication since 1983 was recorded with relevant publication information, including full names, gender of authors, and author position, with the percentage of unknowns being less than 1%. Gender of authors was recorded by Egna from having a personal connection to the author or by the lead authors themselves.
