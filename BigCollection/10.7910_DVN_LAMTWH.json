Questions concerned Village Identification, Characteristics of Village Headman, Settlement and Population, Institutions and Organizations, Technological Change and Important Events, Transportation, Land, Occupation, Social Structure and Welfare, Village Leadership, Income/Welfare Fluctuations and Ranking of Villages in the Tambon were collected.\r\n<br /><br />  Area selection: <br /><br /> The survey picks 16 communities in municipal areas of each amphoe under the ongoing Townsend’s project (Rural Survey). However, the numbers of communities in each amphoe vary between 1 to 18 communities; the Muang district has the largest number of communities, while other municipalities have no more than 4 communities. In order to cover the majority of both areas and community, the survey chooses 10 communities in Muang district and additional 2 commun\r\nities in other municipal areas in 3 amphoes in each province, totaling 96 communities. The choices of amphoes for urban survey are as follow:\r\n<br /><br />  1. Chachoengsao includes Muang district and 3 amphoes, namely Bangpakong, Bangkla and Phanomsarakam. Amphoe Bang Nam Priao and Amphoe Sanamchai have only 1 community and 2 villages that are semi-urban. In addition, there are villages included in the Townsend Rural Survey. Amphoe Khao Takiab is excluded for the reason that there is no muinicipality. <br /><br /> 2. Lop Buri the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Ban Mee, Chaibadan and Koksamrong. <br /><br /> 3. Buriram the survey covers A\r\nmphoe Muang, Prakonchai, Satuk and Nangrong <br /><br /> 4. Sisaket the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Kanthararom, Kanthonlak and Uthumpornpisai. Amphoe Prangkoo is excluded for the reason that it has only 1 community. Amphoe Posrisuwan is excluded for the reason that there is no municipality. <br /><br /> 5. Satun the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Langu, Tapae and Kuandon. <br /><br /> 6. Phrae the survey covers Amphoe Muang, Denchai, Rongkwang and Sungman. <br /><br />  Sample Selection: <br /><br\r\n/> 15 Household are selected from each community for interview. Due to time constraint, the survey decided to use the list of community fund’s member who applied for village/community fund from Government Housing B\r\nank and Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives. Each community fund must have members who are residents of that community no less than 95% of total household in the community. Each member is assigned a number and will be randomly selected. There are 1440 households (240 for each province) in total. The community heads (in the selected sample) are also interviewed; totaling 96 communities. For institutional survey, it is required prior to the community selection that such community must have village/community fund in operation. The village fund committees are interviewed by using Household Questionnaire Initial Survey. The survey includes 96 communities’ funds, saving groups, other group and 26 institutions/organizations of ROSCA.\r\n<br /><br />"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[]}},"files":[{"label":"About-NEWID.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":84828,"categories":["1.
