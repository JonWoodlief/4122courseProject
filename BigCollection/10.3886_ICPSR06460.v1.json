The first level   (\"H\" Record Type) contains 35 variables for each of 107,105   households. The second level (\"P\" Record Type) contains 58 variables   for each of 502,913 individuals residing in those households. (2)   Household records are padded with zeros in columns 112-123. (3) The   documentation for this collection is available in two formats:   WordPerfect 5.1 or ASCII DOS text derived from the WordPerfect file.   There are two WordPerfect files, containing: (a) the main body of the   codebook, Appendices A and B, and an index, and (b) Appendix C,   Detailed Occupation Codes. The ASCII DOS text version includes all of   these elements in a single file. Depending on printer and typesize   configurations, users may encounter differences in pagination and text   layout when printing the ASCII version as compared to the WordPerfect   file. The WordPerfect 5.1 version of the codebook is only available on   diskette and via FTP.

The manuscript census for 1880 consisted of about 1.2 million   enumeration pages, with 50 persons per page, recorded on 1,454 reels of   microfilm. The sampling strategy used for this collection was based on   the census page. A sample density of 1 person per 100 was chosen so   that a single sample point was randomly generated for every two census   pages. Sample points were chosen for inclusion in the collection only   if the individual selected was the first person listed in the dwelling.   Under this procedure each dwelling, family, and individual in the   population had a 1-in-100 probability of inclusion in the Public Use  Sample."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Census of Population, 1880 [United States]  Public Use Sample","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38907,"dataFile":{"id":2641058,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Census of Population, 1880 [United States]  Public Use Sample","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Diskette D00180","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":38907,"dataFile":{"id":2641059,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Diskette D00180","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
