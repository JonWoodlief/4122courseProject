It integrates and updates previous data collection efforts by Ribeiro & De Grazia (1997-2002) and Avritzer & Wampler (2004). The census includes all Brazilian cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants from 1989 through 2012 and identifies those that have implemented Participatory Budgeting. The resulting data set contains approximately 500 cities for six time periods, divided into four-year intervals. The PB census is geolocated and easily integrates with existing data sets maintained by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (<a href=\"http://www.ipea.gov.br/portal/index.php?option=com_content&Itemid=61\">IPEA</a>), the Superior Electoral Court (<a href=\"http://english.tse.jus.br/\">TSE</a>), and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (<a href=\"http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/\">IBGE</a>).\r\n\r\nThe census uses <a href=\"http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/1097_DG-25_bf.pdf\">Yves Sintomer's five criteria</a> to define participatory budgeting, and is created using a two-step methodology. First, internet research is conducted to identify elements that indicate the potential presence of participatory budgeting in a city. Next, each potential PB site is contacted by phone to determine whether or not the city has implemented participatory budgeting. The data set uses a four-year coding scheme that follows the electoral cycle. A city is coded as having implemented participatory budgeting if it has completed at least two cycles of participatory budgeting. This method was used twice to conduct a census: first in the spring of 2008 and a second time in the spring of 2012. See \"Full PB Census 1989 to 2012.\")\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Spada together with Brian Wampler, Mike Touchton, and Denilson Coelho, implemented a more detailed telephonic survey in the census to obtain data on the variety of designs of participatory budgeting. The results of the new survey are included below. (See \"PB Census 2012 - variety of PB survey.\")\r\n\r\nIn 2016 Spada has replicated the census for a third time thanks to the support of the EMPATIA project and in collaboration with Wagner de Melo Romão, Brian Wampler, and Mike Touchton. Many additional Brazilian scholars have provided comments and support. The research is funded by <a href=\"https://www.empatia-project.eu/\">the EMPATIA project</a> and by a grant from the São Paulo Research Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.fapesp.br/en/\">FAPESP</a>). The data is currently being reviewed and after a short embargo period will be released (December 2018). Below it is possible to access the previous iteration of the census with data up to 2012. A sneak preview of the 2016 dataset shows a further decline in participatory budgeting implementation.\r\n\r\nThe data is currently being used in several ongoing research projects.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about these Brazilian Participatory data sets, please contact <a href=\"mailto:spadayale@gmail.com?subject=Brazilian PB data sets\">Paolo Spada</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to cite these data sets</strong>\r\n\r\nUse of these data sets is governed by <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\">the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial-Sharelike 3.0 Unported license (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0).</a> \r\n\r\nPlease use the following APSA style format when citing these data sets: \r\n\r\nSpada, P. 2012. \"Brazilian Participatory Budgeting Census: 1989-2012.\" Available at: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EDSNJS\">http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EDSNJS</a> (DATE OF ACCESS).\r\n\r\nSpada, P., Wampler, B., Touchton, M. & Coelho, D. 2012. \"Variety of Brazilian Participatory Budgeting Designs: 2012.\" Available at: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EDSNJS\">http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EDSNJS</a> (DATE OF  ACCESS).\r\n\r\nCitation in Text:\r\n\r\n(Spada 2012)\r\n\r\n(Spada, Wampler, Touchton, and Coelho 2012)"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"participatory budgeting"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"citizen participation"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"participatory governance"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"political participation"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Richards, Robert"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2017-10-08"},{"typeName":"relatedDatasets","multiple":true,"typeClass":"primitive","value":["Spada, P. 2012. \"Brazilian Participatory Budgeting Census: 1989-2012.\" Available at:\r\n<a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/content/brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census/\">http://participedia.net/en/content/brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census/</a> (DATE OF ACCESS).","Spada, P., Wampler, B., Touchton, M. & Coelho, D. 2012. \"Variety of Brazilian Participatory Budgeting Designs: 2012.\" Available at: <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/content/brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census/\">http://participedia.net/en/content/brazilian-participatory-budgeting-census/</a> (DATE OF  ACCESS)."]}]}},"files":[{"description":"Covers the census from 1989 to 2012, including a legend","label":"Full PB census 1989 to 2012.tab","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":129144,"dataFile":{"id":3056497,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/EDSNJS/U3IFYZ","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EDSNJS/U3IFYZ","filename":"Full PB census 1989 to 2012.tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":218124,"description":"Covers the census from 1989 to 2012, including a legend","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:15efdfbd351-c338c38af86b","originalFileFormat":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","originalFormatLabel":"MS Excel (XLSX)","UNF":"UNF:6:2duXF8yXZLu9WBCrd1jpCw==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"054da745424712667608921fd690634a","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"054da745424712667608921fd690634a"}}},{"description":"Includes responses to the spring 2012 survey with results from the more detailed telephonic survey conducted later in 2012.
