Children were selected for participation in the study if they lived in either poor and deteriorating housing or public housing, had a low family income, and had parents with less than a high school education who worked in an unskilled or semiskilled occupation. Half of the children took part in an early educational intervention program prior to school entrance, and the other half comprised both a local control group and a distal control group. The intervention program consisted of a ten-week summer preschool program for the two or three summers prior to the first grade, plus weekly home visits during the remainder of the year. The program focused on two broad classes of variables: attitudes relating to achievement (including motivation to achieve in school, persistence, delay of gratification, interest in school-type activities, and identification with achieving role models), and school performance (including learning of basic concepts, perceptual discrimination, and language development).\r\n<br />"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"<br />  Data from this study include tests of intellectual development prior to, during, and after intervention;
