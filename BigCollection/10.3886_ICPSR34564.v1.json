Contextual analysis, conducted through site visits, was necessary to identify variances in court/probation processing and case treatment and was a prerequisite to the collection of data. In Santa Clara and San Francisco counties, the research team interviewed agency and community-based staff participating in the programs, observed court hearings, and collected agency protocols and reports. In Contra Costa County, staff interviewed the presiding juvenile judge and probation staff.
