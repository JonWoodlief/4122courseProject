From the 2010 study, researchers analyzed the connection between community attachment and economic growth and found that cities with the highest levels of attachment had the highest rate of GDP growth. Social offerings, openness and beauty are far more important than peoples' perceptions of the economy, jobs or basic services in creating a lasting emotional bond between people and their community.;Subject: Study Level Error Note, Notes: This collection includes Excel files produced by CPANDA, one for each year.

This type of weighting corrects for over or under representation of population groups (such as minority groups or college age adults) who may be harder to reach or participate less in sample surveys. The data across the Knight Foundation Communities were then weighted by population size to put each community into the correct proportion relative to the other communities. For 2010, each community survey was weighted to community-specific parameters for age, sex, race, ethnicity (Hispanic/non-Hispanic) and education. These weights correct for non-response and non-coverage to create unbiased, representative results. Data from the three years have the same two weight variables: CSWEIGHT should be used when analyzing data from one community, comparing results (i.e., means, percentages) across two or more communities, or when conducting inferential statistical tests (i.e., significance testing).
