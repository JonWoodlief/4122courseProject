It is shown that the widely used modulation scheme with orthogonal frequency division (OFDM) has a number of drawbacks, which can lead to a decrease in system performance. Alternative technologies for generating signals are presented, in particular, a technology based on windowed signal processing (W-OFDM), a technology based on time division (w-OFDM); UFMC technology and others to eliminate the disadvantages of OFDM technology. New points of view are proposed on the use of multi-carrier transmission technology in the form of multiplexing with orthogonal frequency division (in order to increase the security of modern wireless broadband access communication systems from external and internal threats), a class of non-linear discrete cryptographic sequences to form a physical data carrier - signal. It is shown that the use of such signals will improve the security of these systems from inserting (imposing) false messages into the system, falsifying messages, as well as ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data, receiving noise immunity and secrecy of the system."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Computer and Information Science"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"noise immunity, information security, broadband access, signal, integrity, noise immunity, cellular communication, frequency division, interference, peak factor."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"isbn"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"978-0-9989826-5-6 "}},{"publicationIDType":{"typeName":"publicationIDType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"doi"},"publicationIDNumber":{"typeName":"publicationIDNumber","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LJMXAH"}}]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ASC Academic Publishing, Minden, Nevada, USA"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2018-12-07"}]}},"files":[{"label":"ASC Academic Publishing 978-0-9989826-5-6_Chapter 8.pdf","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":148014,"dataFile":{"id":3324581,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/29NWLY/3X7L00","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/29NWLY/3X7L00","filename":"ASC Academic Publishing 978-0-9989826-5-6_Chapter 8.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":525898,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1678aaed6f2-e500260bc48b","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"49a6db4570cb556a525cd57ed2dad49c","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"49a6db4570cb556a525cd57ed2dad49c"}}}]}}}
