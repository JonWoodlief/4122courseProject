To choose the appropriate file/weight for your analysis, first decide which two or more points in time are the focus of your analysis. The analysis could pertain to two points in  time (e.g., spring-kindergarten and fall-first grade, or spring kindergarten and spring-first grade), three points in time (any three of fall-kindergarten, spring-kindergarten, fall-first grade, and spring-first grade), or four points in time (all four rounds of data). For example, if the analysis uses spring-kindergarten and fall-first grade data, then the appropriate weight would be one that begins with C23 (den\noting child-level data from round 2 AND round 3). Second, consider the source of the data, which also affects the choice of the weight, based on whether the data were collected through the child assessments, parent interviews, or teacher questionnaires A or B.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n\n<p>K-1 longitudinal weights are used to produce estimates of differences between two or more rounds of data collection spanning across both kindergarten and first grade.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Less complex decision examples involving two rounds of data collection are as follows:</strong>\n(1) Estimates of the differences in children's mean assessment scores between spring kindergarten and spring first grade would use C24CW0 (2) estimates of the difference in social rating scores as reported by parents during the same time period would use C24PW0.</li>\n<li><strong>A more complex decision example involving more than two rounds of data follows:</strong>\nExamining whether gains children make in their reading  knowledge and skills during the kindergarten year and from the end of  kindergarten to the end of first grade are related to parents' and teachers' beliefs about kindergarten readiness and parental educational expectations. In this case, the weight Y2COMW0 would be appropriate.</li>\n</ol>"},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Early Childhood Longitudinal Study [United States] Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":36399,"dataFile":{"id":2619655,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Early Childhood Longitudinal Study [United States] Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
