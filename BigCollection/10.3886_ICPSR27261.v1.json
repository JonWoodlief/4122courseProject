United States military academies and for-profit institutions were excluded. Data were collected in conjunction with the 2004 BJS Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies. The survey instrument was patterned after the BJS Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics survey. Data were collected describing campus law enforcement agencies, including personnel, expenditures and pay, operations, equipment, computers and information systems, policies, and special programs. BJS conducted an earlier survey of campus law enforcement agencies, covering the 1994-1995 school year.

For agencies not responding to the full survey, an abbreviated survey instrument was used, giving agencies the opportunity to provide data on type and number of personnel, use of sworn officers, use of armed officers, physical campus characteristics, and number of crimes reported to campus law enforcement authorities.
