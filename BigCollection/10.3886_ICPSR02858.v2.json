Specifically,  the goals of the study were (1) to determine the effectiveness of  DVIP, (2) to compare victims' perceptions of program satisfaction and  other program elements between the Alexandria Domestic Violence  Intervention Program and domestic violence victim support services in  Virginia Beach, Virginia, (3) to examine the factors related to  abusers who repeatedly abuse their victims, and (4) to report the  findings of attitudinal surveys of the Alexandria police department  regarding the mandatory arrest policy. Data were collected from four  sources. The first two sources of data were surveys conducted via  telephone interviews with females living in either Alexandria,  Virginia (Part 1), or Virginia Beach, Virginia (Part 2), who were  victims of domestic violence assault incidents in which the police had  been contacted. These surveys were designed to describe the services  that the women had received, their satisfaction with those services,  and their experience with subsequent abuse. For Part 3 (Alexandria  Repeat Offender Data), administrative records from the Alexandria  Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) were examined in order to  identify and examine the factors related to abusers who repeatedly  abused their victims. The fourth source of data was a survey  distributed to police officers in Alexandria (Part 4, Alexandria  Police Officer Survey Data) and was developed to assess police  officers' attitudes regarding the domestic violence arrest policy in  Alexandria. In four rounds of interviews for Part 1 and three rounds  of interviews for Part 2, victims answered questions regarding the  location where the domestic violence incident occurred and if the  police were involved, their perceptions of the helpfulness of the  police, prosecutor, domestic violence programs, hotlines, and  shelters, their relationship to the abuser, their living arrangements  at the time of each interview, and whether a protective order was  obtained. Also gathered was information on the types of abuse and  injuries sustained by the victim, whether she sought medical care for  the injuries, whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the  incident(s), whether the victim h\nad been physically abused or  threatened, yelled at, had personal property destroyed, or was made to  feel unsafe by the abuser, if any other programs or persons provided  help to the victim and how helpful these additional services were, and  whether a judge ordered services for the victim or abuser. After the  initial interviews, in subsequent rounds victims were asked if they  had had any contact with the abuser since the last interview, if they  had experienced any major life changes, if their situation had  improved or gotten worse and if so how, and what types of assistance  or programs would have helped improve their situation. Demographic  variables for Part 3 include offenders' race, sex, age at first  criminal nondomestic violence charge, and age at first domestic  violence charge. Other variables include charge number, type,  initiator, disposition, and sentence of nondomestic violence charges,  as well as the conditions of the sentences, imposed days, months, and  years, effective days, months, and years, type of domestic violence  case, victim's relationship to offender, victim's age, sex, and race,  whether alcohol or drugs were involved, if children were present at  the domestic violence incident, the assault method used by the  offender, and the severity of the assault. For Part 4, police officers  were asked whether they knew what a domestic violent incident was,  whether arresting without a warrant was considered good policy,  whether they were in favor of domestic violence policy as a police  response, whether they thought domestic violence policy was an  effective deterrent, whether officers should have discretion to  arrest, and how much discretion was used to handle domestic violence  calls. The number and percent of domestic violence arrests made in the  previous year, percent of domestic violence calls that involved mutual  combat, and the number of years each respondent worked with the  Alexandria, Virginia, police department are included in the file.  Demographic variables for Part 4 include the age and gender of each respondent."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The problem of violence against women,  particularly domestic violence and intimate partner violence, has  received increasing attention over the last few years. Previous  research has shown that arresting domestic violence offenders resulted  in fewer incidents of subsequent violence. These findings led to  widespread adoption of mandatory arrest policies by police departments.  Recent studies, however, have noted that the evaluations of the impact  of mandatory arrest policies had largely been conducted without  monitoring the domestic violence prosecution processes and their  outcomes. Furthermore, these studies showed that there was little or  no evidence that (1) arrest, in the absence of other sanctions,  reduced subsequent violence by the offender, and (2) court-mandated  treatment of domestic violence offenders was effective in reducing  recidivism rates. Research has also noted that police do not operate  independently of other elements of the criminal justice system.  Moreover, in cases of domestic violence, community advocacy  organizations play an important role in service provision. There is  some evidence that coordinated responses to domestic violence were  effective in producing positive outcomes for victims. Thus,  communities have sought to develop coordinated responses to domestic  violence, involving police, prosecutors, judges, and community  advocates. These projects have typically developed pro-arrest  policies, prosecution and sentencing guidelines, and counseling and  education programs for court-mandated batterers. One popular method  for implementing comprehensive coordinated approaches has been the  formation of community intervention projects that are primarily  staffed by battered women's advocates. These programs usually have  several elements in common, such as the provision of services to  victims and b\natterers, including court-ordered treatment, and the  presence of active coordination between the local police department  and prosecutor's office. However, there has been relatively little  research on any of these coordinated programs. Generally, this study  sought to evaluate Alexandria, Virginia's Domestic Violence  Intervention Program (DVIP), which is a coordinated community response  to domestic violence. Specifically, the goals of this study were (1)  to determine the effectiveness of DVIP, (2) to compare program  satisfaction and other program elements between the Alexandria,  Virginia, Domestic Violence Intervention Program and domestic violence  victim support services in Virginia Beach, Virginia, (3) to examine  the factors related to abusers who repeatedly abuse their victims, and  (4) to report the findings of attitudinal surveys of the Alexandria police department regarding the mandatory arrest policy."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were collected from four sources. The first  two sources of data were surveys conducted via telephone interviews  with females living in either Alexandria, Virginia (Part 1), or  Virginia Beach, Virginia (Part 2), who were victims of domestic  violence assault incidents in which the police had been contacted. The  surveys were designed to determine the services that the women had  received, their satisfaction with those services, and their experience  with subsequent abuse. Initial interviews of victims in Alexandria  began in May 1996, with three rounds of subsequent interviews  conducted. On average, the first round of (initial) interviews was  conducted about two months after the incident. Round 2 was conducted  about one month after Round 1, Round 3 about three months after Round  2, and Round 4 about nine months after Round 3. The initial interviews  of Virginia Beach victims began in March 1997 with two rounds of  subsequent interviews conducted. On average, the first round of  initial interviews began about one month after the incident. Round 2  was conducted about one month after Round 1, and Round 3 about two to  three months after Round 2. The time interval between Rounds 1 and 2  was comparable to the interval in Alexandria. However, the interval  between Rounds 2 and 3 was, approximately, 23 days longer in  Alexandria than in Virginia Beach. Due to differences concerning the  way in which researchers were allowed access to potential  participants, recruitment procedures were different in the two  localities. In Alexandria, a letter was prepared by the research team  under the signature of the Coordinator of the Office on Women's  Domestic Violence Program. The letter introduced the study and  indicated that the women would be contacted by a research  team. Volunteers from the Alexandria Domestic Violence Intervention  Program (DVIP) gave the letters to female domestic violence victims at  the time their cases were heard in court. Once the women's court  hearings were completed, DVIP volunteers returned the incident reports  to the Office on Women's Domestic Violence Program. These reports were  copied every few weeks, depending on the caseload for that particular  time period. These forms were then used by the interviewers to contact  the victims to inquire about participation in the study. Once contact  was established, the interviewers read from a script that explained  the purpose of the study and requested the victim's participation for  the first interview. The procedures followed in Virginia Beach, which  was used as a comparison site, were different from those followed in  Alexandria for two reasons. First, the researchers were not allowed to  contact victims directly to solicit their participation in the study  because the City Attorney's office felt that releasing the names and  phone numbers of the victims would violate their privacy. Secondly,  the length of time between abusive incidents and the victim's court  appearance was much longer in Virg\ninia Beach than in Alexandria, and  there was no systematic volunteer court accompaniment program in  Virginia Beach. Thus, there was no way to inform potential  participants that the study was proceeding. Since detectives from the  Virginia Beach Police Department's domestic violence unit regularly  contacted all domestic violence victims who had called police, the  research team decided that these officers would introduce the study to  victims and solicit their participation. A script was prepared for the  detectives to read to the victims. If the victim agreed to participate  in the study, the detective recorded the victim's name and phone  number on a list of potential study participants. These forms were  faxed to the interviewers, who then contacted the victims. The initial  interview for both sites was an abbreviated one, which was conducted  at the time the victims agreed to participate in the study. Subsequent  interviews for both sites were all conducted using the same, more  detailed questionnaire. There was only one major difference between  the interview forms used for the two localities. Since there was no  domestic violence program in Virginia Beach that could easily be  identified, the women there were asked about the helpfulness of the  police department's domestic violence unit, rather than the domestic  violence program. For Part 3 (Alexandria Repeat Offender Data)  administrative records from the Alexandria Criminal Justice  Information System (CJIS) were examined in order to identify and  examine the factors related to abusers who repeatedly abused their  victims. In 1993 the tracking of domestic violence cases was  incorporated into the CJIS. Alexandria's CJIS is an offender-based  system used by the courts to track defendants. Once domestic violence  cases are identified by the victim-witness office, they are entered  into the system with a code indicating that they are domestic violence  cases. The study staff met with the Victim Services Coordinator and  the CJIS administrator to determine the cases and variables needed for  the purposes of the study. The city then enlisted the consultants who  program the CJIS database to pull cases with the required data  elements and place them into files that could be used by the project  staff for analysis. Researchers examined the following: (1) domestic  violence incidents occurring during the time period from January 1993  to June 1996, (2) offenses other than domestic violence, committed by  domestic violence defendants from January 1, 1990, through June of  1996, and (3) the characteristics of one-time and repeat offenders.  The fourth source of data was a survey distributed to police officers  in Alexandria (Part 4, Alexandria Police Officer Survey Data). The  survey was developed to assess police officers' attitudes regarding  the domestic violence arrest policy in Alexandria. The survey was  administered during roll calls in the fall of 1996 by the sergeant in  charge of the domestic violence unit. A total of 133 officers and detectives completed the survey."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In four rounds of interviews for Part 1 and three  rounds of interviews for Part 2, victims answered questions regarding  the location where the domestic violence incident occurred and if the  police were involved, their perceptions of the helpfulness of the  police, prosecutor, domestic violence programs, hotlines, and  shelters, their relationship to the abuser, their living arrangements  at the time of each interview, and whether a protective order was  obtained.
