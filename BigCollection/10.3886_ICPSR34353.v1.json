Specifically, a database was built comprised of all Medicaid enrollees and claims in the states that share in common both adverse minority health outcomes and the historical roots of racial health disparities in the South.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Setting and Participants.</strong>\nA 100 percent sample of four years 2004-2007 of Medicaid Analytic Extract (MAX-file) data (plus Medicare-linked claims for dual-eligibles) from fourteen southern states, representing 3.8 to 5.4 million persons each year (one-third of all United States Medicaid enrollees, nearly half [48 percent] of African American and 21 percent of Latino Medicaid enrollees in the United States) was obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  This region is the epicenter of the Black-White health disparities epidemic, and has also experienced a recent and rapid influx of Latino immigrants.  This project provided support for personnel and infrastructure needed to efficiently organize and analyze these data to support minority investigators.  The HBCU-based team had extensive previous experience training health services researchers (especially minority investigators) to use Medicaid claims data for research.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Specific Aims: Using Medicaid Claims Data</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>To build a Medicaid claims dataset (including socieconomic, contextual, and geospatial analytic variables, NDC cross-walk data and therapeutic class codes, as well as certain Medicare data for dual-eligibles) to support projects focused on the intersection between disparities research and comparative effectiveness research in clinically and socially complex patient populations.</p></li>\n<li><p>To create an efficient process for assisting non-Morehouse investigators to develop research protocols, analysis plans, CMS data re-use requests, and analytic files for collaborative research.</p></li>\n<li><p>To train, develop, cultivate, and support emerging minority investigators (especially at Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions) as independently-funded health services researchers who are increasingly proficient in multivariate analysis of Medicaid and Medicare claims data.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cultivate comparative effectiveness and disparities research collaborations with Georgia Tech experts in mathematics, complexity science, simulation modeling, and interactive computing.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Relevance.</strong>\nMedicaid patients are characterized by clinical and social complexity -- the very characteristics which often exclude them from clinical trials and yet drive health disparities. This Medicaid-based dataset populates studies that help users understand how local area, provider-level, and patient-level differences in treatment (natural experiments in comparative effectiveness) influence clinical and economic outcomes.  Variation implies that disparities are not inevitable. The comparative impact of this natural variation can be measured in meaningful outcomes such as emergency department visits, hospital admissions, inpatient bed-days, deaths, and total Medicaid expenditures, as well as community-level disparity rate-ratios.  Medicaid data allow users to follow a complex patient (e.g., comorbid diabetes and schizophrenia or COPD and CHF) from treatment to outcomes through ev\nery billable service in the health care system (i.e., from doctor's visit to lab tests to prescriptions to emergency room visits or hospital admissions).  Morehouse School of Medicine has a unique ability to develop a new cadre of minority investigators to conduct and interpret the results of health services research with a racially sensitive, culturally competent perspective.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Overview.</strong>\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services produces the MAX-files from Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data submitted by each state, with some data cleaning and validation by CMS sub-contractors before data are released to researchers.</p>\n\n<p>The MAX-file data from CMS were loaded onto encrypted, secure servers at Morehouse School of Medicine. Research analytic files were created for each sub-project, including sickle cell disease, diabetes and schizophrenia; asthma; dementia; and congestive heart failure.  For specific sub-projects, contextual variables from census data or area resource file were linked by county FIPS code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Access.</strong>\nThe data cannot be made publicly available.
