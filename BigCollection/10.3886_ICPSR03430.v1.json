The poll also attempted to assess how these  allegations had influenced respondents' feelings about the Catholic  Church in general. Respondents were asked if they had heard of the  scandal surrounding Catholic priest John Geoghan, a Boston clergyman  accused of molesting over 80 children, if the case had concerned them,  how serious a problem they viewed sexual abuse of children by priests  to be, and how often they though\nt that sexual abuse by priests  occurred. Those queried were then asked if they thought the Catholic  Church was doing enough to address the problem of sexual abuse by  priests, if they thought the recent allegations had harmed the overall  reputation of the Catholic Church, if they thought Catholic priests  were more likely then other men to sexually abuse children, and if  they believed that the policy of the Catholic Church prohibiting  priests from marrying contributed to the problem. Finally, respondents  were asked a series of questions designed to assess their opinions of  the Catholic Church's past responses to allegations of sexual  misconduct and their ideas on how the Church should respond in the  future. They were asked whether they agreed with the church's response  of transferring a priest who had been accused of sexual abuse to  another parish, whether they believed that the church should inform  parishioners and/or police if a parish priest was accused of sexually  abusing a child, and whether the church should be required by law to  inform police or parishioners. The results of the poll were announced  on the ABC television program \"Nightline.\" Background information on  respondents includes age, gender, political party, education,  religion, typical attendance of religious services, and  ethnicity. Catholic respondents were also asked how much they trusted their own parish priest around children."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Catholic Church"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Catholic priests"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"children"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sexual abuse"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
