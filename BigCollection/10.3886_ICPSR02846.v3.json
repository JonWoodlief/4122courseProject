Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and the United States Congress. They were also asked to recall the April 1999 high school shooting in Colorado, as well as the recent\noffice shootings in Georgia and Alabama, and the previous week's shooting at a Los Angeles, California, community center and day camp. Their views were sought on the reasons behind those shootings and whether the incidents could have been prevented. A series of questions addressed the issue of gun ownership and gun control in the United States, including the depth of the Second Amendment. On the topic of gun control, respondents were asked whether they believed that regulations should be stricter, including requiring gun manufacturers to put trigger locks/safety devices on guns, extending the waiting period for background checks, requiring a three-day waiting period between when a gun is bought and when it is sold, and requiring gun owners to register each firearm with the government. Those queried were asked whether stricter laws would reduce violent crime. Additional questions addressed respondents' views regarding bans on assault weapons and all handguns, permitting individuals to carry concealed weapons, the National Rifle Association (NRA), and whether Congress would enact stricter gun control laws during 1999. Background information on respondents includes age, sex, race, education, religion, voter registration and participation history, political party, political orientation, Hispanic descent, marital status, gun ownership, computer access, stock market investments, age of children in household, and family income."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.1.
