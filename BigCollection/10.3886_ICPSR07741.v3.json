One or more members of selected families provided information regarding use of health services, the cost of these services, and how this cost was met for the calendar year 1963. Information on health attitudes and beliefs was also collected for the head of each household (or spouse). In addition, data were gathered from hospitals, employers, and insuring organizations concerning hospi\ntalizations and insurance coverage reported in the family interviews. These data were then combined with family reports to achieve the best possible estimates for hospitalization and health insurance coverage variables.
