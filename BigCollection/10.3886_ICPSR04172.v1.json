The primary investigators attempted to measure  empirically the concept of globalization. These data offer temporal  and international coverage, a theory-driven classification of  globalization indicators, and standardizations of these indicators.  Using large samples of the world's countries for mid-decade years in  the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, these data amass three interrelated  dimensions and their corresponding measures of globalization, i.e.,  economic, cultural, and political. Measures of political globalization  included each nation's participation in international treaties,  intergovernmental organizations, and international non-governmental  organizations, as well as each nation's total number of embassies,  sent and received. The economic measures examined each nation's inflow  of foreign direct investment, the balance of international income  credit and debit payments, the balance of international services  income credit and debit payments, and the balance of international  imports and exports. The cultural measures compiled each nation's  migration stock, the import of foreign newspapers and periodicals, the  import of foreign books, and the amount of international mail received  and dispatched. Descriptive characteristics collected included each  country's United Nations Country Code, year of independence and  dissolution, total population, and gross domestic product (GDP). Part  1 of this collection consists of a large sample of the world's  nation-states. Part 2 is a subset of Part 1 which contains only those  countries in the sample that had populations of at least one million people in 1995."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"globalization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international economics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"world politics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international relations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international markets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cultural influences"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XI.C.
