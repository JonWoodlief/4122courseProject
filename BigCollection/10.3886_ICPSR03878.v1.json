The  target age range for the children was 19 to 35 months. Respondents were  queried on the number of children present in the household between the  ages of 12 months and 3 years, those children's dates of birth, their  sex, whether there were vaccination records for the children, whether  those records were accessible, whether the respondent was the adult in  the household most knowledgeable about the vaccinations, and whether the  respondent accompanied the children to more than 50 percent of their  vaccinations. For each child in the household, information was gathered  on whether he or she had received all of the recommended vaccinations,  and the number of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis shots (DTP or DT),  polio vaccinations, measles vaccinations, meningitis or Haemophilus  Influenzae type B (HIB) shots, varicella (chicken pox) vaccinations, and  hepatitis B (Hep B) shots each child had received. Further information  was obtained about additional vaccinations the child may have received  to combat diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, yellow fever, and  malaria, the child's health care providers, the number of doctors that  had performed vaccinations, and whether the measles vaccination was  strictly for measles or for the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combination.  Once parental consent was obtained, health care providers were queried  on the vaccination records for each child whose vaccination information  was gathered from parents. Health care providers were queried on the  type and the level of detail of the vaccination records for each child,  the dates and types of vaccinations administered, the date of each  child's first visit to that provider regardless of reason, the date of  the child's most recent visit to that provider regardless of reason, and  the type of care the provider gave to the child. Health care provider  respondents were asked to describe their facility, to give their  position within the facility, the child's date of birth according to  their records, whether the child was known by another last name, and to  provide a list of any additional health care providers for that child.  Demographic information provided by the parents or guardians includes  the number of people living in the household, the number of people over  and under 18 in the household, the number of children under the age of  12 months, ethnicity of the child and respondent, marital status of the  respondent, respondent's relationship to the child, respondent's  educational level or that of the child's mother, the date of birth of  the child's mother, household income, and whether the child was living at the same address as when he or she was born."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"child health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health care delivery"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"immunization"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vaccines"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR IX.
