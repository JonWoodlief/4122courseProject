This study expands on the 1992, 1996, and 2001 CJSSC by collecting a nationally representative sample of bench and jury trials concluded in 156 urban, suburban, and rural counties. Prior iterations of the CJSSC focused on general civil cases concluded by bench or jury trial in a sample of the nation's 75 most populous counties. The 2005 CJSSC was designed and carried out by the National Center for State Courts. Westat designed the national sampling framework for this survey. The data collection produced two datasets. The first contains information on general civil (tort, contract, and real property) cases disposed of by bench or jury trial in a national sample of counties in 2005. Detailed case level information was obtained on these trials, including types of civil cases litigated at trial, characteristics of litigants involved in trials, who wins in trials, compensatory award amounts, punitive damages, case processing times, and post-trial litigation. The other data file contains aggregate information on the number of general civil trial and nontrial dispositions that occurred in 2005 in CJSCC counties that had the capacity to provide these data.

Each PSU was assigned to 1 of 55 strata. The first 5 strata contained the 75 most populous counties that were subject to and included in the previous civil trial study.

The replicate weights were created using the jackknife method and the user must specify the JKn variance estimation procedure when using WESTVAR PC. Note on the JKn and FPC factors required for JKn variance estimation: In order for the JKn procedure to work correctly, it is necessary to attach two files of factors to the WESTVAR PC file. These are the FPC and JKn factors. Both files are included under the Civil Justice Survey of State Courts, 2005 project and should be downloaded and attached to the WESTVAR PC data file. In addition, the degrees of freedom should be set at 78 (132 replicate weights minus 54 noncertainty strata) for the national sample.
