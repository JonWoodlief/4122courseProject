Additionally, demographic variables and sampling weights are included in the file. The Demographic Section is divided into four parts: residence data, sample person data, household data, and head of household data. The residence data include information on where the respondent lives, size of place, and total number of persons in the household and/or family. Variables in the sample person data cover age, birth date, sex, race, state of birth, marital status, national origin or ancestry, educational status, and job- and work-related questions. Household data are concerned with characteristics such as total number of rooms in the residence, number of bedrooms, type of kitchen facilities, whether there are running water facilities in the household, and type of heating and cooling systems. Additional household variables offer information on transportation, the languages spoken in the household, and income for the past year. The head of household data include items such as head's age at interview, birth date, sex, race, state of birth, marital status, ancestry, education status, work status, and military service history. The Sample Weight Section provides appropriate adjustments to be used in making population estimates for the examined sample ages 25-74 as a whole, for the portion of the sample who had the medical history interview only, for those that had specific laboratory tests, for specific age/sex/race strata, and for poverty/nonpoverty status. The final section, variables from the Behavior Questionnaire, includes the 19-item Jenkins Activity Survey (1965 version), which elicits information on the sample respondent's perceptions of his or her own tendencies to be hard-driving, impatient, pressured by time, irritated, and competitive. Ten other questions were asked on amount and frequency of physical activity."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cardiovascular disease"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"emotional states"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"households"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"housing conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"medical history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mental health"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personality assessment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social indicators"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"AHRQMCC I.
