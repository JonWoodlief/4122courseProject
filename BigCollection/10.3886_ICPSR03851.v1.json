Respondents were queried on   whether they approved of his performance as president, whether they   felt that his administration had begun to alter the political   atmosphere that hindered progress, whether they trusted Democrats or   Republicans to better handle the problems the nation was facing,   whether President Clinton's proposed changes were right for the   country, whether they were satisfied with President Clinton's honesty   and integrity, how much they felt President Clinton had accomplished   during his presidency, and whether, based on his performance so far,   he deserved a second term as president. Opinions were solicited on   Bill Clinton's strength as a leader, his vision for the country, his   effectiveness, and trustworthiness. Additional opinions were gathered   on whether President Clinton or congressional Republicans were more   responsible for the successes during his presidency, whether   President Clinton made more or fewer mistakes than usual as   president, whether he was able to deal with the nation's problems,   and whether the media treated him fairly.
