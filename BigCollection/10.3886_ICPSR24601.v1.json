This poll focused on Virginia and the state elections. Virginia residents were asked what was the biggest issue facing Virginia at that time, whether they thought the state of Virginia was moving in the right direction, and to rate the condition of Virginia's economy. Several questions asked whether respondents approved of the way the Virginia state legislature was handling its job, and for opinions of Governor Tim Kaine, Senator James Webb, Senator John Warner, the Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature, Junior Senator Mark Warner, Former Governor Jim Gilmore, and Congressman Tom Davis. Respondents were asked how closely they had been following the races for general assembly and state senate in Virginia, how likely they would be to vote in the Virginia state elections and for whom they would vote if the 2008 United States senate race were being held that day, which political party they would like to see in control of the state legislature, and which issues would be most important in their vote for the Virginia state legislature. A series of questions asked respondents about immigration, including how many recent immigrants lived in the respondents' area at the time, how much contact they had with recent immigrants, their opinions of immigrants and how they affect the country, whether illegal immigration was a problem in their area, and how federal, state, and local governments should handle illegal immigration issues. Information was also collected on how closely respondents were following the 2008 presid\nential race, how likely they were to vote in the 2008 presidential primaries in their state, for whom respondents would vote if the Democratic and Republican primaries and presidential election were being held that day, and for their opinions on the 2008 potential presidential candidates. Respondents were asked which political party they trusted more to handle issues such as taxes and the war in Iraq, which political party they preferred the next president to belong to, as well as whether they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the presidency. Additional topics included the Iraq War, traffic congestion in their area of the state, Virginia's transportation funding plan, and Virginia's law on abusive driver fees. Demographic information includes sex, age, race, education level, household income, religious preference, frequency of religious attendance, whether respondents considered themselves to be a born-again Christian, whether anyone in the household was a military veteran, marital status, type of residential area (e.g., urban or rural), whether respondents were born in the United States, how many years they had lived in the state of Virginia, voter registration status and participation history, political party affiliation, political philosophy, and the presence of children under the age of 18 in the household."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Bush

To achieve greater consistency and reduce the chance of large weights, ABC News in 2007 tested and evaluated iterative weighting, commonly known as raking or rim weighting, in which the sample is weighted sequentially to Census targets one variable at a time, continuing until the optimum distribution across variables (again, age, race, sex, and education) is achieved. ABC News adopted rim weighting in January 2008. Weights are capped at lows of 0.2 and highs of 6."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Washington Post Virginia Poll, October 2007","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":33612,"dataFile":{"id":2600123,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Washington Post Virginia Poll, October 2007","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
