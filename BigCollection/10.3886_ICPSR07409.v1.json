All four projects used a common unit of analysis, namely all  200 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs) that, according  to the 1970 Census, had a population of less than 1,500,000 and were  entirely located within a single state. In each project, a limited  amount of information was collected for all 200 SMSAs. More extensive  data were gathered within independently drawn samples of these SMSAs,  for all local geographical units and each administrative jurisdiction  or agency in the service delivery areas. Two standardized systems of  geocoding -- the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) codes  and the Office of Revenue Sharing (ORS) codes -- were used, so that  data from various sources could be combined. The use of these two  coding schemes also allows users to combine data from two or more of  the research projects conducted in conjunction with the present one,  or to add data from a wide variety of public data files. The present  study includes basic measures of personnel, budgets, equipment, and  manning levels, statistics on fires and losses, and the use of  innovations in fire service delivery for all 200 SMSAs. Fire  prevention and fire suppression activities were investigated in  greater detail in a sample of 50 SMSAs. Data were collected from  public records as well as from interviews conducted with 995 city  executives, fire chiefs from 1,186 fire departments, and 958 building  inspectors. In the initial phases of the project, an econometric model  was used to describe patterns of fire service delivery and their  relative efficiency. Chiefs of fire departments from the 50 sampled  SMSAs were asked to provide information on administrative practices,  personnel, mutual aid contracts, emergency medical and rescue  services, communications, inspection, and investigation services, fire  prevention education, fire planning, and training activities. The  questionnaire administered to building inspectors included items on  budgetary and personnel characteristics, various building code  provisions, allocation of responsibilities for inspection, and the  number of buildings inspected each year. Insurance Service Organization  ratings and fire department replacement values were obtained from the  city managers or executives in places with populations of 2,500 or  more within the 50 sampled SMSAs. The study also provides basic  demographic information about the places where the fire departments were located."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community elites"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"decision making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"econometrics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"emergency services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fire departments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fire insurance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"fire protection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"local government"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"municipal services"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"personnel management"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"population planning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk assessment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"training"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR VIII.C.
