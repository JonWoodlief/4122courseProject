It was  designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of  both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the  project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,  adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the  project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these  social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data  about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and  resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which  was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over  6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and  their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing  circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,  that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial  behaviors.

The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into  343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of  racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.  The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were  composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic  boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered  in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately  8,000 people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Longitudinal Cohort Study</strong></p>\n\n<p>For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample  of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21  strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with  the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to  eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic  status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected  at ran\ndom within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing  of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.  Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts  (birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through  in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the  80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within  six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were  selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of  8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the  eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data  collection and 5,338 were interviewed in the Wave 2 data  collection.</p>\n\n<p>Data collection for Wave 2 began in 1997 and ended in 2000. It  included a letter sent to study participants notifying them that they  would be contacted to schedule an interview. This letter explained the  study, reimbursements, and offered a monthly drawing prize of $1,000  for those participants who kept their first scheduled appointment. A  toll free number was also included in the letter, so participants  could call and schedule their own interviews or ask questions.</p>\n\n<p>For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the  child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to  spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research  assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child  interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face  interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the  personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated  telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in  Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 2 who lived  outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants  were able to travel for interviews. A total of 221 telephone  interviews were conducted during Wave 2, representing 3.55 percent of  the sample.</p>\n\n<p>Proxy interviews were conducted with study participants who were  emancipated minors (under 18 but married or living independently). The  study participants answered questions from the primary caregiver's  interview on the primary caregiver's behalf. In Wave 2, four primary  caregivers and two study participants were interviewed in jail. Study  participants in foster care could not be interviewed. The Department  of Children and Family Services did not allow interviews of the foster  parent or the child. Permission was granted for a brief period in  Wave 1, therefore there are some children in the sample who could not  be followed up in Waves 2 and 3. Some children were not in foster care  in Wave 1 but were placed in foster care by Wave 2 or 3. They were  also not followed up. Lastly, some participants were interviewed in  Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as they were in foster care during Wave 2.</p>\n\n<p>Some participants in Wave 1 spoke a language other than English,  Spanish, or Polish. In Wave 2, an abbreviated version of the primary  caregiver's protocol was administered, and the research assistant  arranged for someone in the household to translate on the spot. In  Wave 2, the complete protocol was translated into Spanish, and a subset  of the primary caregiver's interview was translated into Polish.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the age and wave of data collection, participants were  paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other incentives, such as free  passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes, were also  included.</p>\n\n<p>Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For  example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking  traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,  delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and  self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also  interviewed about family structure, parent chara\ncteristics,  parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental  health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prenatal and Early Health</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Prenatal and Early Health interview was adapted from the  National Maternal and Infant Health Survey which was developed by the  National Institutes of Health (NATIONAL MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH  SURVEY, 1988 [ICPSR 9730]).
