Existing empirical\r\nevidence infers free-riding from the larger military expenditures per gross domestic product\r\n(GDP) of countries of larger GDP. Yet, larger countries have broader military and geostrategic\r\ninterests that result in larger defense burdens, thus creating an identification problem for existing\r\ntests of free-riding behavior. We therefore develop alternative predictions that ignore differences\r\nin the level of military spending and instead relate to growth in spending over time. The safety\r\nlevel of smaller members of an alliance is affected, simultaneously, by changes to military spending\r\nof the largest alliance member as well as by spending changes of the main enemy. Using the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as test case, we estimate country-specific response functions\r\nof the smaller alliance members to growth in US military spending on the one hand and to\r\ngrowth of Soviet spending (if in excess of US growth) on the other, covering the period 1956–\r\n1988. Results from our quasi-spatial approach corroborate one part of the theory in that we find\r\nthe vast majority of the smaller NATO allies to be free-riders. However, our empirical evidence\r\nflatly contradicts the other part of the free-riding theory: the extent of free-riding is not a function\r\nof country size. Smaller allies free-ride, but the relatively larger of the smaller allies do not\r\nfree-ride any less than the relatively even smaller alliance partners."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Neumayer, Eric"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-01-10"}]}},"files":[{"label":"Article for CMPS (alliances).do","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":79175,"dataFile":{"id":2772815,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/4RY8O1/FCHLW4","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/4RY8O1/FCHLW4","filename":"Article for CMPS (alliances).do","contentType":"text/x-stata-syntax","filesize":17202,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1522b930df2-b97d9facb928","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"f450935275931bd0050d05d8ac20d889","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"f450935275931bd0050d05d8ac20d889"}}},{"label":"Article for CMPS (alliances).tab","restricted":false,"version":2,"datasetVersionId":79175,"dataFile":{"id":2772816,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/4RY8O1/FKK47N","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/4RY8O1/FKK47N","filename":"Article for CMPS (alliances).tab","contentType":"text/tab-separated-values","filesize":188856,"storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:1522b931055-0f898853271c","originalFileFormat":"application/x-stata","originalFormatLabel":"Stata Binary","UNF":"UNF:6:ddLD0djJDMET3v2JuxDqug==","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"c088ad50c9fdfa9fc1258a95104a37a3","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"c088ad50c9fdfa9fc1258a95104a37a3"}}}]}}}
