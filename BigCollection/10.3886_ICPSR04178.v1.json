For comparison purposes, cases involving a burglary  charge, a felony not covered under NERA, were examined in addition to  cases involving charges covered by NERA. The following questions  guided the research: (1) Did prosecutors charge a greater proportion  of defendants at offense levels not covered by the law's \"violent  offender\" definitions after the act took effect? (2) As part of plea  agreements, did prosecutors reduce charges from those covered by the  act to offenses not covered by the act? (3) Did trial rates change for those offenses covered by the act?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Data were obtained from the New Jersey  Administrative Office of the Courts for 1996 to May 2000.
