The concept of a wage freeze for public sector workers makes for good politics; however, the Economic effects of doing so can be far more damaging.

The Introduction of the wage freeze by the government has been received with fixed feelings by the people of Zambia. While the wage freeze will result in increased funds to the treasury that can be channeled to the basic social services and investment in public infrastructure, the public and the civil service, the business and the economy will be affected negatively in various ways. \r\n"},"dsDescriptionDate":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Business and Management"]},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Alert, Research"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016-11-29"}]},"geospatial":{"displayName":"Geospatial Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"geographicCoverage","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"country":{"typeName":"country","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"Zambia"}}]}]},"journal":{"displayName":"Journal Metadata","fields":[{"typeName":"journalVolumeIssue","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"journalVolume":{"typeName":"journalVolume","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"4"},"journalIssue":{"typeName":"journalIssue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2/2016"},"journalPubDate":{"typeName":"journalPubDate","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2016"}}]},{"typeName":"journalArticleType","multiple":false,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":"dissertation"}]}},"files":[{"description":"ABC Research Alert, Vol 4, No 2 (2016);\r\nISSN 2413-5224\r\n","label":"The Impact of the Wage Freeze on Business_Civil Service in Zambia","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":96512,"dataFile":{"id":2961927,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/OXY6C1/HCXL4Z","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/OXY6C1/HCXL4Z","filename":"The Impact of the Wage Freeze on Business_Civil Service in Zambia","contentType":"application/pdf","filesize":1314633,"description":"ABC Research Alert, Vol 4, No 2 (2016);\r\nISSN 2413-5224\r\n","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:158afe126d6-c67664097dde","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"102ff9aa63d5b8457e6a9c82b0411cad","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"102ff9aa63d5b8457e6a9c82b0411cad"}}}]}}}
