are living in an age of information explosion. Computer and other electronic resources has become an indispensable tool in our society. The main function of a library is to provide information to the users. With the help of electronic resources the staff, students and the researchers can access to the huge volume of information with speed and accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe internet provides a cheap and efficient means of communication. It is a boon to researchers where they can access to information available through out the universe with the help of online search with the advent of digital revolution, communication became easier and faster and decisions are made instantaneously. The present study is to highlight the user attitude   and approaches towards electronic resources and services in the  academic libraries of Puducherry union territory. Analyze the data with that of available materials in electronic form and users attitude  in selected college libraries in Puducherry union   territory.   The   new   information   technology   has   created   a   new infrastructure for libraries and change the way they function and provide services. Most of the academic  libraries in India fully equipped with modern facilities collections and staff members.\r\n\r\nIn an information system, user is an important component. Access to  relevant  information  is  highly  essential,  particularly  in  industrial \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresearch and development sectors. Basically human has been need the important  of  air,  water,  food  and  shelter.  In  the  modern  world, information is a fifth need of human being. Right information to the right user can pare way to new direction to research and development.\r\n\r\nInformation plays a very important role in every aspect of human life. It is especially true in the context of fast pace of today's life. Where information becomes absolute too soon. The value of information is a crucial factor in the social and economic development and progress of a nation is increasing recognized. To a remarkable extent, information is a source of power. It consists of statements made by individuals or groups of individual about ideas, which they assimilated, into their knowledge store. Information is an element of knowledge store Information is an element of knowledge that is publicly available which can be shared and pass through the world.\r\n\r\nIn this cyber age, information plays a pivotal role in different spheres of human endeavors such as education, research and development, decision and policy making. The role of library and information centers in providing information for these endeavors is well documented. The generators and users of information play a key note in information transfer and utilization process. The information required by \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe users is available in a variety of sources, primary, secondary and tertiary sources and in different formats.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation in particular becomes more meaningful when it is transferred and communicated. The information \"explodes\" into power only when it is transferred and communicated. In other words, information is activised by communication. The purpose of transfer and communication of information is \"use\" without the intention on the part the ultimate receiver or beneficiary of information to use it, the whole exercise of transfer and communication become carry and information transferred becomes redundant. On the other hand, seeking and communicating information are two sides of the same coin from the view point of individuals concurred. Both have the same purpose and use. Information,  which  has  no  use,  is  no  information.  Thus  the  central thread of the whole range of activities relating to information transfer and communication is \"use\". Hence the emphasis is on use and user orientation to communication and information whether from a formally designed and operated information systems or from a formally source. A wide range of research works are centered\r\n\r\naround use and use of information called use and user studies have cropped up in the last four decades. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe user community in an academic library system constitutes the faculty, students, from the view of point of the user whether he is the student, he needs variety of information.\r\n\r\n1.1 User Attitude\r\n\r\nAn attitude is a mental state of readiness exerting directive or dynamic  influence  upon   individual‟s  response   to    all  objects  and situations with which it is related. Therefore if we can have some judgement about the attitude of an individual towards a specific thing or activity then we can have a fair idea as to whether the individual can be persuaded to participate in a particular thing or activity and whether he shall adopt it with interest and sincerity or not.\r\n\r\nThe attitude is the degree of positive or negative effect associated with  some  psychological  objects  namely  institution,  ideal,  symbol, phrase, slogan, job or idea towards which people can differ with respect to positive or negative effect (Thurstone, 1946). The attitude is a dispositional readiness to respond to certain situations, persons, objects in a consistent manner which has been learnt and has become one‟s typical mode of response (Free Mann, 1950).  According to Guild (1950) attitude is a tendency of individual to favourd or not to favourd some type of situation. The attitude may be considered as motivational perceptual states, which direct perceptions and predispose a person to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nact in accordance with perceptions (Allport, 1955). The attitudes are learnt pre-dispositions to respond positively to certain objects, situations, institutions, concepts or other persons (Aiken, 1979).\r\n\r\n1.2 Scientific Attitude\r\n\r\nIt is this attitude which enables us to think rationally, helps to weigh  the  pros  and  cons,  brings  a  rational  outlook  on  issue  and problems, highlights that all human beings are basically the same irrespective of caste, religion or colour. Such an attitude leads us normally towards a society, a world of caring and sharing.\r\n\r\n1.3 Scientific Attitude refers to the following Components\r\n\r\ni.     Critical observation in thought.\r\n\r\nii.    Open mindedness and broad mindedness. iii.   Objective in approach to problems.\r\niv.   Does not believe in superstitions and false beliefs. v.    Belief in cause and effect relationship.\r\nvi.\tTruth  in  observations  and  drawing  conclusions  based  on accurate facts.\r\nvii.  Adopting a planned procedure in solving a problem. viii. Curious to know more about things.\r\nix.   Seeking the facts and avoiding exaggerations and x.    Accepting no conclusions as final or ultimate. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific qualities as stated above, if developed in the minds of the youth and instilled in their behaviourd pattern, solve many problems- individual and social. Every citizen should have scientific attitude to take intelligent decisions and for solving personal as well as environmental problems. In order to advance in science and technology as in developed countries, study of science should become part and parcel of curriculum at all levels. Moreover, it must be taught with experimentation. Only such technique would develop scientific attitude among the citizens of tomorrow, and train them up in scientific method.   Further, scientific attitude will be the basement for modernization, putting an end to superstitions  implanted  in  our  countrymen  from  time  immemorial. Hence, scientific attitude-an offshoot of the study of science, is the present need of our society.\r\n\r\nUltimately, success in life means mastery over life. This results when you exercise your personal power to access your future.  First, it is a matter of proper mental preparation; we all have the ability to adopt productive, emotive attitudes of mind that will invoke:\r\n    the power of desire\r\n\r\n    the power of decision    the power of faith\r\nthe power of courage \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    the power of persistance    the power of discipline\r\n    the power of commitment    the power of enthusiasm    the power of initiative\r\n    the power of gratitude    the power of imaging   the power of optimism   the power of empathy   the power of purpose\r\n    the power of perception\r\n\r\n    the power of concentration    the power of suggestion\r\nthe power of choice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond,  it  is  a  matter  of  physical  action  consistently  applied toward  a  specific  goal.

They reflect how one feels about some thing.  When i  say “I  like   my  job,”   I  am   expressing my  attitude towards work.\r\n\r\nAttitudes are not the same as values, but the two are interrelated. You can see this by looking at the three components of an attitude: cognition, affect, and behavior.\r\n\r\nThe  belief  that “discrimination is wrong” is a value statement. Such an opinion is the cognitive component of an attitude. It sets the state for the more critical part of an attitude – its affective component. After is the emotional  or  feeling  segment  of  an  attitude  and  is  reflected  in  the statement “I don‟t  like  Jon because he  discriminates against minorities.‟ Finally and we‟ll discuss  this  issue  at considerable against  minorities.‟ Finally, and we will discuss this issue at considerable length later in this section,   affect   can   lead   to   behavioral   outcomes.   The   behavioral component of an attitude refers to an intention to behave in a certain way toward someone or something. So to continue our example, I might choose to avoid Jon because of my feeling about him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViewing attitudes as made up of three components - cognition, affect, and behaviour – is helpful toward understanding their complexity and the potential relationship between attitudes and behaviour, but for clarity‟s sake, keep in  mind that the term attitude essentially refers to the part of the three components.\r\n\r\n1.5 Sources of Attitudes\r\n\r\nAttitudes, like values, are acquired from parents, faculty, and peer group members. We are born with certain genetic predisposition. Then, in  our  early  years,  we  begin  modeling  our  attitudes  after  those  we admire, respects, or may be even fear. We observe that way family and friends behave, and we shape our attitudes and behaviour to align with theirs. People also imitate the attitudes of popular individuals and those they  admire  and  respect.  If   the  „right   thing‟    is   to   favor eating at McDonald‟s, you‟ re likely  to hold that attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt contrast to values, your attitudes are less stable. Advertising messages, for example, attempt to alter your attitudes toward a certain product or service: If the people at ford can get you to hold a favorable feeling toward their cars, that altitude may lead to a desirable behavior (for them)-your purchase product. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn organizations, attitudes are important because they affect job behavior. If workers believe, for example, that supervisors, auditors, bosses, and time-and –motion engineers are all in conspiracy to make employees work harder for the same or less money, then it makes sense to try to understand how these attitudes were formed, their relationship to actual job behavior, and how they might be changed.\r\n\r\n1.6 E-Resources\r\n\r\nInternet and World Wide Web (WWW) have a biggest source of information with widest coverage and the fastest access. It is the most powerful tool for global communication and exchange of information. The amount of publicly available information on the web is increasing consistently at an unbelievable rate. It has revolutionized the way that people access information, and has opened up new possibilities in areas such as digital libraries, information dissemination and retrieval, education, commerce, entertainment, government and health care. The WWW can be a great place to accomplish research on many topics but finding quality web materials.\r\n\r\nE-resource is an electronic information resource that can access on the web, on or off campus.  Material (data and/or program(s) encoded for manipulation by a computerized device. This material may require the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse of a peripheral directly connected to a computerized device (e.g. CD- ROM drive) or a connection to a computer network (e.g. Internet).\r\n\r\nE-resource is defined   as a resource which requires computer access or any electronic product that delivers a collection of data, be it text referring to full text bases, electronic journals, image collections, other multimedia products and numerical, graphical or time based, as a commercially available title that has been published with an aim to being marketed. These may be delivered on CD-ROM, on tape, via internet and so on. Over the past few years, a numbers of techniques and related standards have been developed which allow documents to be created and distributed in electronic form. Hence to cope with the present situation, libraries are shifting towards new media, namely electronic resources for their collection developments that the demands of users are better fulfilled. E-resources on magnetic and optical media have a vast impact on the collections of university libraries. These are more useful due to inherent capabilities for manipulation and searching, providing information  access  is  cheaper  to  acquiring  information  resources, savings in storage and maintenance etc. and sometimes the electronic form is the only alternative. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsers  are  increasingly  expected  to  use  electronic  resources. Studies were undertaken to determine the level of use of this type of resource, how users feel about various issues surrounding electronic resources and whether attitudes change dependent upon subject studied to determine level of use of various electronic information resources, ways in which they felt electronic resources had hindered or improved their academic career, if they perceived themselves capable of using the resources, would the standard of their work suffer without the use of these resources  and the various methods employed to acquire the skills necessary to use the sources.\r\n\r\nIn  conjunction  with  these  technological  advances,  many  stand alone CD-ROMs, which have been in operation for the last decade, are being increasingly networked, providing access from any networked computer terminal in the institution not solely within the library itself, hence improving user accessibility.\r\n\r\nElectronic information sources offer today's users different opportunities from their predecessors. The advantages of e-resources for the user, the information needed can be delivered from the most appropriate source to the user; the user can re-specify his or her needs dynamically; the information is obtained when it is wanted, so becomes \"just  in  time\"  rather  than  \"just  in  case\";  the  user  selects  only  the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation needed to answer the specific question and, finally, the information is only stored should the user wish. Electronic information can  therefore  provide  a  number  of  advantages  over  traditional  print based sources.\r\n\r\nThese advantages include the fact that electronic information sources are often faster than consulting print indexes, especially when searching retrospectively, and they are more straight forward when wishing to use combinations of keywords. They open up the possibility of searching multiple files at one time, a feat accomplished more easily than when using printed equivalents. Electronic resources can be printed and searches saved to be repeated at a later date; they are updated more often than printed tools. One main advantage, especially to distance learners or those with limited time to access the library, is their availability from outside the library by dial-up access.\r\n\r\nInternet and electronic information with no print equivalents present new challenges to scholars. Increasingly information is being published only in electronic formats, and questions about how to cite these sources in academic papers have become frequent at library service desks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6.1 Types of E-Resources\r\n\r\nThe e-resources are basically divided in two major types:\r\n\r\n1. Online e-resources, which may include\r\n\r\n- e-journal (Full Text & Bibliographic Databases)\r\n\r\n- e-books\r\n\r\n- on-line Databases\r\n\r\n- web sites\r\n\r\n2. Other Electronic resource may include\r\n\r\n- CD ROM\r\n\r\n- Diskettes\r\n\r\n- Other portable computer databases\r\n\r\nThese components are explained in the following sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne-journals\r\n\r\nElectronic issues of journals and articles to periodicals the library subscribes  in.  It  consists  of  Full-text  and  Bibliographic  Databases. Full-text  databases  contain  the  whole  content  of  an  article  such  as citation    information,    text,    illustrations,    diagrams    and    tables. Bibliographic databases only contain citation information of an article, such as author name, journal title, publication date and page numbers. An e-database is an organized collection of information. It supports flexible and in-depth searching of different fields, e.g. journal title, article \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntitle, author, abstract, year, etc. We can only search for journal title in the Library Catalogue, but not the title or author of individual articles. Therefore, e-database is extremely useful to find articles on particular topics, e.g. peer assessment in classroom. A particular journal articles can retrieve from e-databases, which could not find the same information via the Library Catalogue.\r\n\r\nLibraries have been exploring easy to cope with the problems of ever increasing prices of the journals, space requirements and decreasing level  of  usage  as  the  journals  get  older.  Nevertheless,  libraries  are required to maintain back issues of the journals, usually in bound form. Electronic Journal helps the librarians in addressing these problems to a great extent without significantly affecting the service levels. Electronic Journals can be accessed via internet from any web enabled PC. Depending on the type of subscription, one or more users can access the service simultaneously, either directly from an independent web enabled PC or in a local area network through a proxy server (IP addresses based access). Electronic journals also offer benefit of full text searching and downloading of articles. Many publishers of electronic journals offer their journals through consortia of libraries at much lower rates. INDEST and INFLIBNET are two such consortia operating in India. Access to articles in  electronic  journals  can  also  be  made  through  aggregator  services \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich offer searchable databases of contents of e-journals from several publishers, and links to journal site for full text.  Emerald, OCLC and J-Gate are some of the example of e-journal aggregator services. The main  disadvantage  of  electronic  journal  is  that  libraries  can  not physically possess the journals.\r\n\r\ne-book\r\n\r\ne-book is an electronic version of a printed book covering its full contents (text, tables, diagrams, illustrations, etc.). An e-book collection is usually set up in an e-database, which supports full-text searching within  and  across  titles,  advanced  search  and  bookmark  functions. Users can view full text of e-books in HTML or PDF format online. e-book has been described as a text analogous to a book that is in digital form to be displayed on a computer screen. E-books can be read just like a printed book, using dedicated e-Book reader such as GemStar eBook or on a computer screen after downloading it. There are also some newer technologies developing such as electronic paper, which is much like paper, except that the text can be changed, and talking books in MP3 format. e-book offer advantages like portability, 24 hours access, text search, annotation, linking, and multimedia and self-publishing possibilities. Development of e-book is still in the infancy stage and issues like   compatibility, e-book readers, availability and intellectual \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty rights are to be addressed before it can be implemented on large scale.\r\n\r\nOn-line Databases\r\n\r\nOn-line Databases is a collection of information categorized by specific fields. Databases are usually searchable by keywords topics. An e-database is an organized collection of information, of a particular subject  or  multi-disciplinary  subject  areas. The information of an e- database can be searched and retrieved electronically.   Contents include journal articles, newspaper articles, book reviews and conference proceedings, etc. Information organized and stored in a database, with structured cross-document search and retrieval, relational data structures, efficient query mechanisms.\r\n\r\nWebsites\r\n\r\nA library web page or Universal Resource Locator (URL) facilitates single window access to various web enabled library services.   A URL could be as simple as a library web page listing the services with some links to catalogue and external free and subscribed resources or may include advance features like interactive helps and value added services such as subject gateways, self-help tools and frequently asked questions, and information about the library such as timings, calendar, rules etc can  be  hosted  on  the  library  web  site.  Apart  from  the  ICT enabled \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconventional services, Libraries are making use of potential of internet and computing power to provide new and innovative services. It is intended to help guide its users towards understanding consciousness. The ability to view the most recent content from hundreds of websites from a single program not only keeps up-to-date on the news and information, it is fast and easy to use.\r\n\r\nWeb pages are a presentation of information which can be presented in carefully chosen media most appropriate for content. Web pages can be static or dynamic, meaning that the content is the same each time someone visits the webpage or is taken from a database which is updated with new content. For example if a webpage, say the homepage, had a \"news\" area describing current news in relation to a company or event, then when a new news item came up or expired, new news item would appear and old news item disappear from the news section on the homepage.\r\n\r\nContent and its presentation is the most important part of website. It is what people visit and hopefully recommend the website for. Websites content can be presented in many forms, the most common and accessible being text and graphics. For example, a website aimed at blind or partially sighted people is going to be a non-visual website making \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest use of text (which can be heard using a text to audio web browser)\r\n\r\nspoken word and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe merits of website are\r\n\r\n  Fast and easy access to website content.\r\n\r\n No spam, few ads (about to change), and only content and photographs.\r\n  User chooses the sites and content they want.\r\n\r\n  User controls what they see and don‟t  see.\r\n\r\n  User sees the most recently updated content without having to prowl around the site.\r\n  Less time searching and hunting for commonly needed information and resources.\r\n  Information is presented in excerpts or full articles, free of\r\n\r\n  styling and heavy-handed site designs and layouts - content and information is the priority.\r\n  Replaces  email  and  newsletters  to  alert  users of updates, new content, and other topical information like press releases and events.\r\n  Provides another form of content delivery in addition to the website itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of Library Websites\r\n\r\n•    Promote library use\r\n\r\n•    Provide information about the library and its activities\r\n\r\n•    Provide online access to local information sources\r\n\r\n•\tAct as a gateway to networked information resources (CD-ROM, intranet/Internet)\r\n•    Integrate Push-based services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6.2 Advantages of E-Resources\r\n\r\nThe reasons for actually embarking on the purchasing of electronic resources are generally accepted because of the ease of usability, readability, affordability and accessibility. The following are the advantages of e-resources over the print media\r\ni.\tMulti-access: A networked product can provide multiple points of access\tat  multiple  points  round  the  clock  and  to  multiple simultaneous users.\r\nii.\tSpeed: An electronic resource is lot quicker to browse or search, to extract information from, and to integrate that information into other material and to cross-search or reference between different publications. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niii.\tFunctionality: E-resource  will  allow  the  user  to  approach  the publications to analyze its content in new ways by click of the mouse on search mode.\r\niv.\tContent:   The   e-resources   can   contain   a   vase   amount   of information,  but  more  importantly  the  material  can  consist  of mixed media i.e. images, video, audio animation which could not be replaced in print.\r\n\r\nMobility,  Saving  Physical  Space,  Convenience,  Saving  time  &\r\n\r\nmoney are some other advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.6.3  Disadvantages of E-Resources\r\n\r\nNow, more and more people prefer e-resources to traditional ones, because it can save their time and money. However, with various e- resources flooded in, more and more people are aware of the disadvantages of e-resources.\r\ni.\tThe  fact  that,  e-resources  require  special  devices  or  personal computers can be looked as a disadvantage. Many e-resources are typically produces to be compatible for certain software which in turn may be not easily available. Since e-resources are dependent on other equipments, certain hardware or software failure may affect it. Unless the hardware, Internet connection or battery power that is required by an e-resource reader is readily available, then \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits electronic documents are useless. In addition, e-resources depending on hardware and software and are more easily damaged than a printed book\r\nii.\te-resource reading devices are surely more expensive than printed books. All devices of e-resources require power. There is a growing concern that the e-resources at present may not be accessible or compatible to the future e-resources software or devices.\r\niii.\tScreen  glare  and  eyestrain  are  a  serious  concern  for  many potential users of e-resource technology. A major worry of reading from an e-resource reader could hurt the eyes. The display resolution\tof   computer   screens   and   electronic   devices   is considerably less than the print quality produced by a printing press.\r\niv.\tReading  from  a  computer  lacks  the  familiarity  and  comfort  of reading from a book. A paper book can be opened and flipped through, while an electronic text is more difficult to navigate.\r\nv.\tE-resources have unreliable life span. Paper has a much longer life span than most digital forms of storage. Because of the rapid development of new computer systems it is difficult to judge whether the software or hardware will become outdated. As new hardware is developed structures must be put into place to allow for the migration of existing materials to the new platforms so that \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey can still be accessed. Methods of preserving the electronic documents must also be developed. A high degree of reliability of the equipment must be part of the electronic devices that handle the replacements for printed books.\r\nvi.\tMany titles that are available in traditional print books are not yet available in an electronic book format.\r\nvii.\tNew technologies always require time, experience, and money in order to take full advantage of its capabilities\r\n\r\n1.7 Indian Scenario for E-Resources\r\n\r\nLibraries function as an essential integral component in higher education system. Academic libraries in India are facing a lot of problems due to static budget and exponential price hike of library collections. The library environment is currently undergoing a rapid and dynamic revolution leading to new generation of libraries with the emphasis on e- resources. A lot of efforts have been taken in past few years to overcome this problem of financial crunch by resource sharing through consortia for university libraries. UGC-INFONET and INDEST-AICTE consortium are two major initiatives for university library users. These revolutionary steps are providing scholarly resources including peer reviewed journals, databases,  abstracts  proceeding  etc.  These  efforts  must  be  boon  to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuniversity library users which will definitely boost the level of higher education system in our country.\r\n\r\nLibrary Consortium is a group of two or more libraries which have agreed to co-operate with one another in order to fulfill certain similar needs, usually resource sharing. It usually, refers to co-operation, co- ordination and collaboration between, and amongst libraries for the purpose of sharing information. Consortia are basically, evolving a form of  cooperation  among  the  libraries  which  come  together  to  share resources electronically. It has gained momentum even in developing countries like India.\r\n\r\nSome of the successful library consortia setup so far in India are\r\n\r\n1)  UGC-INFONET E-journal consortium.\r\n\r\n2)  Indian National Digital library in Engineering, Sciences and\r\n\r\nTechnology (INDEST) Consortium.\r\n\r\n3)  Inter University Centres (IUC-DAEF Consortia)\r\n\r\n4)  Health Sciences Library and Information Network (HELINET)\r\n\r\n5)  Forum for Resource Sharing in Astronomy and Astrophysics\r\n\r\n(FORSA)\r\n\r\n6)\tCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR e-journals consortium) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the mentioned consortia, there have been efforts to setup similar kind of consortia by ICAR, ICMR, ICSSR and other government agencies to provide and access to e-resources. Among the above all consortia, UGC-INFONET and INDEST-AICTE consortium are proving to be a boon for the academic users. These two major initiatives have come to the rescue of academic libraries so that they can cater to the needs of academic depending upon them. These revolutionary steps are providing scholarly resources including peer reviewed journals, databases, abstracts, proceedings etc. these efforts will boost the higher education system in India.\r\n\r\n1.8 Motivation for the Effective Utility of E-Resources\r\n\r\nToday availability of e-resources in a academic library is very common. But their proper and maximum use is a matter for discussion. Advances in computer applications during the past few decades have brought radical changes in the way information is gathered, store, organized, accessed, retrieved and consumed. The application of computers in information processing has brought several products and services  to  the  scene.  The  Internet  and  the  Web  are  constantly influencing the development of new modes of scholarly communication; their potential for delivering goods is quite vast, as they overcome successfully the geographical limitations associated with the print media. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, the distribution time between product publication and its delivery has been drastically reduced. The Internet can be used for efficient retrieval and meeting information needs. This is very important for  university  libraries  since  most  of  them  call  for  more  and  more research work. This important fact is convincing many libraries to move towards digital e-resources, which are found to be less expensive and more useful for easy access. This is especially helpful to distant learners who have limited time to access the libraries from outside by dial-up access to commonly available electronic resources, mainly CD-ROM, OPACs and Internet, which are replacing the print media.\r\n\r\n1.9 Need and Significance of the Study\r\n\r\nFung and  Wagnell dictionary defines information as  “  Timely or specific knowledge concerning some matter of interest or inquiring” Similarly   Webster‟s  dictionary   defines   it    as   \"communication and reception of knowledge”.\r\n\r\nInformation is the content message of communication Information and communication are inseparable like two sides of coin. Importance of communication in organizations cannot be gained. S.R. Renganathan aptly said that communication is essential for living in biological, social and spiritual planes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.A.Scarrott writes “Human society can be  recognized to be  a living organized system banded and operated by information in the form of communication interchanged and usually honoured by its members such communication  constitute  the  elementary  Social  bonds  in  human society”\r\n\r\nWe seek information to make sense of the world, getting across a barrier solve a problem, and to fill a gaping our knowledge.\r\n\r\nChapterization Schemes\r\n\r\nThe first chapter includes introduction of information, Theories of information seeking Behaviour, Information and its uses, Information, Information seeking behaviour, Information Access Pattern, users, user study, and classification of user study.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter presents a various detail of the earlier studies in the area of profile of the puducherry union territory of study.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third chapter presents a review of related literature of works published on the concepts involved in Information, resources, Facilities and services provided by academic library. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapter Presents the research design that includes the topic of investigation, objective, hypotheses, methodology, sampling data collection, data analysis, and limitations of the study.\r\n\r\nThe fifth chapter presents the data analysis and Interpretation in the form of tables, graphs and charts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth chapter presents the summary of findings, suggestions, recommendations and conclusion of the study. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1.

Conditioned by its geography, history and culture, Pondicherry reflects the South Indian world view in which the concept of femininity- motherhood is central to the way of life and education is perceived as the gateway for better livelihood. In the 20th century, especially, much attention was given to the social development of women especially under the influence of the Mother (Mirra Alfaasa) of Aurobindo Ashram- Auroville.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nLegends associate old Pondicherry with the great Hindu sage Agastya. It is believed that Agastya established an Ashram there and the place was known as Agastiswaram. An inscription found near Vedapuriswara temple built and rebuilt many times lends credibility to this legend. There is also mention in the Bahur Plates of the existence of a Sanskrit University in the place during early times. Indeed, the place \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas considered to be a seat of traditional learning and Vedic culture. Excavations  in  the region  of  Arikamedu, south of Pondicherry town, indicate that there was a Roman settlement there between 2nd Century of the Pallava Kingdom of Kanchipuram from about the 4th Century A.D. It came under the Chola dynasty of Thanjavur in the 10th Century A.D. and later under the Pandya kingdom in the 13th Century. Still later it came under the Vijayanagar Empire which controlled the whole of South India until early 17th Century. In the meantime, at the beginning of the\r\n16th Century the Portuguese had established a factory in Pondicherry. The Portuguese had to leave when the Sultan of Bijapur came to have sway over Gingee in the 17th Century. Thereafter, the Danes, the Dutch and the French followed and set up their establishments/trading posts. It was in 1673 that the French Period of Pondicherry began. Franois Martin,   the   first   French   Governor   developed   Pondicherry   into   a flourishing port town from a small fishing village that it was. In 1693, the town transferred hands to the Dutch who fortified it. It was transferred back to the French in 1699 by the. traite de Ryswick.. Frangois Martin who was appointed Administrator following the .traite of Ryswick., brought stability to Pondicherry and developed the town further. Dumas, who succeeded him, followed in the footsteps of Francois Martin. In the Eighteenth Century Pondicherry was laid out on a grid pattern and it grew  considerably.  The  French  obtained  Karaikal  from  the  King  of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanjavur in 1738 and Mahe from the ruler of Badagara in 1721. Yanam came into their possession in 1731. Under Governor Dupleix (1742-54), Pondicherry expanded further in size and became very prosperous. But, Dupleix was recalled to France when his hopes of creating a French colonial India were thwarted by Robert Clive of England.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Anglo-French wars (Carnatic wars) Pondicherry was royed in 1761. Thereafter, over the next fifty years Pondicherry changed lands between the British and the French frequently in the course of wars and reaties. After 1816, the French obtained permanent control over Pondicherry. The next   138 years witnessed rebuilding of Pondicherry with significant developments in the areas of infrastructure, education  and  law.  The  French  -etained  Pondicherry  even  after  the British left India in  1947. In  1954, Pondicherry passed hands from the French to independent India and became a Union Territory with headquarters at Pondicherry. In May 1956, the .treaty of transfer, was signed in Delhi. Several thousands in Pondicherry opted for French nationality  at  the  time  of  independence.  A  large  number  of  Tamil residents in Pondicherry still have French Passports, having chosen to remain French nationals. Today, nearly 20,000 Pondicherry people live in France and nearly 14,000 French nationals live in the Territory of Pondicherry. Many Pondicherrian French still look to France for their \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture and direction. There are also some who feel that the French of Pondicherry .are a kind of nowhere people,  neither  French  nor Indian. Continued  bonds  with  France  and Pondicherry have made the Union Territory rather unique.\r\n\r\nEconomy\r\n\r\nThe Net State Domestic Product of the UT is Rs.3828 crore (2002-03). source of occupation in the UT. It forms around 25% of employment. The remaining 75% of the employment are predominantly from services and marginally from industries. In the rural areas more than a third of the population depends on agriculture. Rice, sugar cane, coconut, ground nut, pulses and cotton are the major crops. The total production of food crops is 3.27 lakh tonnes of which sugar cane accounts for 2.38 lakh tonnes, paddy about 60,000 tonnes and pulses about 4,000 tonnes. The status of employment of women in the UT is conditioned by these aspects of the economy. Over 80% of the net area sown in the UT is irrigated by canals and tube wells. In Pondicherry region, there are several artesian and semi artesian aquifers. The ground water is fairly intensively exploited. Ground water exploitation is Karaikal region is mainly done by deep tube wells and filter points, as water quality is not good at shallow depths. In the Mahe region, while ground water is accessible at fairly low depths, the problem of salt-water intrusion is encountered, especially \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduring summer months. In Yanam region, groundwater is accessed through filter points within a depth of ten meters. Agriculture in the UT is predominantly small holding based. The proportion of the holdings which are less than one hectare is 78%. The UT also lends itself for meaningful  marine  and  inland  fishery  activities  with  45  kms.  of coastline, about 700 sq.kms. of inshore waters and some brackish water areas. While poultry development has not been significant, animal husbandry development tonnes. Majority of the industrial units are small scale enterprises. There are a few textile mills and sugar factories. Road connectivity  which  is  very  crucial  for  socio-economic  development  is\r\n100% in the UT, compared to 78% in the country as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages, Religion and Culture\r\n\r\nThe main languages spoken in the Union Territory of Pondicherry are Tamil (in Pondicherry and Karaikal), Telugu (in Yanam) and Malayalam (in Mahe), apart from French which continues to be spoken by many. Hinduism, Christianity and Islam co-exist in Pondicherry. The Hindus have scores of ancient temples in Pondicherry. Famous among them being Varadaraja temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Villianur temple dedicated to Thirukameshwara and Thirunallar temple dictated to Planet Saturn, Sani. Karaikal is the Gateway to various places of worship in the eastern coast of Tamil Nadu. Velankanni and Nagore the two famous \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaces of pilgrimage for Christians and Muslims respectively are near Karaikal. For the Muslims, Masthan Saheb Darga (dedicated to Masthan Syed Buhari, a Sufi aint) is very sacred. The Christians have half a dozen famous churches . Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, Church of the Immaculate Conception, the Notre Dame des Anges and the Villianur and Ariankuppam Churches. The typical Hindu way of deifying the woman power (Sakthi)   is   reflected   in   the   worship   of various   forms   of ammans. Muthumariamman, Angalamman, Draupadhi Amman etc. The Hindu festivals also are reflective of the deification of the woman. Thiraiyattam,  dedicated  to  Goddess  Bhagavathi, the Mangani festival dedicated to Karaikal Ammaiyar (believed to have been a Shaivite Saint elevated to the status of Goddess), the Kandoori festival dedicated to Karaikal  Durga  etc. are  examples.  During festivals, fire walking and Sedal (devotees piercing their body and tongue with silver hooks and Vels) are practised by some in the belief that these practices lead to self purification. There are hosts of Saneeswara (Lord Saturn), Women and Matrimony The Saneeswara (Lord Saturn) temple at Thirunallar is believed to be the only one in the country dedicated to this God. Those who are troubled by vicissitudes in life and wish bright future go on a pilgrimage to pay obeisance to Lord Saturn. Often, those afflicted by Sade Sathi (seven-and-a-half-year affliction), especially girls, around the time desired for the conduct of their marriage are taken to this temple. More \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan two thousand pilgrims visit this temple everyday. The Sani Peyarchi festival is the .Kumbh Mela of Pondicherry. attracting lakhs of devotees, other festivals, famous among which are Masquerade (Mask) festival (of French tradition) and the International Yoga festival. Shri Aurobindo Ashram was founded by Shri. Aurobindo in 1926. The spiritual tenets of the Ashram combine Yoga and modern science. The offshoot of the Ashram, the Aurovillel was inspired by the evolutionary vision of Shri. Aurobindo and founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfaasa, known as the Mother. It was meant to be an experiment in international living where men and women could live in peace, progress and harmony with each other, remaining above all creeds. Pondicherry is also reputed for its Shaiva Sidhanta (Shaivite philosophy) tradition. The French institutions of research in Pondicherry are home to a collection of 11,000 manuscripts concerning this philosophy. An Indo-French Project in collaboration with the government, s National Mission for Manuscripts is now under formulation. Aayi is believed to have been an exemplary woman of Pondicherry in the 16th century. The story about her is that she razed her house to the ground to construct a reservoir for soldiers to quenchtheir thirst. It was also from this reservoir that Napolean.s men quenched their thirst 300 years later. It is said that Napolean, charmed by this story, ordered construction of a monument for her. The Aayi Mandapam at the centre of the Government Park in Pondicherry is said \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto be  this monument.The  old  French  colony has retained its Indian character, but the French influence in .Puducheri. as it is called now, can be found in the red kepis (military caps) of the police officials, French spelling on signboards and traffic signs and some buildings and old stones. Streets are referred to as .rue..Married women are addressed as Madame and men as Missieur. Creole food, basically rice and non- vegetarian preparations, is characterized by French restraint. The status of women in Pondicherry has been considerably influenced by the teachings of the Mother. She believed in the equality of sexes and wanted same education and training to be given to boys and girls. Subramanya Bharathy (1882-1921) known as Mahakavi (Great Poet) Bharathiar who lived in Pondicherry since 1908 worked tirelessly for the freedom movement and emancipation. He also espoused the cause of women.s freedom. Panchali Sapatham (Draupadi.s vow), one of the Mahakavi.s work was a poetic semi-political reflection on greed, pride and righteousness inspired by the Mahabharata. His eventful life, though short, hugely impacted on the people of Pondicherry.\r\n\r\nHuman development\r\n\r\nIn terms of the Human Development Index and Gender Disparity Index2 , the UT holds the 6th  and 5th ranks respectively (Appendix 1). Social  sector  expenditure  in  the  UT  is  37%  as  against  the  Central \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  figure  of  15%  (1997-98).  Nonetheless,  expenditure  on women as a proportion of Net State Domestic Product is only 0.049% (2001-02). This proportion in the case of children is 3.5%. Per capita expenditure on women, s development is Rs. 18.94 and in the case of children  it  is  Rs.l,  176.18  (2001-02).  The  per capita  expenditure on women.s development has trebled between 1993-94 and 2000-01. It has also exceeded the Central expenditure in this regard marginally in 2000-\r\n01. The per capita expenditure on child development in Pondicherry has doubled since 1993-94. Since this year, it has all along been twice as much as the per capita expenditure at the Centre.\r\n\r\nDEMOGRAPHY Population\r\nThe population of Pondicherry (Census, 2001) is 9.74 lakhs. As the country total population, it is 0.09%. Women and men.\r\nConstitute exactly 50% of the population (4.87 lakh). The average annual exponential growth rate (1991-2001) of population is 1.87% as against 1.93% for the whole of India. The UT has registered significant reduction in population growth rate compared to the previous decade (1981-1991) which was 2.90%. Population growth rate in Pondicherry is also  impacted  by  migration  from  Tamil  Nadu,  Kerala  and  Andhra Pradesh. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUrbanization\r\n\r\nPondicherry is highly urbanized. Urban population accounts for\r\n\r\n67% as against the All India proportion of 28% (2001). The average annual rate of growth of urbanization of the UT is 1.95% (1991-2001). Majority  of  the  population  of  the  UT  resides  in  the  districts  of Pondicherry and Karaikal. In terms of the size of the population, ranking in the descending  order is Pondicherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam. There is no rural population as such in Yanam and Mahe. In Pondicherry district, the proportion of rural population is 31%. In Karaikal, it is 56%.\r\n\r\nDensity\r\n\r\nThe UT occupies the third rank in the country amongst States and Union Territories with a population density of 2,029 per sq.km. This reflects an addition of 346 per sq.km. compared 1991 when it was 1,683 per sq.km. Density in the UT is seven times that of India as a whole.\r\n\r\nScheduled Castes\r\n\r\nScheduled Caste population of the UT is 1.58 lakh, constituting\r\n\r\n16.2% as against 16.5% in the population of the country as whole [Annexure Table 2(iii)]. Majority of the scheduled Caste population (77%) lives in Pondicherry district followed by Karaikal (20%). There are no Scheduled Tribes in the UT. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Infrastructure\r\n\r\nPondicherry has a health care infrastructure superior to that in existence in the rest of India . despite the logistical problems that the UT has in facilitating access to medical services. The people live in habitations spread over 261 villages, many of them falling in the distant enclaves of Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam, located 130 kms., 650 kms. and\r\n950 kms. respectively from Pondicherry. It has alsobeen estimated that more than 40% of the patients accessing medical care in Pondicherry are from the adjoining States of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nAccess to education in the UT is of a high order, conforming to All India norms. As of year 2002, the UT had 187 habitations. Of this, 172 had primary schools within one kilometer of walking distance, 162 out of them being located within the habitations themselves. A large majority of the  habitations  (164)  also  have  upper  primary  schools  within  3 kilometers of walking distance Average distance from habitations within which schools can be accessed.Source: National Commission for Women: Data obtained from Government of Pondicherry.\r\n\r\nHigher Education \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPondicherry has, apart from a University, 33 higher educational institutions. 11 Arts, Science and Commerce Colleges, 5 Engineering, Technical and Architecture Colleges, 6 Medical Colleges, 5 Teacher Training Colleges and 6 other Institutions imparting education in Law, Management, Information Technology and Agriculture. Further, there are\r\n10  Teacher  Training  Schools,  5  Polytechnics  and  Technical  Schools. While the enrolment of the girls for higher education is more or less equivalent to  that  of  boys  (9,233  girls  as against 9,691  boys),  their enrolment in Polytechnics is much lesser . 674 against 1,118. Their enrolment  in  Teacher  Training  Schools  is  higher  than  of  boys.  287 against 160.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpenditure on Education\r\n\r\nThe per capita expenditure on education in Pondicherry is more than iouble that of the whole of India. Among the South Indian States, this expenditure is the highest in Pondicherry, though the proportion of educational expenditure to total budget is the lowest Covers expenditure on education by Education as well as other Departments. Source: Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of Secondary and higher Education; Selected Educational Statistics ( 2002-03).\r\nLiteracy \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Literacy rate that obtains in the UT of Pondicherry is 81.2% (88.6% for males and 73.9% for females). Literacy rates in Pondicherry are significantly higher than for All India, for both females and males. Pondicherry holds the seventh rank in India for literacy (2001) which it had in 1991 also. Between 1991 and 2001 the UT gained in literacy by\r\n6.75 percentage points against the All India figure of 13.29 (Table 4.8 85\r\n\r\nAnnexure Table 4 (I)). There are still 1.59 lakh illiterates in the UT (0.47 lakh males and 1.12 lakh females).  Majority of the illiterates are in Pondicherry and Karaikal districts.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT Work Participation\r\nWork Participation Rate (WPR) in Pondicherry is 35.2%. This is lesser than the figure for Tamil Nadu but close to the All India and Kerala figures. Female WPR in the UT (17.2%) is lesser than a third of the male WPR (53.1%). Among the districts. Pondicherry, Karaikal and Yanam have male WPRs which are close - 53.6%, 52.6% and 52.3% respectively. Male WPR in Mahe is 44.7%. Female WPRs in the districts are at significant  variance.  The  lowest  female  WPR  obtains  in Mahe  (8.2%) following Yanam (10.3%). The lower female WPRs in the latter districts are accounted for by the fact that they are urban areas where reliance on agriculture  for  livelihood  is  almost  non-existent,  while  presence  of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagriculture affords relatively greater employment. The high level of urbanization of the UT, low level of engagement in agriculture and the low WPR for females compared to India and in all the\r\n\r\nNeighbouring States depress the work participation rates in the UT. Generally, the patterns of work participation in the different districts of the UT closely follow the patterns in the adjacent States Mahe District with its lowest WPR of 25% follows its neighbours in Kerala, and Karaikal with its highest WPR of 33.5% is in the direction of higher WPR of Tamil Nadu. Yanam, with 31.5%, is a reflection of its urban characteristic, and so is Pondicherry with 31.5%. The male WPRs range between 52 and\r\n53% for three districts while it touches a low of 44.7% for Mahe. Lower work participation rates for females bring down the total work participation rates in all the districts and for the UT. [Annexure Table\r\n5(i)]. The distribution of workers in the main and marginal category in the different districts of the UT is presented in Annexure Table 5 (ii). The total work participation rates have been gently rising for Pondicherry over the three Censusesperiods from 1981. The male work participation rate increased between 1981 and 1991 even when there was a drop at the All India level, and the increase has continued between 1991 and\r\n2001. The increase is lower for females compared to males. This is in contrast with the trend for All India, where the female WPR has increased \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween 1981 and 1991 against the decline for males and more significantly than for males between 1991 and 2001. Total Work Participation is lowest in Mahe District (25%) and highest in Pondicherry District (36.1%) and the other two Districts of Yanam and Karaikal come between these two with the values of 31.5% and 33.7%; (26) 1 In the case of females also, the pattern of total WPR repeats . with 8.2% and 18.5% respectively for Mahe and Pondicherry Districts; 1 In the case of males also, WPR is very low at 34.7% in Mahe District and highest at 53.6% in Pondicherry District; and 1 In all Districts, female work participation is low and significantly brings down the total work participation rates. 1\r\nAnother reason for low female WPR is the factor of higher level of urbanization of the UT and total urbanization of two districts namely, Mahe and Yanam. The proportion of marginal workers in the UT, both males and females has increased significantly between 1991 and 2001, reflecting the All India trend. The increase is very drastic in the case of males. It is a matter of great concern that marginal workers amongst women have increased very significantly in all the Southern States and at the All India level. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Labour\r\n\r\nDespite high human development in Pondicherry, the practice of child labour does exist in the Union Territory. There are about 3, 000 child labourers many of whom are girls. In the age group of 5 to 14, child labour population is 1.1% among girls and 2% among boys (1991). They are engaged in unorganized industries like building construction. They also work as contract workers in organized industries like glass manufacture. Incidence among them of occupational diseases like silicosis, respiratory diseases etc., has been reported. The Labour Department of the Government of Pondicherry runs 11 Child Welfare Centres . 7 in Pondicherry, 2 in Karaikal and 1 each in Mahe and Yanam. The objective of running these Centres is to give pre-school education to children below 5 years of age hailing from labour families in areas of work concentration. The children are also provided  nutritious meals. This activity also helps working to go to their work places, leaving their children safely behind in the pre-school education institutions. The Department of Women and Child Development, inter alia, implements programmes for training of women for employment and for their income generation through the Corporation of Pondicherry. Training activities are undertaken by the District Industries Centres as well. It is reported that 2500 women have been benefited in terms of self-employment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER - III\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of review literature is an important aspect in any research through which one understand the past trends in research output in any particular discipline.  A review is   a significant step to get clear pictures of what has been done and suggested already with regard to problem understanding.  The study of the previous research findings gives a hint to the budding area of fresh research.\r\n\r\nAn  attempt  has  been  made  by  the  researcher  to  collect  the literature and studies which are related to the problem taken up for this study. The attempt is to highlight the finding of some of the studies related to this topic conducted which helps to undertake the present study in a systematic manner. A number of studies have been carried out on the awareness, usage etc., regarding electronic resources in the library and the studies are briefly listed below.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nIn a study Kanakachary (1989)1  “User’s Survey of Engineering CollegeLibrary, Osmania University, Hyderabad: A Case Study”revealed that 66.7% users were satisfied, while 33.3% were dissatisfied with the quality and standard of periodicals on subscription in college library. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly 85% users were unaware of catalogue and more than 90% users were not satisfied with physical facilities. Clee and Maguire (1993) “Library Environment and Library Usage”concluded that although individual factors in library environment do effect users’ perceptions, it is the total library environment that makes greatest effect. Marshall et al (1993) brought forward that more students used libraries in problem based learning than in traditional programmes. Sanjeev Kumar and Mishra  (1993)  found  that  in  NIFT  library  users  were  visiting  library mainly for borrowing books followed by use of reference material and periodicals.\r\n\r\nJefferson and Hussain F (1998)2 conducted a study on “Using the internet as a teaching resource”.  It discusses how internet may be used to support learning and teaching, the motivation underpinning the need to use internet and the results show that in general spend 1 to 5 hrs on the internet during a week.\r\n\r\nPaul F Burton (1998)3 conducted a study on “Electronic Journals: A study of usage and attitude among academicians”.  The study aims to assess the attitude towards e-journals and examines the current level of use of these publications by university academics in five faculties. Consideration is given to both users and non-users, examining why they use  or  do  not  use  this  medium.  The  perceived  advantages  and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisadvantages of electronic publications are also examined. The principal limiting factor is that of time to find electronic journals; academics initially simply need time to come to terms with the new technology and to locate electronic resources.\r\n\r\nHart J L et al. (1999)4 emphasized the aspect that user education is to be provided for ensuring the optimum use of electronic resources. Here the authors argued that libraries should place greater emphasis on outreach  to  the  faculty,  improved  marketing  strategies  and  desktop access to information.   At Texas A and M University and increasingly greater portion of the University Library’s budget was being spent on electronic resources and services.   This study, a survey of a random sample of the faculty and teaching staff, was designed to determine whether these resources and services were being used by the targeted population and, if not, why.  The results of the study indicated that lack of information was the greatest obstacle to use the electronic resources/services.\r\n\r\nMajid  and  Abazova   (1999)5       conducted   a   study   entitled, “Computer Literacy and use of electronic information resources by academics: A case study of international Islamic University, Malaysia” and the study finds that persons who are computer literate are frequent users of internet and make best use of online resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChandran (2000)6 made a study on “Use of internet resources and services in S V University, Tirupathi”. The study has found that a connection to internet helps a user to access different kinds of services which are offered through internet such as e-mails, e-journals, online database, OPAC etc., The researcher has also attempted to measure the perception of academic community towards e-resources and the findings are that most of the users are in the age group of 20-29 and they use it for e-mail purpose.  Training should be given to make best use of the e- resources available on the internet.\r\n\r\nSaleh  Al-Baridi  and  Syed  Sajjad  Ahmed(2000)7   conducted  a study on developing electronic resources at the KFUPM University.  This paper presents an overview of the development of electronic resources at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals library.  It highlights the experiences   in   developing   these   electronic   resources   which   are essentially provided as an alternative to the print and microform collection, in order to satisfy the information needs with greater speed, accuracy and efficiency.\r\n\r\nAhmed, Syed Sajjad (2002)8 has explained the management changes necessary to enhance web-based services in the Arabian Gulf Libraries. The study aimed at analyzing as to how to manage changes and challenges faced by the libraries and for the foreseeable future, and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe study attempted to find the communication within. The objective of the study were to assess the current status of the web-based service offered  by the  selected  Arabian  Gulf  University libraries and to find methods for improving the awareness, providing orientation and training for users. The motto was to enhance the quality of web-based service.\r\n\r\nAdika Gifty (2003)9 has analysed that lack of access to current materials in libraries of universities in developing countries is a major problem that hinders research and teaching. Interlibrary loans and document delivery projects have not solved this problem by themselves. The Internet makes it possible for users to have access to large volumes of information irrespective of their geographical location. The three older universities in Ghana are all linked to the Internet. The assumption then is that their faculty now have access to current information through the Internet. Research results show that in spite of the benefits of the Internet, its use among faculty is still very low. The main reasons for this are lack of access to the Internet and the need for training. Clearly, university authorities need to take immediate steps to provide general access points for faculty through computer laboratories. Again, the expertise of librarians, information professionals and computer scientists needs to be tapped to provide training and refresher sessions for faculty \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto keep up to date on harnessing the immense potential of the Internet as a source of information for teaching and research.\r\n\r\nTinashe Mugwisi and Dennis N Ocholla (2003)10  attempted a study of internet use among academic librarians in the Universities of Zimbabwe and Zululand” (South Africa).  The purpose of the study was to examine internet use, trends by academics and librarians at the Universities of Zimbabwe and Zululand, with specific reference to the use of resources for research and teaching. A survey by means of a questionnaire was conducted among the study population at the two institutions.  Preliminary  results  indicate  high  computer  and  internet skills among librarians from both institutions. Inadequate training in the use of internet resources and lack of awareness among academics and other potential users are also highlighted.  Despite these problems, the study reveals that there is a great potential for internet use and appreciation   among   academic   librarians   and   users   in   the   two institutions.\r\n\r\nAnother survey was conducted by Choukhande and Kumar (2004)11 named “Analytical Study of Information Needs and Use Pattern of Faculty Members and Research Scholars of Amravati University.” Author concluded that the purpose of user’s visit to library largely depends up on the free time available to them. Teachers preferred book \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade catalogue, bibliographies, indexes, abstracts, addition lists issued by library and periodicals to know current literature in concerned fields. Purnima (2005) “Information Needs in Higher Education: A Study of College Faculties in Manipur.” Author ascertained the information needs of college and university faculties. Survey revealed that majority of the college faculty members needed information for academic work, whereas university faculty members needed information to update knowledge and for research work. Most of the faculties of colleges and university were unaware of the use of IT, because of lack of infrastructure in libraries.\r\n\r\nJudith Licea de Arenas, et al. (2004)12  have discussed about a growing concern for universities is developing a new educational model in which the student is educated both for future social responsibilities, and where information literacy is viewed as a lifelong learning requirement. Thus, there is a pressing need for empirical analyses to identify the extent to which university students are information-literate. Therefore, an investigation of university students from two institutions in the USA and Europe was carried out in order to determine how they use their libraries, information and computers. It was found that there were similarities and differences between the two groups of students from the University of Murcia, Spain, and the National University of Mexico. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVicente Angel de, et al. (2004)13 have discussed the use of electronic information services by staff at GCU. It is part of a wider study which reports on usage by both staff and students. It builds on previous work at Leeds Metropolitan University, and as the user population at GCU is well understood the outcomes contain useful baseline data for comparison. It reports on the views of 97 respondents out of an academic staff of about 700. The freely available Internet was the most widely used source, which some respondents viewed as a more appropriate source of vocationally orientated information than pass worded databases. Less than a third used the catalogue to find EIS, which raises questions about the future of the catalogue as a free-standing comprehensive resource. Non-use of EIS was rarely due to difficulty of access or use. Staff were pessimistic about their student's skill levels in using EIS.\r\n\r\nAdeyoyin, Samuel Olue (2006)14 have ascertained the information and communication technology literacy level among the staff of Anglophone (English-speaking) university libraries staff and their counterparts in francophone (French-speaking) university libraries in West Africa. A survey was conducted among the professionals, paraprofessionals and other members of staff of 28 university libraries comprising 24 anglophone university libraries and four francophone. The result  of  the  findings  showed  that  out  of  about  370  professional \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrarians, only 179 of them were ICT literate while the remaining 191 professional librarians were ICT non-literate. This constitutes an overall percentage  of  48.38  percent  for  the  literate  professionals  as  against\r\n51.62 percent for ICT non-literate professionals. Also, out of 526 paraprofessionals, only 84 of them were ICT literate while the remaining\r\n442 were ICT non-literate. This also constitutes 15.97 percent for the literate paraprofessionals as against 84.03 percent for ICT non-literate paraprofessionals. Other staff totaled 1,471. Only 190 of them were ICT literate while the remaining 1,281 were ICT non-literate. This also constitutes  12.92  percent  for  the  literate  other  members  of  staff  as against 87.08 percent for ICT non-literate other members of staff. Only two  categories  of  skills,  literacy  and  illiteracy,  without  gradations between these categories could be considered. The questionnaires were not design to catch the grades of these two categories of skills. The paper concludes that of all the 28 university libraries surveyed, only the 40\r\nSenegal university professional librarians have an ICT literacy level of\r\n\r\n100 percent. Thus other West African university libraries should encourage all their professional librarians, as well as other staff, to become ICT literate. The paper contains original work relating to the differences between English and French-speaking university staff as regards ICT literacy and as such will be useful for library technology planners and educators. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdikata and Anwar (2006)15  “Student Library Use: A Study of Faculty Perceptions in a Malaysian University”, revealed that teachers played an important role in promoting the use of libraries by students.\r\n\r\nAhmadu Bello University, Zaria”brought forward that power outrages,  slow  Internet  service  and  insufficient  computers  were  the factors affecting the provision and use of electronic information resources at Ahmadu Bello University.\r\n\r\nAhmed Elhafiz Ibrahim (2006)16  has reported findings from a survey conducted to measure the use and perception of the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) faculty members of electronic resources. The study pointed out that frequency of use of electronic resources was low; reasons cited were lack of time because of the time needed to focus on teaching; lack of awareness to electronic resources provided by the library; ineffective communication channels and language barrier.\r\n\r\nAll the researchers in science subjects frequently look for e-mails whereas 62 per cent researchers in social science and 20 per cent researcher in humanities have e-mail accounts.  The study recommends that academicians should be encouraged to use electronic information sources and they should be given proper training for the use of online information sources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmojorho, Daniel et  al.  (2006)17  have  analysed  a  study  that aimed at looking at the extent to which staff of Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria, are acquainted with and use information technology facilities for academic pursuit. The main instruments used for collecting data were questionnaires and interviews. Simple percentage was the statistical method employed. Data gathered through the use of the questionnaire and interviews reveal that most of the staff are not only aware of the existence of information technology (IT) facilities, but also employ them to satisfy their academic desires. From the study, epileptic power supply was adjudged the worst problem encountered in the use of IT facilities, while other problems include high internet service charges, unreliable telecommunication infrastructure, internet traffic congestion due to limited bandwidth and unsatisfactory performance of internet service provider. The study acts as an eye-opener to the staff and management of Delta State University, those of institutions of higher learning in Nigeria as a whole, as well as the government of the day, as to the true state of affairs relative to how far and well we have advanced in the application of IT for developmental purposes in a world that has gone so far in it, and try as much as possible to bridge the gap.\r\n\r\nFor the study 200 questionnaries were distributed among researchers: 80 for science, 80 for social science, and 40 for humanities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe findings of the study reveal that 90 per cent of Internet use by the researchers in science was for academic purpose whereas only 30 per cent in social science and 5 per cent in humanities use it for academic purpose.\r\n\r\nGenoni, Paul, et al. (2006)18 have discussed to explore the way in which the internet and e-research are changing the nature of scholarly communities and the relationship between researchers and libraries; and to suggest how librarians can become more engaged with the e-research process.  A  survey  and  focus  groups  investigating  internet  use  by academic staff and research students at Curtin University (Western Australia) for e-research and scholarly communication purposes. The survey questioned respondents on their formal and informal scholarly communication practices and the extent to which these have changed due to internet access. Further questions explored the extent to which respondents' use of the library had been impacted by internet access to services. The survey and focus groups indicate that research users are positive regarding the usefulness of the internet for research purposes and for expanding their scholarly community, but their attitudes are also marked by ambivalence. In particular they report that the internet may not replace the need for some more traditional forms of scholarly communication. Respondents report making less personal use of the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary, but greater use of library services. The paper concludes with observations   about   changes   to   scholarly   communities   and   the opportunity offered for academic librarians to develop the concept of e- research literacy as a means of enhancing their engagement with scholarly communities.\r\n\r\nKhaiser and Madhu (2006)19 “Expectations and Perceptions of the Users of the National Law School of India University Library (NLSIU): A Study”. Investigators ascertained the expectations and perceptions of users about the facilities and services offered by National Law School of India University Library. Total 150 questionnaires were distributed and\r\n124 were received back. It was found that 88% users visited library daily, but faculty members were not the regular visitors to library. All the users rated library as an excellent, very good or good. Users wanted easy access to library and new books on emerging subjects.\r\n\r\nManimekalai  A,  et  al.  (2006)20   in  their  study  “Internet  Use Pattern among the students  in Annamalai University” primarily focused on the extent and pattern of use of the internet among 150 students in Annamalai University.  The study investigated the relationship between motivational variables (intrinsic and extrinsic), demographic variable and the internet usage activities (messaging, downloading, browsing and purchasing).  The findings revealed that the higher the class, more the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusage of the internet resources.  Irrespective of the faculty or subject, the students’ work on the net was in the same frequency.  It was also shown that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment are the important drivers of internet usage.\r\n\r\nNaushad Ali and Hasan (2006)21 undertook a survey of teachers to  assess  the  library  and  information  services  of  Aligarh  Muslim University library under title “Library and Information Services in Central Library of Aligarh Muslim University from the Teacher’s Point of View: A Survey”. Approximately 86% users responded to questionnaire. Survey brought to light that most of the users were visiting library to collect teaching material and borrow books, while approximately 14% teachers visited for research purpose. Majority of the teachers were not satisfied with overall functioning of library.\r\n\r\nPreeti Mahajan (2006)22 brought out the level of internet use by researchers at Punjab University, Chandigarh, India. The author made an attempt to study the use of Internet, the level of usage and the usefulness of the Internet by the researchers at Punjab University in all three fields of education namely Science, Social Science and Humanities to find out their impact on their academic routines. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKinengyere, Alison Annet (2007)23     have revealed Uganda has gone a step forward in ensuring that information resources available for researchers and students are maximally utilized. Academic and research libraries are participating in supporting and achieving the missions of their respective institutions by teaching the competency of information literacy (IL). This paper seeks to examine the effect IL has had on the usage of electronic information resources in academic and research institutions in Uganda. It aims to focus on the innovations that Makerere University Library (the biggest and oldest academic library in Uganda) has undertaken to ensure that library users (the Makerere University community and other collaborating universities and research institutions in Uganda) are trained on how to access a variety of available information resources, evaluate the information and apply it to address their needs. Data were collected for the study using interviews to both library staff and users of the selected institutions: two library staff in charge of e- resources and ten students/researchers were interviewed from each institution. However, user statistics for the years 2004-2005, as well as the   IL   training   sessions   conducted,   were   the   main   sources   of information. The study focused on academic and research institutions - Makerere University, Uganda, Martyrs University, Nkozi and National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiradar B.S, et al. (2008)24  in their study explored university students’ and teachers’ perceptions regarding their use of search engines for retrieval of scholarly information. The study was conducted among teachers and students of Kuvempu University. The study also examined the factors that influenced the use of search engines, search strategy for information retrieval and the methods by which students and teachers learn skills for searching.  The study observed that 100% of students and\r\n97.9% of teachers used search engines for information retrieval.  Google and  yahoo  received  the  highest  overall  ratings.  It also  revealed  that majority of respondents took help from their friends and help option of search engines to develop the skills for searching.\r\n\r\nKanniyappan, et al. (2008)25 in the article “use and impact of e- resources in an academic and research environment; a case study” described briefly  a survey conducted at Anna university library, Chennai to find out the use of different types of electronic resources and services and their impact on the academic development of faculty members. Also described the problems faced in using the electronic resources and satisfaction of users in getting the required information. Analysis of 150 filled questionnaires from the different categories of teaching community revealed that all the respondents used computers, online services and majority of them used e-journals, internet, WWW for the research and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudy purpose. Majority of the respondents felt that printed journals will not become obsolete in the near feature and most of the faculty members were aware of the availability of e-resources.\r\n\r\nSadanand Y Bansode and Shamprasad M.Pujar (2008)26 conducted  a  study  to  understand  the  purposes  of  use  of  internet, methods of locating information and search techniques used in retrieving the information by the research scholars of Shivaji University,Kolhapur. The study found that research scholars use internet for their research and communication purposes. It conclude that more awareness about internet resources and training in the use of the same needs to be provided by library professionals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sharma (2009)27, the second highest preference in terms of e-resources usage after e-journals is the Web and e-mail with 30 (57.69%) and 41 (78.84%) among teachers, whereas 23 (76.66%) and 18 (60.00%) among research scholars use them, respectively.\r\n\r\nKaur, Baljinder and Verma, Rama (2009)28  have analysed the issues like use of electronic information resources, its impact on the collection of print and electronic journals its awareness among the users, and the places where the users are accessing these resources.  A survey was  conducted  in  the  academic  year  2006-07  at  Thapar  University, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatiala. A total number of 504 users from the undergraduate, postgraduate, research scholars and faculty members were selected and their response was obtained with the help of questionnaire. The findings show that the users from all these categories were using e-resources; the awareness about e-resources encourages users to use such resources to the maximum; and the users are using computer centre and hostel more for accessing the information. The impact of e-resources was visible from the decrease in number of printed journals in comparison to the increase in number of electronic journals. The use of e-journals has increased manifold.  The  printed  materials  is  being  quickly  replaced  by  the electronic resources.\r\n\r\nKhan, Abdul Mannan and Ahmad, Naved (2009)29  have found out the level of awareness and use of e-journals by the researchers of the Aligarh  Muslim  University  (AMU)  and  the  Banaras  Hindu  University (BHU) - both central universities funded by the University Grants Commission. A well-structured questionnaire is administered to the research scholars of the AMU and BHU to collect data regarding the use of e-journals. The survey reveals that most of the research scholars are aware of the availability of e-journals and largely use them for reference purposes in their research work. They fully agree that with the usage of e-journal  the  quality  of  research  work  improves  with  enrichment  of \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappurtenant contents and materials leading to high-quality manuscript. It is however found that lack of training is the obstacle in proper and full utilization of e-journals. The present paper consists only of e-journal users and the geographical area is restricted to AMU, Aligarh and BHU, Varanasi. The scope of the paper can be extended to additional centrally funded universities. An intra-comparative study could also be made between some select central and state universities for users of e-journal. There are a number of studies on the use of e-journals, but this is the first of its kind within Indian central universities. As such, it should pave the way for research in other Indian universities as well as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPatil and Parameswar (2009)30 conducted a study on the use of electronic resources by the faculty members and research scholars in the Gulbarga University, Gulbarga. The data for the study was collected through questionnaire and analysed to understand information needs of the faculty members and research scholars in various PG Departments in the university. The study revealed that the electronic resources available  in  the  Gulbarga  University  Library  were  much  helpful  in fulfilling  their  information  needs.  It  was  found  that  the  necessary training must be given to the teachers and research scholars in using electronic resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGES:-\r\n\r\nLord J (2003)31 has discussed various aspects of access to electronic journals at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). RCN had been offering remote access to electronic journals since 2001. Ensuring that the service was used effectively by the RCN’s large membership with different information literacy skills in UK and abroad is a challenge. A study outlined the various strategies employed to meet that challenge. RCN library and information services also worked with RCN Colleagues, developing the award winning online learning zone to ensure that the e- journals are promoted within an online learning environment.\r\n\r\nLawoe (2006)32  brought forward during study of serials use at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Library, Kumasi that undergraduates were using journals significantly, as lecturers were recommending them. Gaps were found in collection development.\r\n\r\nVaishali Choukhande (2007)33  studied the “Use of Resources by research scholars  in College Libraries of Amaravathi City” with special reference to electronic resources.  The main objective of the study is to ascertain the main channel of communication in the changed and changing environment, to study the use, acceptance and impact of electronic   resources   over   traditional   ones   and   to   ascertain   the researchers’ preference for information sources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARY:-\r\n\r\nGupta (1973)34 “Users Survey of the Laxmibai Nagar Branch of the Delhi Public Library”. Author examined the characteristics of users, use pattern, and users’ views about collection, services and facilities. Half of the respondents considered library collection inadequate while all most all the users were satisfied with services of library. Biswas et al. (1986) executed a survey titled “Central Secretariat Library: Users and the Pattern of Use-A Survey” to identify real users, their information needs, pattern of use and scope for new services. Survey led to conclusion that shortage of space has effected library collection and services.\r\n\r\nKrisiddappa et al. (1989)35  “Information Use Pattern of Indian Historians”. Questionnaires were distributed to 150 persons and 121 responded. It had been found that majority of the users were using books/ monographs frequently followed by use of journal articles. Almost three fourth of the users were facing problems in getting up to date information\r\n\r\nDupuis E.A. (1997)36 discusses that technological changes that are occurring rapidly and the students entering colleges are bringing very disparate computer skills and attitudes. Some students are reluctant to embrace new technology; others demand electronic resources for all assignments. By considering the computer access and Internet resources \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\navailable  to  the  elementary  school  students  today,  it  is  possible  to imagine what a user will expect from the libraries tomorrow. Although college students may arrive at libraries with increased computer skills, their knowledge of electronic information may be lacking. It defines the information literacy with an overview of information literacy skills. The Digital Information Literacy programme at Texas University at Austin serves as a case study for integrating information literacy skills into traditional services and partnerships.\r\n\r\nSharma P.L. (1998)37 Describes that Information technology (it) involves computers, electronic media, and satellite, telecommunication and storage devices. It has made a deep impact on the academic libraries. The emphasis of these libraries is shifting from collection to access. Academic libraries in India still face several challenges due to the emergency of IT. It lists all the challenges and deals in detail about one of the foremost challenges, i.e. manpower development in the context of IT. It discusses the  provision of raising the facilities  on  IT  in  the  library  schools,  inclusion  in  curriculum,  short  term training facilities by other organizations, refresher courses, participation inn workshops, seminars, conferences, conventions etc. For their own survival and for survival of the profession, the librarians have to play their role effectively in future; otherwise they will be replaced by a new group of professionals.\r\n\r\nWilkinson F.C. (2000)38  Describes that the electronic references are becoming an increasingly greater part of reference publishing and reference \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollections. At present an interview – style discussion among several US academic librarians and publishers, who provide valuable insights in to the current and future position of print and electronic reference materials and reference publishing. Topics covered include: the proportion of a reference collection in electronic format and the proportion of reference titles published in electronic format; the extent to which publishers are abandoning print version of reference resources and the librarian’s reactions to this trend; the impact on librarians and publishers about the marketing of electronic resources that have as their core existing print resources along with the expanded or updated materials and links; and the importance of the usage of statistics for electronics resources.\r\n\r\nCarol Hansen Montgomery, (2000)39 This paper addresses another important  organizational  impact  triggered  by  the  migration  of  electronic journals that has received little attention in the literature: the changes in the library’s  operational  costs  associated  with  shifts  in  staffing,  resources, materials, space  and equipment. A common assumption is that converting library journals to digital format will ultimately improve the library service and lower  costs,  but  this  is  yet  to  be  proven.  Understanding  the  total  costs associated with the library model for delivering digital information has now become a requirement for library survival since in the digital world, as opposed to print, the library has many viable competitors, Our goal is to develop a framework for assessing the shifts in personnel and costs that can be used for \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanning and budgeting at Drexel and provide guidance to other academic libraries which are not yet so far down this path.\r\n\r\nLarge and Beheshti (2000)40 in their study, “The web as a classroom resource: Reaction from users” have found that the internet is seen as an important resource, but not at the expenses of traditional sources.  Multimedia aspects of the way are not used to its full potential, because it is very difficult to incorporate the medium directly into an assignment expressing sound or action which takes considerably more cognitive effort and time than using text or pictures.\r\n\r\nCrowley K, et al. (2001)41 have worked on the emerging research communities and the WWW. The study aimed at contrasting the possibilities of the WWW to transform communities of educational researchers with actual patterns of the use of the Museum Learning Collaborative web site. The findings of the study included the highlight patterns of user interaction that have emerged and discussed the problems and opportunities of  creating shared research resources in emerging fields such as museum learning research. The finding had direct implications for three stakeholders; program finder, project researchers and the larger museum research community. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDulle, et al. (2001)42  has assessed the capability of agricultural libraries in meeting researchers' information needs, finding out means used by researchers to cope with the scarcity of scientific information, and based on study findings, give some recommendations on how to improve agricultural library services in Tanzania.\r\n\r\nIkoja-Odongo (2001)43 ascertained the information needs of informal economic sector in Uganda under title “A Study of the Information  Needs  and  Uses  of  the  Informal  Sector  in  Uganda: Preliminary Findings”. Author examined the use of information and role and impact of information in the growth and development of concerned sector. Opinions of population under study were collected through focus group discussion, interviews of informants and organizations and observations. Study revealed the need for simplification of information packaging and improvements in its delivery.\r\n\r\nLally Elaine (2001)44  studied the perspective of researchers on electronic scholarly communication.   The study explored the scholarly traditions and technological changes among researchers.  Scholars were visiting the libraries to keep abreast of new developments in their field and had their own subscription to import journals in their field concerned. The study has showed that internet has changed all this surprisingly. The study argues that researchers and research institutions \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed to find new ways of working together in order to understand and take full advantage of the emerging forms and media for scholarly communications.\r\n\r\nShaheen Majid, et al. (2001)45 have investigated the factors that contribute positively in shaping users perceptions of library effectiveness. A questionnaire-based survey of five major agricultural libraries in Malaysia was conducted. It was found that the adequacy of collections, services and facilities were closely linked to the perceptions of library effectiveness. Certain other factors contributing positively to the perception of library effectiveness were the adequacy and effectiveness of library promotion, involvement of users in the selection of library materials, convenient library location, participation in user education programmes, availability of assistance for using library resources and facilities, and subject background of library professionals. The paper suggests that for any reliable library effectiveness study, all factors associated with user satisfaction should be investigated together.\r\n\r\nSukovic.S  (2002)46   discusses  that  the  appearance  of  electronic  text within the libraries during the past several years ha been a significant development for booth the library and research communities. At the same time, electronic texts have become a great challenge to the traditional roles in the library,  research  and  publishing  communities.  Development  of  electronic \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntextual  resources  mean  dealing  with  the  documents  in  new  ways  and  in different levels, often involving work on a document’s content through text encoding. This development challenges the library’s assumed position in the research process. Discussing were done about why libraries should be involved in text encoding, particularly since text encoding affects information access and preservation, which are traditional library tasks.\r\n\r\nChing, et al. (2002)47 have revealed that knowing how the library's collection is being used and how patrons are feeling about its collection are important for the evaluation of the library collection. The former can be measured by conducting library collection use studies and the latter through a user survey method. Another method is to check library holdings against standard bibliographies. The citation analysis technique was chosen to evaluate the collection of the Ministry of Education library, Singapore. Results were counter checked with ILL data analysis results. Books were the most cited (96 per cent) resources followed by journal articles (1.5 per cent) and 69 per cent of the citations were published between 1980-1994. The library had only 20 per cent of the citations and the rest were supplied through ILL. Results show a need for a change in acquisition policy with more focus on books, reduction in non-used journals, and development of an efficient ILL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller, R.G (2002)48  explores the issues related to the selection and purchase of digital content in academic libraries, including commercially-produced databases, electronic journals, and books and other electronic resources that are purchased from vendors and in-house digitization projects. Considers the degree to which standard collection management principles apply.\r\n\r\nSannaTalha and Hanni Maula (2003)49 conducted a study entitled “Reasons for the use and non use of e-Journals and databases: A domain analytic study in four scholarly disciplines”. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the development of a domain analytic approach for explaining the use and non use of e-journals and databases. They identified and defined factors to account for disciplinary differences in e- journal use, outlined hypotheses to be tested more rigorously in future research, and test them initially on a limited data set. The empirical data were gathered as a part of a wider qualitative study exploring scholars’ use of networked resources in four different disciplines: nursing science, literature/cultural studies, history and ecological environmental science. The findings suggest that e-journals and databases are likely to be used most heavily in fields in which directed searching is the dominant search method and topical relevance the primary relevance type, and less in fields in which browsing and chaining are the dominant search methods \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand paradigmatic relevance the primary relevance type. The findings also support the Bates hypothesis that domain size has an important impact on the search methods used.\r\n\r\nVan Brakel P (2003)50  revealed that intranets and portals are supposed to provide an infrastructure through which end-users can gain effective access to information sources needed to assist in daily tasks such as effective decision making, planning and research. This paper discusses the current lack of clarity on how to address the external information issue in conjunction with the current popularity of portals and their multiplicity, emphasising in particular the confusion in regards to what constitutes each portal type. The issue of definition intensifies when the term information portals becomes added to the current list of portal categories. Do the latter belong to a unique category of portals or should it rather be seen as an umbrella term for other portals? When is a portal an information portal? To conclude, what should a strategy entail to  ensure  that  external  information  sources  are  perceived  by  an enterprise as of strategic importance?\r\n\r\nWagner, A.B (2003)51 provides an overview of the development of electronic resources over the past three decades, discussing key features, disadvantages, and benefits of traditional online databases and CD-ROM and Web-based resources considers the decision to shift collections and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources toward purely digital formats, ownership of content, licensing, and user interfaces.\r\n\r\nPalmer,  J.P  and   Sandler,  M  (2003)52   discuss  the  choices academic   libraries   are   making   between   digital   collections   and maintaining print collections and describes results of interviews with faculty at the University of Michigan that investigated their use of print and  electronic  journals.  Topics  include  convenience;  access;  books versus journals; differences between subject areas; and archiving.\r\n\r\nAnjali Gulati (2004)53  discusses the status of information and communication technologies usage in Indian libraries with special reference to special libraries and the efforts made by various institutions to propagate e-information products and services. This paper highlights the   consortia   efforts   in   India   like   JCCC   Consortium,   INDEST Consortium, CSIR E-journal Consortia, and UGC Infonet. It further discusses digitisation efforts in India at NISCAIR, New Delhi, IIITM, Kerala, C-DAC Pune, and the Digital Library of India. In addition it incorporates  details  on  major  information systems in India (such as NISSAT) and major library networks in India (such as INFLIBNET, DELNET,  CALIBNET  etc.).  The  paper  concludes  with  challenges  for library  and  information  science  professionals  and  an  overview  of initiatives taken by Government of India. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrinkley Franklin and Terry Plum (2004)54 made a study on the “Library usage patterns in the electronic information environment”. This paper examined the methodology and results from Web-based surveys of more than 15,000  networked electronic services users in the United States  between  July  1998  and  June  2003  at  four  academic  health services libraries and two large main campus libraries serving a variety of disciplines. A statistically valid methodology for administering simultaneous web-based and print-based surveys using the random moments sampling technique was discussed and implemented.   At the two main libraries, there were approximately 1.3 remote users for each in-house  user  of  electronic  information.  Sponsored  research  (grant funded  research)  accounted  for  approximately 32% of the networked electronic services activity at the health sciences libraries appeared to use networked electronic services most intensively from on-campus, but not from the library. The purpose of use for networked electronic resources by patrons within the library is different from the purpose of use of those resources by patrons using the resources remotely. The implications of these results on how librarians reach decisions about networked electronic resources and services are discussed.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Kiondo (2004)55   discussed about the emerging issues in  selection  and  acquisition  of  electronic  information  resources  in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacademic libraries of developing countries paying particular attention to the  situation  at  the  university  of  Dar  es  Salaam  Librarian.  First discusses in historical perspective the application of information technology in provision of information services and specifically the provision of electronic information services at this university. Then it identifies emerging and challenging issues related to selection and acquisition of electronic information resources. The emerging issues include the information technology skills of staff and users, technology infrastructure, financial resources and collection development and management policy.  In conclusion, the paper strategizes the way forward to make selection and acquisition of e-resources contribute towards promotion of research, scholarly communication, teaching and learning at African universities.\r\n\r\nHaruna   (2004)56    “Utilization   of   Information   Resources   and\r\n\r\nServices of the Kogi State Public Library, Lokoja, Nigeria”,found that\r\n\r\n40.9% users of a public library were partially satisfied with library material and were using it because they did not have any other alternative. Swarna (2004) invited the opinions of students and teachers about B.Ed. college libraries in Andhra Pradesh on library collection, services, opening hours, facilities, rules and regulations, reading facility and organization of documents etc. Helen (2005) “The 2004 User Survey \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat the University of Hong Kong Libraries”evaluated the University of Hong Kong libraries and found that majority of the respondents preferred to use online journals than print versions, but on the contrary about 72% users preferred to use printed books over the electronic.\r\n\r\nJames Cory Tuckera and Matt Torrenceb (2004)57  expressed that there are many challenges facing new librarians in the academic environment, including collection development. This article analyses the topic of collection development and how it relates to new professionals in the  field  of  librarianship.  The  article  contains  a  literature  review  of papers discussing the collection development curriculum in library and information science programs, expected skills required of collection development offices, and library training programs for new librarians. The article also provides practical advice by recent graduates and their collection development experiences. Topics of discussion include acclimation to a new environment, collection development policies and procedures, liaison work, resource selection, and time management.\r\n\r\nPhillips Linda L and Williams Sara R (2004)58  have analysed collection  development  and  management  literature  of the  past  seven years reveals distinct trends among issues, philosophy, and practice. Digital age themes reflect the increasingly networked nature of the profession, with new attention focused on scholarly communications and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublishing, digital collection building, consortia collaboration, and quantitative assessment. Some issues that dominated the library literature a few years ago, such as access versus ownership and organizational structure, have been eclipsed by other challenges, such as the serials crisis, finance and budgeting, and licensing. Neither solved nor   forgotten,   have   they   taken   backstage   to   trendier   subjects. Publications on organization, training, professional development, management of print collections, and subject-oriented collection development from 1997 through 2003 generally indicate reliance on traditional skills and knowledge even though practitioners are applying practical approaches to new formats and types of media. More theoretical commentary on fundamental changes emanating from an increasingly networked   environment   comes   from   authors   who   explore   the implications of collection building in the digital age and challenge readers to imagine a vastly different future for collection development practice.\r\n\r\nShaji (2004)59 has conducted a study “Internet Cafes in Kerala: A user analysis” by visiting 30 internet cafes in Kozhikode and Malapuram Districts for examining the URL accessed by the users.  The study aid a questionnaire survey among users and 46 questionnaires were used for analysis; It revealed that majority of the internet café users belong to male  and  student  categories.  Majority  of  café  users  have  average \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomputer  awareness  and  the  major  source  of  getting  awareness  is friends.   The study also found that internet has not led to any considerable change in the reading habit of the users.\r\n\r\nVivian Ramzy and Sajjad Ur Rehman (2004)60  have discussed about the under- utilisation of electronic resources.  According to their study,  electronic  resources  are  vital,  but  extremely  expensive  and medical libraries are genuinely concerned about their effective use.  It is a widely held view that low awareness and poor skills are among the primary reasons for their under-utilization.\r\n\r\nGulati, Anjali, (2004)61 in his paper discusses the status of information  and  communication  technology  usage  in  Indian  libraries with special reference to special libraries and the efforts made by the various institutions to propagate e-information products and services. This paper highlights the consortia efforts in India at NISCAIR, New Delhi, IITM, Kerala, C-DAC pune, and the Digital Library of India. In addition, it incorporates the details on major information systems in India (such as INFLIBNET, DELNET, CALIBENET etc.). The paper concludes with challenges for library and information science professionals and an overview of initiatives taken by the Government of India. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAni  Okon  E,  et  al.  (2005)62   have  investigated  the  extent  of adoption   of   information   and   communication   technology   (ICT)   in university libraries in Nigeria. Postal survey was the instrument used for data collection. Almost 60 per cent of the University Librarians out of the\r\n29 university libraries surveyed. The results of the survey show that only six university libraries are fully computerized nine are about to be computerized; seven of the surveyed libraries have installed local area networks, five have online public access catalogue and only four libraries provide internet service. The major obstacles that influence effective adoption of ICT in university libraries are inadequate funds and the poor state of electricity in Nigeria. The federal government should increase the present level of funding of Nigerian university to improve the library development fund, which is the major source of funding available to university libraries. The poor state of electricity in Nigeria should also be improved by the federal government for sustainable adoption of ICT by university libraries. The paper proposes that computer networking of university libraries is feasible and recommends the development of the Nigerian university libraries network and academic libraries network.\r\n\r\nAsemi, Asefeh (2005)63 has determined the present status of familiarity and use of digital resources. It was felt that use of digital resources is still poor among the medical students of the universities in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe developing countries.  This study investigated the familiarity and use of digital resources by students through on-line and off-line databases of the Central Library, Central Library Books and Journals Database (CLBJD), and the CD Roms available in the4 academic libraries (MUI). The study revealed that the use of e-resources is associated with the familiarity of the same. The major reason is less use of off-line databases are  infrequent  periodic  orientation  and  education  to  use  off-line databases and these databases may not meet the information needs of the students.\r\n\r\nFabrizia Bebilacqua (2005)64 has investigated at the university of Parma e-journals titles from a user view point, in order to find out what influence the approach adopted by the library may have on the use of e- journals and what characteristics the organization of e-journals should have to enable and easy discovery of resources. The group of users appeared still reluctant to use e-journals, the main barriers to use being lack of awareness and limited number of relevant resources. Users were favourable to being provided with multiple points of access to e-journals. Their preference appeared to be based on the familiarity of the method and   similarity   to   the   organization   of   the   physical   library.   The organization of e-journals adopted at Parma had the potential to meet the users  expectations,  but  its  actual  implementation  seemed  to  require \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore effective promotions and user –centered design. This paper may prove useful to humanities librarians engaged in providing user effective organizations of e-journals and in encouraging researchers and students to use e-journals.\r\n\r\nMohammed Haneefa K (2005)65  has investigated the use of   e- resources in special libraries in Kerala.  The study explored the specific factors that promoted or hindered the use of electronic resources. It was conducted in 30 libraries. The study reported that majority of the special libraries in Kerala have no OPAC, even though most of them are at various stages of computerization. The study revealed that very few libraries are using commercial online databases. Only two libraries have a separate Digital Library. Only three special libraries are participating in library consortia and this is for accessing for e-journals. The study also revealed that all the special libraries in Kerala are providing e-mail and WWW facilities. Majority of the libraries are under study are providing access to e-journals.\r\n\r\nPaul A, Manda  (2005)66  has  focused  on  the  use  of  electronic resources available through the Programme for the Enhancement for Research Information (PERI) of the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP) in ten academic institutions in Tanzania, but the use of other resources is also considered. Although \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboth staff and students have the capacity to access the electronic resources, there is a danger that the variations in the levels of adoption and use of these resources will lead to an information gap between institutions and individuals scholors and researchers. Problem identified and included limited availability of basic technical and human resources, limited access to PCs by students, inadequacy of the end users training and limited levels of use of PERI resources. The paper made policy recommendations on training in the use and marketing of electronic resources for specific user groups and resources.\r\n\r\nTamar Sadeh and Mark Ellingsen (2005)67 have revealed an overview of the trends and standards in electronic-resource management (ERM). This paper examines the challenges that rapid growth in the number of electronic resources and in the complexity of managing e- collections has posed for libraries and traces the progress in developing tools and setting standards to address such challenges. Particular emphasis is given to the work of the Digital Library Federation Electronic Resource Management Initiative (DLF ERMI) to develop ERM systems not only for managing e-collections throughout their life cycle but also for aiding collection-development decision making. The integration of such systems in existing library environments and the mechanisms that make such  integration  possible  are  highlighted.  This  discussion  will  help \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrarians who struggle with the challenge of e-resource management to set their expectations about the potential of future tools to assist them in their tasks.\r\n\r\nWallis, Jake (2005)68  has  argued  that there is a need for an information  literacy  skill  set  for  citizens  of  the  modern  information society, and that the role of library and information professionals may have  to  evolve,  from  intermediaries  to  facilitators  and  trainers.  An opinion piece based on the author's experience in digital library research, as a citizen of an information society and as a worker in the knowledge economy. That citizens of information societies have direct access to a bewildering range of digital information resources. Librarians and information professionals face less demand for their traditional role as intermediaries. Information literacy is defined and described as a vital skill  set  for  citizens  of  information  societies.  It  is  suggested  that librarians and information professionals are needed to pass on these skills to citizens at all levels of society for economic, social and personal empowerment. The paper reflects the perspective of the author - it is not supported by quantitative data (notoriously difficult to collect on information literacy). Provides suggestions on how the library and information profession can retain their relevance to society in the networked age. This is the particular viewpoint of the author, with a \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiverse range of examples cited to back up the thrust of the paper. It describes how information literacy is required to interact effectively with the digital environment on an emotional as well as an intellectual level.\r\n\r\nNaushad Ali, (2005)69 to examine the use of electronic information services (EIS) among the users of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) library in Delhi, India, both questionnaires and observational methods were used for data collection where 300 valid samples were collected. The analysis of data collected covers the awareness pf EIS services, use of e- journals, advanced search facilities, acquaintance with electronic information sources, the purpose of using e-information, problems faced by the users while using EIS, infrastructure facilities available and the satisfaction level of the users. It is found from the study that Boolean logic and truncation are the most often used search facilities by IIT users. Lack of printing facilities, terminals and trained staff are the major reasons that would discourage the users from  accessing the EIS. The  survey  also  reveals  that  some  60  per  cent  of  the  users  face difficulties while browsing e-information.\r\n\r\nAppleton, Leo (2006)70 reported upon the design, implementation and  findings  of  a  research  study  investigating  the  perceptions  of electronic library resources within the UK further education sector. While such resources are widely available to the sector, very little qualitative \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestigation has been done as to its impact upon teaching and learning and how it is viewed by those who have access to it. The research uses a case  study  in  which  staff  and  students  at  three  separate  further education colleges are encouraged to explore and share their experiences of using electronic library resources. This is achieved through structured interviews with teaching staff and focused student discussion groups. Extensive reference to relevant literature is also employed as a method. The findings of the research are entirely qualitative, and are reported through a sequence of annotated quotations, which reveal personal experiences and perceptions of using electronic library resources and the influence and impact they have had on teaching and learning activity. The findings are limited to one case study, using three different colleges in the Merseyside area of the UK. The qualitative data provided through the research provides insight into electronic resource use within a cross section of the further education sector. It is therefore of use to those studying  the  impact  of  electronic  resources,  particularly  within  the further education sector. The research provides evidence which can be used to inform future e-resources policy. The findings can also be used to shape e-resources guidelines for practitioners in the further education sector. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing, Sandie et al. (2006)71 have investigated  a survey into staff perceptions of the UK-wide information and communications technology (ICT)  training  conducted  under  the  People's  Network  programme  for public library staff. A web-based survey was undertaken across several prominent UK mailing lists, seeking staff views on issues such as the usefulness of the training provided, and any perceived gaps in training that existed. The survey also asked what types of ICT queries staff regularly  encountered.  It  was  found  that  while  the  staff  found  the training   rewarding,   there   were   concerns   at   the   lack   of   ICT troubleshooting in the programme, and the reliance on an off-the-shelf training programme not specifically designed for libraries, namely the European Computer Driving License, or ECDL. The paper suggests that ICT training for library staff should be built around problem solving and troubleshooting, rather than generic skills, in order to match the kinds of queries encountered in the front line of libraries. The paper is useful for anyone involved in designing library training programmes, or for researchers or students interested in the ICT skills necessary for librarians and the types of ICT queries encountered in the workplace.\r\n\r\nKorobili, Stella et al. (2006)72 have examined the use of library resources, focusing on e-sources, by the members of the faculty of a higher educational institute in Thessaloniki, Greece; to reveal the factors \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich influence the effective use of sources for academic duties; and to provide reliable information to both the administration and the library of the institute, with the aim of the improvement of library services. A census survey, using a structured questionnaire, among the faculty of the Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki was conducted to examine the frequency of use of resources, mainly e-sources, and to reveal the impact of demographic or academic situational characteristics, the assumed positive influence of academic productivity, perceived usefulness of resources and access to e-sources on the use of e-sources as well as the assumed negative influence of barriers and computer anxiety on the use of e-sources. The great majority of the faculty of TEI uses printed sources more than e-sources, but they also use e-sources quite frequently. Use is mostly of books, websites and printed journals. It was also found that the use of e-sources is higher in the School of Business Administration and Economics among those who hold a PhD degree and among younger members of the faculty. Also, the results indicated that the use of e-sources is positively influenced by the respondents'  perceived  usefulness  of  resources,  the  convenience  of access to the sources and their academic productivity. The examination of the computer anxiety rating scale (CARS) provided evidence that the less anxious the faculty feel about PCs, the more frequent users they become. Further research is needed to measure how faculty interact with \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation, what kind of electronic sources they prefer, what search strategies they use, as well as whether their information needs are satisfied. This research needs to be duplicated to other universities in Greece to determine whether the results can be generalized for Greek academic faculty. University administrations need to improve library facilities, to include more workstations for access to electronic sources, as well as to improve the marketing and communication of these e- sources. This research tries to fill a gap in the literature, which has underemphasized so far the need for assessing and measuring the use of library resources in Greek academic libraries and the examination of the factors that influence this use.\r\n\r\nMargaret   Markland   (2006)73     in   the   study,   Institutional repositories in the UK: What can the Google user find there? Investigated the efficiency of the Google search engine at retrieving items from 26 UK institutional repositories, covering a wide range of subject areas.   One item is chosen from each repository and four searches are carried out: two keyword searches and two full title searches, each using both Google and then Google scholar.  A further search tests the retrieval of the item from the repository interface.  Known information seeking behavior was taken into account when interpreting the results.   However some skill would be needed to evaluate the different versions of texts retrieved and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccessing the repositories through more sophisticated harvesting services might prove a better option for the scholar.\r\n\r\nOmekwu and Charles Obiora (2006)74  have discussed a critical overview of the contribution of information technology to the current shift from information to knowledge processing. It situates that shift in the context of the management challenges for librarians from the developing countries. The approach adopted was to review the development challenges of developing countries, the in-trends information handling and the transition from information to knowledge management systems. The next approach was to examine statistically, the internet usage status and information and communication technology facilities in Africa. Based on the data provided and discussed the final approach was to draw up critical roles for developing countries' librarians in the knowledge age. The  findings  indicate  the  abysmal  state  of  internet  usage  and  ICT facilities in Africa in particular and the rest of the developing countries in general. Librarians will be called upon to provide authentic and reliable information, evolve strategic alliances, participate in network activities and contribute to the bridging of the digital divide. They will emerge as technology experts, guides, scouts, researchers, analysts, knowledge engineers, editors, navigators, gatekeepers, brokers and asset managers. Conclusively, librarians will need to acquire new skills to access net \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources,  and  develop  new  strategies  and  services  to  meet  the challenges of the knowledge age. The results and discussions imply that it is critically important for information professionals from developing countries to begin to re-evaluate their roles in terms of how they contribute to the management of technology and information in the knowledge age. They must participate in information and knowledge creation, undertake information resources documentation, provide an information identification service and evolve new means of resource preservation.\r\n\r\nRay Lonsdale and Chris Armstrong (2006)75  have investigated the role of the University Library in delivering information literacy skills relating to the use of e-resources to secondary schools in the UK. Six forms of collaboration were identified with a range of levels of information literacy skills evident. Collaboration is characteristically ad hoc, with little involvement of sectoral collaboration for school pupils. A fundamental lack of understanding of the respective roles of secondary school and university librarians was demonstrated.  The first qualitative study  that  has  explored  the  issues  surrounding  information  literacy skills relating to the use of e-resources across the secondary and tertiary education sectors in the UK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSami, et al. (2006)76  have reviewed  the impact of information technologies on users of libraries and to understand the problems encountered in their information technology (IT) usage by reference to the concept of \"technostress\", the inability to cope with the new computer technologies in a healthy or positive manner. A literature review was undertaken to further our understanding of the influence of IT based services on the users of libraries. The paper provides a literature derived set of information about library users who initially find it difficult to cope with the new technology and experience anxiety (termed \"IT anxiety\", \"technostress\" or alternatively \"technophobia\"). This is bound to affect their adoption of IT technologies negatively. They may eventually begin to avoid contact with computers. Since this avoidance strategy is highly impractical in the modern IT dependent world, the various causes of technostress must be analysed, so that users can be trained to overcome technophobia. The conclusions in the present paper are based on articles from different sources and not on any field study. Being a review article, it reflects the problems encountered by a range of users in different countries. The paper also pragmatically provides factors to be considered in  designing  a  training  module.  The  paper  organises  information collected from different sources and presents a consolidated picture of the problems encountered by users in exploiting computers in libraries, while suggesting the means to overcome these problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafley, E (2006)77 provides an in-depth literature review of e-book usage and a discussion of how different e-book collections were used in a university. In conclusion, safely argues that “the demand for all things electronic is infiltrating into monographs in the form of e-books” and that “the closer libraries can get to giving customers segments of text, the more useful the item becomes.”\r\n\r\nKibbee, J (2006)78 investigates issues faced by academic research libraries  in  providing  virtual  reference  services  to  unaffiliated  users. These libraries generally welcome visitors who use on-site collections and reference services, but are these altruistic policies feasible in a virtual environment? This paper reviews the use of virtual reference service by unaffiliated  users  to  determine  their  expectations,  assess  level  of demand, and provide recommendations on how libraries should respond. Virtual  reference  desks  can  serve  their  primary  constituency  and function as a public good for external users if they understand and articulate their role as mediators in the information seeking process.\r\n\r\nVan Scoyoc, A.M and Cason, C (2006)79 examine undergraduate students' research habits in a strictly electronic library environment at a large public university. Unlike most information commons, the campus' electronic library is not housed within a traditional library space and provides access to electronic research materials exclusively. This study \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinds that undergraduate students in this electronic library rely primarily on Internet sites and online instruction modules (for example Blackboard or  WebCT)  for  their  research  needs  rather  than  university-funded research sources. Additionally, academic class status has no significant impact on whether students use either the library's OPAC or the university-funded electronic databases for their research needs. The authors discuss possible reasons for these findings, new pedagogical practices as indicated by the results, and define areas for further research.\r\n\r\nLeo Appleton, (2006)80 The purpose of this paper is to report upon the design, implementation and findings of a research study by investigating the perceptions of electronic library resources within the UK to promote the education sector. While such resources are widely available to the sector, very little qualitative investigation ha been done as to cast its impact upon teaching and learning and how it is viewed by those who have access to it. The findings of the research are entirely qualitative, and are reported through a sequence of annotated quotations, which reveal personal experiences and perceptions of using electronic library resources and the influence and impact they have had on teaching and learning activities.\r\n\r\nDon Dickenson, (2006)81     As a part of the 2006 Colorado Academic Library Impact Study, undergraduate students and the faculty from nine Colleges and universities were asked to provide information about the services \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  used  at  their  institution’s  library.  They  were  also  asked  about  their success  in  accessing  the  resources  through  their  won  library  and  other libraries. Computer access is utilized by the students far more than by the faculty.\r\n\r\nThe use of interlibrary loan services is much more widespread among the faculty  members  than  the  students.  Only  slightly  more  than  half  of  the surveyed faculties (52%) feel that they can usually find the print periodicals they need through their institution’s library.\r\n\r\nAlison (2007)82  stated that to examine the effect of Information Literacy has had on the usage of electronic information resources in academic and research institutions in Uganda.  It aims to focus on the innovations that Makerere University Library (the biggest and oldest academic Library in Uganda) has undertaken to ensure that library users are trained on how to access a variety of available information resources, evaluate the information and apply it to address their needs. Information Literacy is very vital in influencing utilization of e-resources. Information Professionals are needed to pass on IL skills to library users, while library users should endeavour to find out what information is available online for their consumption. Their attitudes and perceptions also influence the level of utilization. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Marie Johnson (2007)83 has discussed the information may be used by librarians and interested parties as a quick reference to literature on library instruction and information literacy. The purpose of this paper is to set out to provide a selected bibliography of recent resources on library instruction and information literacy. Provides information about each source, discusses the characteristics of current scholarship and describes as sources that contain unique scholarly contributions and quality reproductions.\r\n\r\nBarbara Elam (2007)84  studies the “Readiness or avoidance: E- resources and the art historian”. The aim is to study the information seeking behavior of art historians. The study emphasis on the impact of electronic resources and digital image databases on the research methodologies of today’s art historians. Although art historians depend on using the library for research, many have a limited awareness of electronic resources and have not fully developed the skills to utilize them to their fullest potential.\r\n\r\nCook Sir Albert (2007)85  has studied “The effect of information literacy on the utilization of electronic information resources in selected academic and research institutions in Uganda”.  The aims of the study were to find out whether Uganda moved a step forward in ensuring information   resources   available   for   researcher   and   students   and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaximally utilized, to find whether academic and research libraries were participating in supporting and achieving the mission of their respective institutions by teaching the users on how to access a variety of available information resources, evaluate them and apply them to address their needs.\r\n\r\nDavies, Ron (2007)86 has described the experience of developing a library portal to provide integrated access to research information at the same time as an institutional or enterprise information portal was being implemented. The paper presents a case study. Valid grounds for implementing vertical, specialised library portals alongside horizontal institutional portals include reduced risk, faster implementation and reduced maintenance costs. Organisations seeking to provide integrated access  to  distributed  information  resources  must  consider  library portals. This case study reveals that in practice there is little risk of overlap between institutional and library portals. Both types of product are   complementary.   However,   some   integration   issues   remain   a challenge.\r\n\r\nIn research article “Expectations and Perceptions of the Users of Public Libraries in Mysore City: A Survey” Nikam and Chandershekra (2007)87  examined the expectations and perceptions of users including children,  young  adults,  women  and  old  towards  public  libraries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinions of 200 users were collected through a structured questionnaire. About 90.50% users considered public libraries either as more important or extremely important. Users were not satisfied with the helpfulness of library  staff.  Respondents  did  not  find  it  easy  to  locate  the  needed reading material from libraries.\r\n\r\nJanine Schmidt (2007)88  has highlighted that as the younger generation  of  born  digital  library  users  and  even  well-established scholars rely increasingly on Google, or its new products for information resource  discovery  and  access,  libraries  are  finding  it  increasingly difficult  to  ensure  that  their  own   well  structured  websites  and information services are being utilized appropriately.  This paper aims to highlight some of the changes occurring in the information environment and suggests ways of marketing library services effectively to today’s users. The paper finds that libraries no longer operate in a “come and get it” environment and new ways of outreach are described which ensure that librarians arte out amongst their communities, creating an awareness  of  the  services  available  and  ensuring  effective  use  of resources through a variety of approaches used in university libraries in Australia and at McGill University in Montreal., Canada.   This paper provides useful information on the changes occurring in the information \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvironment and ways of marketing library services effectively to today’s\r\n\r\nusers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKumbar et al. (2007)89 “Use of Periodical Literature in the University of   gricultural Sciences Daharwad: A Case Study”examined the extent of use of periodical literature by agriculture scientists and found that most of the users considered print journals as better version than electronic journals, as 74.36% chosen print journals and 25.64% opted for electronic version.\r\n\r\nMargam Madhusudhan (2007)90 has examined the use of internet among the research scholars of the Central Science Library (CSL), University of Delhi.  The prime objective is to find out the current trends in information search through internet by the research scholars and type of problems faced by them in their research work. The study finds that Boolean logic, truncation and wildcards are the most often used search techniques, web directories, while subject gateways are least used navigational tools, and the researches are beset with the problems of inadequate computers with internet facilities, slow internet connection and lack of skills and training.  This is the first comprehensive study of the use of the internet by the University of Delhi science research scholars. Its findings should help CSL, University of Delhi in its plans and programmes related to effective and efficient use of internet to fulfill \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation requirements of the research scholars and also proposes proper internet searching training to research scholars to keep up-to- date on harnessing the immense potential of the internet as a source of information for their research work.\r\n\r\nBoissy, R et al., (2007)91  present an informative overview of the changes in journal publishing and subscription management from mid\r\n1990’s through mid 2000’s. The authors devote the first half of the article to discussing how publishers and subscription agents handled pricing of print journals. The second half focuses on those two parties’ practices of managing electronic journals.\r\n\r\nHernon, P et al., (2007)92 examine the possible cessation of print journals from different perspectives. For librarians, an electronic-only journal environment would lead to questions about perpetual access, faculty’s reaction, and a subscription agent’s role. For authors and readers, there would be concerns over the integrity of published works, the change in citation rates, and reliable and affordable access. Publishers, on the other hand, would have to consider authors’ and subscribers’ reactions as well as journal branding. The author also discusses various issues involved in archiving electronic journals. In conclusion, she states: “If we want to end print, we must have bullet- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproof digital archiving of electronic journals. We are making progress, but there are many, many issues still to be settle\r\n\r\nJohnson, R.K and Luther, J (2007)93 examine the issues associated with moves toward electronic-only publication of journals, based on interviews with academic librarians and journal publishers. Noting  that  publishers  and  libraries  today  find  themselves  in  an extended transition zone between print-only and e-only journals, the report investigates forces driving change for libraries and publishers, particularly financial exigencies and user expectations. Just as libraries are straining under the burden of subscribing to dual formats, publisher financial statements also reflect the additive effect of producing dual formats. However, the responsibilities of the library to support users and provide long-term access can act as brakes on the transition to e-only journals and a move to e-only entails adjustments to a publisher's marketing and production operations as well as cultural adjustments to the online publishing environment. As these adjustments are made, the report concludes that the role of the printed journal in the institutional marketplace faces a steep decline in the coming 5 to 10 years. Issues emerging from this study suggest the need for a fuller examination of and response to obstacles impeding the transition of journal articles fully into the digital networked environment, including: (1) New business models; \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) User expectations; (3) Publisher success stories; (4) Library success stories; (5) Preservation; and (6) Version of record.\r\n\r\nChinnasamy K et al. (2008)94  made a survey on the usage of electronic resource by management students of Jansons School of Business, Coimbatore. They also studied the impact of electronic resources on the academic work.  The study reported that the students used electronic resources for academic and the frequency of   use was very high.\r\n\r\nGopalakrishnan et al. (2008)95  “Information Use Pattern by the Academicians: A Case Study of NIFT Centres in India”. A survey was conducted to examine the information needs and information use pattern of the academicians of seven institutes of fashion technology in India. Authors suggested having functional and effective collection development programme to meet information needs of users and need to popularize the  less  used  services  to  ensure  their  optimum  utilization,  conduct regular user education programmes, acquire both print and non-print material, move towards digitalization, etc.\r\n\r\nJacquline  Borin  and    Hua  Ji  (2008)96   have  analysed  that currently  there  is  a  need  for  an  updated  assessment  model  that addresses and reflects the ongoing diversity of issues related to collection \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevaluation in academic libraries.  The purpose of this paper is to provide conceptual guidelines and a model to support collection evaluation and assessment in this time of unstable and constantly changing patterns of information.  This  paper  bridges  two  different  collection  evaluation models, collection-based and user-based. It provides a different perspective to a body of literature that is mostly best practice-based. The new model suggested here addresses a current need generated by a changing information environment.  It adds a new approach to the body of literature in the area of collection evaluation.\r\n\r\nLakan (2008)97      “Availability    and    Utilization    of    Electronic\r\n\r\nInformation Databases by Staff of the Agricultural Complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPertti Vakkari (2008)98 explored how the use of electronic information resources had influenced scholars’ opinion of their work, and how this connected to their publication productivity.  The data consisted of  a  nationwide  web-based  survey  of  the  end-users  of  FinElib,  the Finnish Electronic Library, at all universities in Finland.   Scholars felt that the use of electronic literature had improved their work considerably in several ways. This influence could be differentiated into two dimensions. The first one was improved accessibility and availability of literature, and the second was more directly related to the content and quality of scholarly work.  The more direct influence of e-resources use \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non the content of scholarly work was, however, not associated with publication productivity. The results seemed to imply that investments in academic  digital  libraries  were  beneficial for researchers and for the universities.\r\n\r\nSelwyn, Neil (2008)99  has addressed students’ engagement with the internet as a source of academic information for their studies. In particular  the  article  explored  how  academic  information  for  their studies. In particular the article explored how academic use of the internet is patterned by a range of potential influences such as students’ wide internet use, access and expertise, their year of study, gender, age ethnic and educational background.   Analysis of these data suggested that students’ academic internet use is most strongly patterned along the lines of gender and subject-specialisation rather than other individual characteristics or differences in technology or expertise.\r\n\r\nNelson, M.R (2008)100 looks at some of the hype and the reality of e-books in higher education. An e-book is an electronic book that can be read digitally on a computer screen, a special e-book reader, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or even a mobile phone. In other words, e-books are consumed on a screen rather than on paper. However, underlying this simple and seemingly obvious definition are some important distinctions that may make an e-book something other than just a \"PDF \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nversion of the printed book.\" These differences lie in the electronic nature of e-books, which are changing the nature of what a \"book\" is within an electronic context. Higher education is expected to be at the forefront of the wave  of  e-book adoption  over  the next two years. Some experts predict that 2007-2009 will be transition years for the higher education e-book market, with large growth expected in both digital textbooks and digital library collections. Publishers and campuses alike are exploring the use of e-books and other forms of digital content. Such explorations in the educational markets may signal a tipping point in e-book usage on college campuses from occasional oddity to a mainstream technology in less than five years.\r\n\r\nGowda and Shivalingaiah (2009)101 conducted a study under title “Attitude   of   Research   Scholars   towards   Electronic   Information Resources: A Survey of University Libraries in Karnataka” to examine the preference of research scholars towards print and electronic resources and effectiveness of usage of e-resources among users. Nearly 58.12% respondents indicated their preference towards print resources over electronic resources. The preferences of users depended upon the nature of resources available in libraries, while usage of electronic resources depended upon the type of IT infrastructure available in libraries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMahesh, G et al. (2009)102  have identified the modes of digital content creation for digital libraries and discuss the associated copyright issues with the types of digital content. Prevalent copyright laws in India in the context of digital content have been studied and issues related to specific types of digital content have been discussed. In addition to two known types of digital content, namely born digital and turned digital, a third type, gained digital has been delineated. It is found that extant copyright laws, particularly in India, allow scope for forming opinions with regard to digital content thereby giving room for insecurity for digital content  creators.  Copyright  laws  in  the  context of World Intellectual Property Organization and India only have been discussed. The paper will be useful to digital content creators and digital library managers/administrators to understand copyright issues relevant to the digital library. The classification of digital libraries based on content as has been delineated in this paper is an original work and has reported for the first time. The linking of digital content with the copyright issues makes it useful.\r\n\r\nShashi P Singh (2009)103 stated that  power point presentations were used  in a demonstration to explain how to use various types of e- resources and databases, both subscribed and in the public domain. Based on the feedback analysis, it was found that instruction materials \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas useful (94.90%), 88.47% respondents are now better prepared to use e-resources and WWW services and 92.80% of respondents agreed that the programs were suitable for their information needs.  Regarding the post-program awareness of e-sources, 94.01% of respondents agree that they are now more aware. An information literacy skills demonstration package was prepared for regular use with faculty members, research scholars and post graduate students to make them competent to find access and   use information more efficiently.  This would fulfill the aim of developing individuals’ intellectual capabilities of independent and lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nSudharma Haridasan and Majid Khan (2009)104  have analysed that electronic resources are a significant part of library collections. A large amount is invested in the development and management of e- resources in the libraries.  The study aims to identify the acceptance of e- resources in the National Social Science Documentation Centre (NASSDOC) library in New Delhi, India and determine their usage, performance, degree of user satisfaction, and barriers faced in the access of  e-resources.    It also  attempts  to  find  out  the  users’  views  about computer literacy among the social scientists. The major findings of the study indicate that respondents are aware of the e-resources. Large number of research scholars and faculty members are using these e- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources for their research work. Many faculty members strongly agreed with the necessity for computer and internet literacy to access information. A majority of users were satisfied with the e-resources available at the NASSDOC library.   This is one of the first survey conducted  to  identify  the  need  and  importance  of  e-resources  in  a specific Indian library (NASSDOC) as well as the requirement for information literacy to enhance the use of available resources in the social sciences.   It should pave the way to show the value of such e- resources for scholarly research in India.\r\n\r\nSwain  Dilip  K  and  Panda  K  C  (2009)105    in  their  study entitled”Use of electronic resources in business school libraries of an Indian state: A study of librarians opinion”, looked at the prolific growth of electronic resources during the last decade.  This survey attempts to measure the quantum of e-resources accessed in the academic ambience Business School Libraries in Orissa (India). Furthermore, the study aims to highlight problems and constraints faced by the information professionals in accessing e-resources and delivering electronic information services with some constructive suggestions and remedial measures   for   the   ensuing   bottle-neck.   The  paper   highlights  the availability of e-sources and critically examines the quantum of their use in Business School Libraries of Orissa and the crucial role played by the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation professionals in providing electronic information services to users through the findings based on responses from structured questionnaires.  The SPSS package is used for the analysis of data.  The paper arrives at the conclusion that the internet-based e-resources are being well used compared with CD- ROM databases.  Premier web search options like Google and Yahoo!   Are the most frequently used search engines, while the other searching options are less used.  Availability of some key online databases is exclusively confined to only a selected few B-school libraries of the State.\r\n\r\nSudha, S.T and Harinarayanan N.S (2009)106 Use of e-resources by professional and non professional College students and its optimum utilization level of satisfaction derived and the problems encountered while browsing information and felt fairly better satisfaction by suing E- Resources to support their academic and research activities.\r\n\r\nTahir, Mohammed, et al. (2010)107  have assessed the  use of electronic information resources and facilities by humanities scholars at the universities of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. The humanities still stick to the printed information sources but they pay good attention to electronic sources. Most of them have access to computer and internet at office and home. Keeping in view the positive trend of the humanities towards modern technology, universities and libraries should give more funding \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto provide electronic resources and facilities in the arts and humanities disciplines. Special training programme for faculty of humanities should be organized. This is the first study on this topic in Pakistan. The results can be useful to design services and facilities in humanities and libraries and information centers in Pakistan and other developing countries.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe  majority  of  the  study  focuses  on  the  use  of  internet  in academic institutions.   The survey method was adopted for the study and random sampling techniques were used to select the sample for the study.   Multivariate analysis, regression and correlation analysis were used to analyse the data.  The review of related literature of both Indian and foreign studies has revealed that very few attempts have been made to study e-resource usage among University teachers and research scholars.  Hence,  the  researcher  has  made an attempt  to study the “Impact of e-resources and User Perception in Professional Education: A Study on Puducherry region”. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tKanakachary, M.

This chapter deals with the sampling procedure used for selection of study area and the respondents. It also deals with the variables selected for the study procedures used for measuring the variables, data collection methods and statistical tools used for analysing the data.\r\n\r\n4.1 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\n1.\tTo   find   out   the   users   attitudes   and   approaches   towards e-resources and services in the academic libraries of Pondicherry Union Territory.\r\n2.\tTo  evaluate  the  electronic  resource  use  pattern  among  the respondents in the study area.\r\n3.      To  know  the  existing  e-services  in  the  academic  libraries  of\r\n\r\nPondicherry Union Territory.\r\n\r\n4.\tTo  know  the  various  sources  used  by  the  respondents  in  the affiliated\tarts  and  science  colleges  and  Pondicherry  Central University library.\r\n5.\tTo examine the extent of use of the library facilities and services made to the Faculty, research scholars and students. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\tTo determine the relative of different sources of library information used by the respondents.\r\n7.\tTo  know  type  of  internet  search  engines  used  to  collect  the required information.\r\n8.\tTo    assess   respondents‟  satisfaction   on    the   availability  and utilization of library resources and services.\r\n\r\n4.2 HYPOTHESES Meaning\r\nHypothesis may be defined as a proposition or a set of propositions set forth as an explanation for the occurrence of some specified group of phenomena either asserted merely as a provisional conjunction to guide some investigation or accepted as highly probable in the light of established facts. Quite often a research hypothesis is a predictive statement, capable to some dependent variable.\r\n\r\nThe following hypotheses are formulated on the basis of content and coverage of framed objectives and they are tested by employing appropriate statistical techniques:\r\n    Users   differ   in   their   assess   and   approach   towards   the e–resources of affiliated arts and science colleges to Pondicherry Central University. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Users differ in their opinion about  e - services for various affiliated arts and science colleges to Pondicherry Central University.\r\n    There  is  a  significant  difference  in  the  sources  used  by  the affiliated colleges library.\r\n    There is a significant difference in the extent of use of the library facilities and services made to the faculty and students.\r\n    Users differ in their sources of information used for their purpose.    Users differ in type of internet search engines used to collect the\r\ninformation\r\n    Users differ in their satisfaction on the availability and utilization of library resources and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3. METHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nResearch methodology is a way to systematically solve the research problem.  It may be understood as a science of studying how research is done scientifically. In it, we study the various steps that are generally adopted by a researcher in studying the  research problem along with the logic behind them.\r\nThe preparation of the research design, appropriate for a particular research problem involves usually the consideration of the following;\r\n1. The means of obtaining the information\r\n\r\n2. The availability and skills of the researcher and his staff (if any); \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Explanation  of  the  way  in  which  selected  means  of  obtaining information will be organized and the reasoning leading to the selection.\r\n4. The time available for research;\r\n\r\n5. The cost factor relating to research, i.e., the finance available for the purpose.\r\n\r\n4.4 SAMPLING\r\n\r\nIn  this  research  the  researcher  selected  12  arts  and  science colleges affiliated by the Pondicherry Central University and One Pondicherry  Central  University.  100  samples  were  selected  randomly from the Pondicherry Central University. Further from the 12 arts and science colleges, 100 samples from each college were taken as the sample on the basis of stratified random. Out of 12 arts and science colleges four self-finance and eight government colleges were covered. Therefore totally\r\n1300 samples were selected and questionnaires were distributed individually.  Among  them  1250  questionnaires  were  selected  for  the study as samples and the remaining 50 questionnaires were rejected due to incomplete responses.\r\n\r\n4.5 DATA COLLECTION\r\n\r\nThere  are  two  type‟s   data  viz.,  primary  and  secondary.    The primary  data  are  those  which  are  collected  by  the  researcher.  The \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecondary data, on the other hand, are those which have already been collected by someone else and which have already been passed through the statistical process.  The researcher would have to decide which sort of data he will be using for his study and accordingly, he will have to select one or the other method of data collection.\r\n\r\nThe methods of collecting primary and secondary data differ since primary data are originally collected while in case of secondary data, the nature of data collection work is merely that of compilation.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of collecting the appropriate data which differ considerably in context of money, time and other resources at the disposal of the researcher.\r\n\r\nPrimary  data  can  be  collected  either  through  experiment  or through survey.  If the researcher conducts an experiment, he observes some quantitative measurements, or the data, with the help of which the researcher examines the truth contained in his hypothesis.  But in the case of a survey, the following ways are used to collect the data:\r\n\r\nSidney and Beatrice Webs stated that,  “A widely broadcast questionnaire is usually available for anything more than obtaining data of the statistician. It may be furnish confirmation of hypotheses, but it is very rare that it brings to light facts of structure and function not already \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith in the knowledge of the investigator, or at least definitely suspected\r\n\r\nby him to exist.”\r\n\r\nA well–structured interview schedule was used for the collection of data. Interview schedule was prepared in English by the student researcher for administration Before finishing the interview schedule it was pre-tested in a non-sample area to identify the inconsistencies and later necessary change were made in the interview schedule.  The copy of the finalized English interview schedule is given in Appendix I. Data collected were processed and tabulated for statistical analysis.\r\nResearch design into the following parts:\r\n\r\na. The sampling design which deals with the method of selecting items to be observed for the given study;\r\nb. The observational  design which relates  to the conditions  under which the observations are to be made;\r\nc.  The  statistical  design,  which  concerns  with  the  techniques  by which the procedures specified in the sampling, statistical and observation designs can be carried out.\r\nFeatures of a research design:\r\n\r\n1.\tIt is a plan that specifies the sources and types of information relevant to the research problem.\r\n2.\tIt  is  a  strategy  specifying  which  approach  will  be  used  for gathering and analysing the data. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tIt also includes the time and cost budgets since most studies are done under these two constraints.\r\n\r\n4.6 DATA ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA simple percentage analysis was carried out on the data extracted from the questionnaire based on domain, gender and designation etc.,\r\n\r\n4.7 STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES USED\r\n\r\nTo test the hypotheses, Analysis of Variance (Two way ANOVA), t-test and Chi-square test was carried out.    The general data interpretation is done with the application of percentage analysis. The diagrammatic and graphical representations of the data are also made on requirement of the study.\r\n\r\nCross tables, Chi-square test, t-test and One-way ANOVA were used in the study by using Statistical Software SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences).\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nPercentage refers to a special kind of ratio.  Percentages are used in making comparison between two or more series of data to describe the relationships.   Percentages can also be used to compare the relative terms, the distribution of two or more series of data \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo of Respondents\r\n%      =                                                 100\r\nTotal no of Respondents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\nA very important aspect of the sampling theory is the study of tests of significance which enable us to decide on the basis of the sample results if:\r\n1. The deviation between the observed sample satisfaction and the hypothetical parameter value is significant.\r\n\r\n2. The deviation between two sample statistics is significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL TECHNIQUES USED\r\n\r\n  Descriptive analysis (Mean and Standard Deviation),   Inferential analysis\r\n\r\nThe   means,   standard   deviations   of   the   entire   sample   are computed. In order to test the significance „t‟ test is used. In order to find out the significance of more than two variables, 'F' test is also used in this present investigation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na. Mean\r\n\r\nThe mean of a distribution is commonly understood as the arithmetic average. It is perhaps the most familiar, most frequently used and well understood average.\r\n\r\nThe mean of a set of observations or scores is obtained by dividing the sum of all the values by the total number of values.\r\n\r\na) for ungrouped data\r\n\r\n\r\nM=\r\nN\r\n\r\nb) for grouped data\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nM= A.M+        x i\r\nN\r\n\r\nb. Standard deviation ( )\r\n\r\nThe average of squared deviations of the measures of scores from their mean is known as the variance. The standard deviations is the positive square root of variance.\r\na) for ungrouped data\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n=\r\nN\r\n\r\nb) for grouped data \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2                       2\r\n(      )\r\nN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Differential analysis\r\n\r\nDifferential analysis is an important procedure by which the researcher is able to make inferences involving in the determination of the statistical significance of difference between groups with reference to selected variables. It involves the use of „t‟  test. A „t‟  test is  a numerical procedure that takes into account that the difference between means of two groups, the number of subjects in each group and the amount of variation of  present in  the score. Thus the „t‟  test is  used to determine whether the performance of two groups is significant or not.\r\nd. t-Test\r\n\r\nStatistics  will  help  us  to  find  whether  one  group  differs  from another set or not. We calculate the mean of each group and then find out whether the means of the two groups differ or not. To find out the difference between two means we use „t‟ test.\r\ne. 'F' test\r\nIn order to find out the significant difference of three and more variables, 'F' test is used. The formula for the 'F\" test is\r\n \r\n\r\nF ratio =\r\n \r\nmean square between mean square with in \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHI-SQUARE TEST\r\n\r\nThe Chi-square test whether we are given a set of observed frequencies obtained under some experiment and we want to test if the experimental result support a particular hypothesis or theory.\r\n\r\nThe steps involved chi-square tests are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Observed frequencies O are tabulated.\r\n\r\n2. Expected frequencies E are calculated.\r\n\r\n3. The  difference  between  observed  and  expected  frequencies  are obtained and square of these difference are tabulated (O-E )2.\r\n4. The  values  of  (O-E)2   obtained  in  step  3  are  divided  by  the respective expected frequency and the total (O-E )2 / E is obtained.\r\n5. The calculated of X2  is compared with the table value of X2  for given degree at a certain level of significance (generally 5% or 1% level selected).\r\n\r\nBy degrees of freedom we mean the number of classes to which the value can be assigned arbitrarily if at the 5% or 1% level of significance the calculated value of X2, the difference between theory and observation is considered to be significant. On the other hand, the calculated value of X2   is  not  considered  as  significant  i.e.,  it  is  regarded  as  due  to fluctuations of sampling and hence ignored. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(O-E) 2\r\n2      =\r\nE\r\nO        =     Observed frequency\r\n\r\nE         =     Expected frequency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.8 CONCEPTS\r\n\r\nThe following concepts are operationally defined for the purpose of the present study.\r\n\r\nInformation:\r\n\r\nInformation is a sensible statement, an opinion, fact, concept, an idea or an association of statements, opinions or ideas”.\r\n\r\nUsers:\r\n\r\nUsers are the person come and seek information in the library for their needs.\r\n\r\nUser studies:\r\n\r\nUser studies‟ comprises the study of people‟s need for,  and use of, information. A user study may be defined as a systematic study of information requirements of users in order to facilitate meaningful exchanges between information systems and users. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation channels:\r\n\r\nChannels are the means by which ideas, opinions, facts, and interpretations are communicated. These channels may be formal books, journals, research reports, slides, audio-tapes, gramophone records, films-or  inform-after-dinner  discussions,  casual  meetings  with colleagues, correspondences.\r\n\r\n4.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\nThe study is restricted to only students, research scholars and faculties of Pondicherry Central University and affiliated arts and science colleges in Pondicherry. The study lacks in evaluating the fund generation, fund utility and expectation due to lack of information. Though, the researcher  circulated 1300  questionnaires a proper replay has been received from 1250 respondents only and those   1250 respondents  perfectly answered  questionnaires are selected  and such respondents  are  considered  as sample for the  study . In this library performance has been analysed mainly from the point of view of the users. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.10 NEED FOR RESEARCH DESIGN\r\n\r\nResearch design is needed because it facilitates the smooth sailing of the various research operations, thereby making research as efficient as possible yielding maximal information with minimal expenditure of effort, time and money.\r\n\r\n4.11 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\r\n\r\nLibrary  is  one  of  the  important  resource  for  inputting  the knowledge to the human being. Especially in the colleges the Library play a significant role for the teachers, scholars and students to enrich their knowledge and also to know their latest information.  In the present situation every where e-resources play a significant role. Studying of effectiveness of e-resources and the users attitude about e-resources are very  significant  one  for  any  libraries  for  their  development.  In  this context, the performance of the college libraries are very significant one. So the researcher make an attempt to adjudication of the performance by the Library users in the arts and science colleges affiliated to Pondicherry central  university.  Through  the  evaluation the colleges have an idea regarding the updation and further development also they are able to know the users attitude about the Library services.

The target group of this study includes faculty members, Research Scholars and students of Pondicherry central university and affiliated arts and science colleges. The target respondents in other affiliated colleges of Pondicherry central university, Tamil Nadu are not included in this study as this study coming under the preview of case study. There is a scope for other future researchers to take this area for the study. The geographical area of this study is confined only to Pondicherry central university students. This study related to the available online information centres such as Pondicherry central university library at various departments, offices and students amenities centers on campus.\r\n\r\n4.13 TOOL FOR COLLECTING DATA\r\n\r\nFor this study both primary and secondary data are collected. The primary data are collected from the faculty members, Research scholars both  M.Phil  and  Ph.D.  and  students  of  arts  and  science  Colleges Affiliated to Pondicherry Central University. Secondary data are collected from various Books, Journals, Magazines, Newspapers and records of the selected institutions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Observation:\r\n\r\nThis method implies the collection of information by way of investigator‟s  own   observation, without interviewing the  respondents. The information obtained relates to what is currently happening and is not complicated by either the past behavior or future intentions or attitudes of respondents.  This method is no doubt an expensive method and the information provided by this method is also very limited.   As such this method is not suitable in inquiries where large samples are concerned.\r\n\r\nThrough Personal Interviews:\r\n\r\nThe investigator follows a rigid procedure and seeks answers to a set of pre-conceived questions through personal interviews.  This method of collecting data is usually carried out in a structured way where output depends upon the ability of the interviewer to a large extent.\r\n\r\n4.14  SAMPLING TECHNIQUE\r\n\r\nFor this study stratified Random sampling method was adopted for collecting Primary data. There are users in colleges affiliated to Pondicherry Union Territory. A sample including faculty members, research scholars and students were chosen from each of the sample size. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of 12 arts and science Colleges and one Pondicherry Central University, 1250 samples were selected for the present study. They were selected randomly.\r\n\r\n4.15 SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter the research design, objectives, hypotheses, sample size and techniques and statistical techniques used are clearly explained.
