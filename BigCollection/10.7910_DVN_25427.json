The report describes the collecting and analysis of cross-national higher education data for the group of eight âflagshipâ universities in Africa. It concludes with an analysis of performance which focuses on the links between high-level academic staffing resources and high-level knowledge outputs.  These eight universities are described as flagship universities because each is the most prominent public university in its country, and because all of the universities have broad flagship goals built into their vision and mission statements.
