The Watch Your Car program (WYC), sponsored by the  Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), involves motor vehicle owners who  voluntarily place stickers in the windshields that alert police that  they can stop the car for a theft check during certain hours of the  night and in certain locations. On-site interviews were conducted with  WYC administrators from Arizona, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, and  Massachusetts. For the remaining WYC member states, the member survey  was distributed in advance of a phone interview with instructions to  review and answer the survey. During the telephone interview, the  survey was reviewed and there was discussion of issues that were  brought up by the respondent or by their answers to the survey  questions. If the WYC administrator had not completed the survey by  the time the site visit or telephone interview was conducted, they  were asked to return the completed survey form as soon as possible.  Follow up calls were made to the administrators of WYC programs who  had not returned the survey. In order to find contact information for  non-WYC states and the ten cities with the highest vehicle theft  rates, relevant state or city police web sites were reviewed looking  for specific information about vehicle theft prevention. If there was  a phone number specifically for vehicle theft prevention, it was  used. Otherwise, the main police information phone number was  used. The purpose of the call was explained and contact information  was collected on the person to whom the survey about vehicle theft  prevention methods could sent. For nonmember states, the contact  information usually led to an individual within the state police,  highway patrol, or department of public safety. For the ten cities,  the contact information usually le\nd to an employee within the police  department. It was thought that there may be regional difference in  the way motor vehicle theft prevention was handled, and therefore  seven versions of the survey for the non-WYC states were created.  Likewise, three versions of the survey for the ten cities with the  highest motor vehicle theft rates were created. The surveys were  regionalized by asking respondents how certain aspects of their region  of the country or their city might impact their approach to motor  vehicle theft prevention. The groupings for the regional state surveys  were based on geographic region with consideration given to the  influence of such factors as proximity to international borders and  ports. Except for the regionally oriented questions, the format and  content of the questions within the surveys was held constant. As the  site visits and interviews with the WYC member states came to a close,  the regional surveys to the motor vehicle theft prevention  administrators in the nonmember states and the ten cities with the  highest motor vehicle theft rates were distributed. As the response  rates began to slow for these two groups, electronic versions of the  nonmember and city surveys were created. In an attempt to increase  the response rate, these electronic forms were sent by email to those individuals and agencies who had not yet responded."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Part 1, the survey for Watch Your Car (WYC) program  members consisted of 48 open and closed-ended questions that were  divided among five major sections including: how they learned about  the WYC program, their WYC related program activities, the outcomes of  their program, ways in which they might have done things differently  if given the opportunity, and summary questions that asked WYC program  administrators for their opinions about various aspects of the overall  WYC program.
