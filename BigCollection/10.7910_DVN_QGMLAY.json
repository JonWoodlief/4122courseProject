In this replication, we examine the robustness of their findings, by disaggregating their measures of political opinions, to identify what is driving their results, and extending their logic to other related measures of substantive interest that were not originally considered, but are available in the original survey data. We revise their models where they would be more appropriately estimated as binary or ordinal instead of linear regression, and present quantities of interest for clearer interpretation. Through these extensions, we more precisely identify where the effects of the draft lottery on political attitudes are, and explore the pathways through which it operates."}}]},{"typeName":"publication","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"publicationCitation":{"typeName":"publicationCitation","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ROBERT S.
