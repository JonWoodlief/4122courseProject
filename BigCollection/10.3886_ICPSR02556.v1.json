The project sought to identify and connect local  attorneys' needs for information with the best knowledge available on  the most effective prosecution methods. In order to appraise domestic  violence prosecution in the United States, the researchers mailed a  survey to a nationally-representative sample of prosecutors to assess  prosecution strategies in domestic violence cases (Part 1,  Prosecutors' Survey Data). Smaller jurisdictions had such a low  response rate to the initial survey that a modified follow-up survey  (Part 2, Prosecutors' Follow-Up Data) was administered to those  jurisdictions. From these surveys, the researchers identified three  sites with pioneering specialized domestic violence prosecution  programs: Duluth, Minnesota, King County, Washington, and San  Francisco, California. In these three sites, the researchers then  conducted a case file analysis of a random sample of domestic violence  cases (Part 3, Case File Data). A survey of a random sample of female  victims was also undertaken in King County and San Francisco (Part 4,  Victim Interview Data). In addition, the researchers conducted on-site  evaluations of these three specialized programs in which they  interviewed staff about the scope of the domestic violence problem,  domestic violence support personnel, the impact of the program on the  domestic violence problem, and recommendations for the future. The  qualitative data collected from these evaluations are provided only in  the codebook for this collection. Parts 1 and 2, the Prosecutors'  Surveys, contain variables about case management, case screening and  charging, pretrial release policies, post-charge diversion, trial,  sentencing options, victim support programs, and office and  jurisdiction demographics. Questions cover the volume of domestic  violence prosecutions, formal protocols for domestic violence  prosecution, ways to deal with uncooperative victims, pro-arrest and  no-drop policies, protection orders, types of evidence used, and  collaboration with other organizations to prosecute domestic violence  cases. In addition, Part 1 includes variables on diversion programs,  victim noncompliance, substance abuse problems, victim support  programs, and plea negotiations. Variables in Part 3, Case File Data,  deal with reporting, initial and final charges, injuries sustained,  weapons used, evidence available, protection orders issued, victim  cooperation, police testimony, disposition, sentence, costs, and  restitution for each domestic violence cas\ne. Part 4, Victim Interview  Data, includes variables concerning victims' employment history,  number of children, and substance abuse, opinions about the charges  against the defendant, decision-making in the case, and prosecution  strategies, and victims' participation in the case, amount of support  from and contact with criminal justice agencies, safety concerns, and  performance evaluations of various levels of the criminal justice system."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The purpose of this project was to evaluate the  level of domestic violence prosecution throughout the United States  and to promote effective prosecution approaches through dissemination  of information.

From these surveys, three sites with pioneering,  specialized domestic violence prosecution programs were identified:  Duluth, Minnesota, King County, Washington, and San Francisco,  California. Next, case file data were collected from a random sample  of cases disposed from these three sites. Information was gathered on  discovery and report, violation and charging, case processing,  disposition and sentencing, and defendant and victim  characteristics. Victim interviews were also conducted in King County  and San Francisco. Victims were chosen from a random sample of  disposed cases for which case file data were collected. Those  respondents willing to participate in telephone interviews were asked  questions about their demographic characteristics, experiences with  the criminal justice system, victim safety issues, and level of  interaction with criminal justice and other professionals. Victim  interviews were not conducted at the Duluth site because of  difficulties in locating potential respondents. In addition, the  researchers conducted on-site evaluations of these three specialized  programs in which they interviewed staff about the scope of the  domestic violence problem, domestic violence support personnel, the  impact of the program on the domestic violence problem, and  recommendations for the future.
