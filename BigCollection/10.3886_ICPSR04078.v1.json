Data on accidents in 2000 (Part 5), also obtained from the NCSHP, were  used to examine whether there were racial disparities in unsafe  driving practices. These data included information about what caused  the accident and the race, sex, and age of the driver. The NCSHP also  supplied data on all officers who worked for the NCSHP in 2000 (Part  6), including their race, age, and rank. The data in Part 6 can be  linked to the data in Parts 3 and 4. In addition, two surveys of North  Carolina drivers were conducted to gather information on reported  typical driving behaviors that may influence the probability of being  stopped, and to gather information about stops conducted by law  enforcement agencies across the state. One was conducted using a  sample of North Carolina drivers who had recently renewed their  licenses (Part 7), and the other used a sample of North Carolina  drivers who were ticketed for speeding between June 1, 1999, and June 1, 2000 (Part 8)."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study investigated whether the North  Carolina State Highway Patrol (NCSHP) practiced racial profiling.

(2) Once stopped, do African Americans  and Whites experience different rates for citations, written warnings,  and searches? (3) What factors might account for highway stops? and  (4) How do African Americans and other ethnic minorities experience  and respond to traffic stops? and (5) Is there any racial disparity in violations of traffic laws?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The project began in 1999 when the North Carolina  State Legislature mandated that the NCSHP assemble data on the racial  distribution of all vehicular stops initiated by officers.

Part 7 contains data from a survey  of 2,920 North Carolina licensed drivers, including 1,445 African  Americans and 1,475 Whites. The survey was administered by the Public  Opinion Laboratory at Northern Illinois University. The survey  collected information on reported typical driving behaviors that may  influence the probability of being stopped. In addition, the survey  asked respondents whether they were stopped in the last year, why they  were stopped, the outcome of the stop, and how they were treated. The  survey was conducted by telephone between June 22, 2000, and March 20,  2001. Part 8 contains data from a survey of 605 North Carolina  residents who were ticketed for speeding between June 1, 1999, and  June 1, 2000. Interviews were conducted by the Public Opinion  Laboratory at Northern Illinois University over telephone between July  2000 and March 2001. One week before the initial telephone contact  attempt, letters were sent to each of the people in the sample.
