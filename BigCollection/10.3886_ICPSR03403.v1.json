Data are  provided on (1) the characteristics of felons sentenced by the  District of Columbia Superior Court (DCSC), (2) the types, lengths,  and variations of sentences imposed, (3) the length of time served in  prison by those committed into the DC Department of Corrections  (DCDOC), and (4) parole release decisions. And the study also  attempted to assess the potential effects of new sentencing practices  implemented in response to the National Capital Revitalization and  Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 and the Truth in Sentencing  Amendment Act of 1998. Data were obtained from several DC criminal  justice agencies, including DC Superior Court, the Pretrial Services  Agency, the DC Department of Corrections, and the DC Parole  Commission. The records of individual defendants were linked across  these databases to the extent possible, and an integrated database on  felony case processing in the District was created in order to use the  unique information from each system to create defendant-level or  person-level records that contained more information about cases than  could be obtained from any one system. The process also involved  linking records within an agency's data system for the purposes of  obtaining the history of contacts with an agency or for the purpose of  aggregating charge-level information into summary data for a docket or  commitment. The final database consists of three files. Part 1 (Felony  Docket Data) includes sentencing information on all felony dockets  sentenced in DCSC between January 1993 and December 1998. Part 2  (Commitments Data) includes sentencing and time served information on  all offenders who were committed to the DCDOC between January 1990 and  December 1998. Part 3 (Decisions Data) includes all decisions made by  the parole board on all types of considerations between January 1993  and December 1998. Part 1 variables provide defendant demographic  characteristics (including age, race, and sex), offense type codes  (for the defendant's most serious offense), type of sentence (prison  only, probation only, split, or fine) and the sentence imposed  (including whether the defendant was sentenced to life). During the  period under study, the District of Columbia followed an indeterminate  sentencing system, and so the data file includes minimum and maximum  periods where applicable (for example, confinement). The data include  information pertaining to the most serious offense at conviction as  well as aggregated sentence information on all felony charges on a  docket (in case there were multiple charges). Part 2 variables in\nclude  dates (of disposition, charging, and release), type of release from  the DCDOC within that time period (including transfer to the Federal  Bureau of Prisons facilities, release on parole, release upon  completion of imposed term, transfer to escape status, and whether the  offender had not yet been released by December 1998), in-prison parole  hearing/decision information (including number of initial hearings,  number of decisions, number of grants, and whether a parole release  decision was granted at the initial hearing while on this commitment),  prior criminal history (including number of prior prison sentences and  the number of prior drug, violent, weapon, and property convictions in  the last 15 years), current commitment sentencing information  (including number of felony, misdemeanor, or split charges, most  serious charge of conviction, and the sentence imposed on the most  serious charge as well as the aggregate sentencing imposed on all  charges of conviction), and the time served by the offender prior to  release (with and without the amount of credit given for jail time  prior to conviction). This file also identifies several problem flags  that need to be taken into account before analyzing the data in order  to select out problem cases (with data entry or computation  errors). Part 3 variables include the date (year, month) of the  hearing, up to four considerations being decided on, up to six  decisions that were made for these considerations, six flags  indicating the types of considerations that were included in the  hearing, and two flags indicating the types of decisions that were included in the current hearing."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"This study collected data on felony sentencing  practices in the District of Columbia during the period 1993 to  1998.

And the study  also attempted to assess the potential effects of new sentencing  practices implemented in response to the National Capital  Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. To begin  implementation of the new law, the Revitalization Act established the  District of Columbia Truth in Sentencing Commission and directed it to  make recommendations to the Council of the District of Columbia for  amendments to the District of Columbia Code with respect to the  sentences to be imposed for felonies committed on or after August 5,  2000. The principal effect of these changes was to convert the  District's sentencing system for all subsection (h) felonies from an  indeterminate system of minimum and maximum prison terms, with parole,  to a determinate system with a single prison term imposed, at least 85  percent of which the defendant would be required to serve. In response  to this mandate, the Council enacted the Advisory Commission on  Sentencing Establishment Act of 1998, establishing the District of  Columbia Advisory Commission on Sentencing (DCACS) and delineating its  role. The DCACS was assigned to conduct a comprehensive study of  criminal sentencing practices in the District of Columbia,  specifically addressing the following matters: (1) the length of  sentences imposed, (2) the length of sentences served, (3) the  proportion of offenders released upon their first parole eligibility  date, and (4) an assessment of the impact on sentence length and  sentencing disparities likely to result from the implementation of DC  Law 12-165, the Truth in Sentencing Amendment Act of 1998. As part of  this effort, the Urban Institute constructed a database of felony case processing in the District during the 1993 to 1998 period."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Urban Institute's (UI) data collection and  analysis were designed in part to assist the DCACS in meeting their  requirements to report on sentencing practices to the District of  Columbia Council. Specifically, the DCACS was required to report on  sentence lengths, time served, and parole releases in a September 30,  1999, report, and to make recommendations about the new sentencing law  in an April 2000 report. Beginning in late February of 1999, the UI  staff met with officials from the D\nC Superior Court (DCSC), the  Pretrial Services Agency (PSA), the DC Department of Corrections  (DCDOC), and the District of Columbia Board of Parole to request and  learn about their data systems. During March, April, and May of 1999,  these agencies submitted extracts of their data. For each agency  except the DCDOC, several extracts were submitted to provide complete  data. Eventually, the DCSC, PSA, and DCDOC provided data extracts  covering defendants in felony cases from 1978 to 1998, and the DC  parole data extract covered parole decisions from about 1990 (when  their electronic database was developed) through 1998. Agency staff  were helpful in explaining their data systems, although written  documentation about the data was relatively sparse. Upon receipt of  source data, UI staff reviewed and analyzed data for completeness. In  some cases, these preliminary reviews resulted in UI requesting  additional or different extracts of data. The UI staff met with the  DCACS several times to address key definitional issues, such as (1)  selecting a most serious offense, (2) offense classification methods,  and (3) measuring time served. The resulting database consists of  three files. Part 1 (Felony Docket Data) includes sentencing  information on all felony dockets sentenced in DCSC between January  1993 and December 1998.

This is because the offender may have been on parole at  the time he/she began a new commitment so that the total time served  in prison may exceed the time the defendant was sentenced to  serve. Similarly, the defendant may have previously been placed on an  escape status and may hence be serving the remainder of an existing  sentence in addition to the currently imposed sanctions. In order to  best approximate these effects, two dummy variables are provided in  the dataset. BACKUP is a dummy variable indicating that the defendant  owed some backup time prior to entering DCDOC on this commitment,  while ESCAPE indicates that the prisoner had escaped prior to this  commitment.
