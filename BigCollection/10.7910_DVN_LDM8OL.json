Rhetorical simplification\r\nremoves in-depth political analysis and argumentation from executive branch\r\ncommunications. Research by Elvin T. Lim (2008) shows that presidential rhetoric that is linguistically simplified is also substantively simplified language. Linguistically and\r\nsubstantively simplified language can be interpreted to mean the political environment is lacking complications or difficulties. Simplified presidential rhetoric has the potential to encourage people to perceive there is no need for an expansion in government\r\ninvolvement in domestic affairs. As an initial attempt to assess this possibility, time series analyses of presidential rhetorical simplicity and public opinion in the United States are performed using quarterly information spanning between 1993 and 2011."}}]},{"typeName":"subject","multiple":true,"typeClass":"controlledVocabulary","value":["Social Sciences"]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential communication, rhetorical simplicity, linguistic simplification, presidential rhetoric, political communication, public opinion, Flesch readability"}}]},{"typeName":"notesText","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Article: \"Empirically contrasting presidential rhetorical simplicity and the public's policy preferences.\" Journal of Communications Research. 6 (1): 1-19."},{"typeName":"depositor","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Olds, Christopher"},{"typeName":"dateOfDeposit","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"2015-08-11"}]}},"files":[{"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses contrasting presidential rhetorical simplicity and public policy mood.","label":"OldsRhetoricalSimplicityPublicPreferencesCommands.txt","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":76212,"dataFile":{"id":2698920,"persistentId":"doi:10.7910/DVN/LDM8OL/QLIG5C","pidURL":"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LDM8OL/QLIG5C","filename":"OldsRhetoricalSimplicityPublicPreferencesCommands.txt","contentType":"text/plain","filesize":19994,"description":"RATS commands used to perform time series analyses contrasting presidential rhetorical simplicity and public policy mood.","storageIdentifier":"s3://dvn-cloud:14f1c5f6007-1d9b087356f9","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"d25b51de86def71c9c872db269c4cf9f","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":"d25b51de86def71c9c872db269c4cf9f"}}},{"description":"Quarterly information on presidential rhetorical simplicity and public opinion about government involvement in domestic affairs.
