The project was meant to serve the needs of policy makers and  the public within an area facing difficult choices over the allocation  of water resources. These data, comprising three separate files, are  taken from information gathered in phone surveys from households in  the Truckee River Watershed, including Truckee, California, and Reno,  Fernley-Wadsworth, and Fallon, Nevada. Part 1, 1998 Data, contains  data from the first wave of interviews in which respondents were asked  whether or not they had a garden, how much grass was in their lawns,  and if they had an automatic watering system. They were also asked  questions about water meters, their water bills, and if they had saved  more water than in the previous year. The survey also contained  questions relating to respondents' environmental opinions, sources of  information on conservation, steps taken to increase water  conservation, and opinions on new innovations. Part 2, 2000 Data,  contains data from the second wave of interviews from a combination of  new respondents and the first wave interviews. The respondents were  asked questions similar to those asked in the first wave of data  collection. Part 3, 1998-2000 Panel Data, contains the data from both  waves of data collection for those respondents who participated in  both interviews. Demographic information includes age, income, sex,  and ZIP code of the respondent, how long the respondent has lived in  the watershed area, the amount of their water bill, the value of their  home, and how much value any landscaping added to the market value of their home."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"conservation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"environmental attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"environmental impact"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"environmental policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"environmental protection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"natural environment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"natural resources"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"water utilities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DATAPASS I.

(3) Value labels were added to many  variables in Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 for clarification and to match  study documentation. (4) Data entry errors in tracezip in Part 2 and  tracezip in Part 3 were recoded per PI instructions. (5) Erroneous  value labels in Part 2 and Part 3 were corrected per PI instructions.  (6) Variables in Part 3 were renamed to make them valid in SAS. (7)  Value labels for -1 in sexr and lscape in Part 2 and lscape_1 and  lscape_2 in Part 3 did not come through in processing. These are  system missing values.
