The special topic modules address such topics as agriculture, education, natural environment and resources, public health, public safety and crime, and science and technology.</p>\n\n<p>This round of Eurobarometer surveys covers the following special topics: (1) helplines for social services, (2) railway competition, (3) food production and quality, and (4) cyber security.  Questions in this survey address the respondent's usage, knowledge, and opinions of telephone hotlines and helplines for services of social value.  Other questions pertain to the respondent's usage and opinions of the current railway system, as well as their opinions about the effects of additional competition in the rail market.  Respondents were asked for their opinions concerning food supply, production, and quality.  Additional questions focused on the respondent's usage of the Internet and their concerns regarding cybercrimes.</p>\n\n<p>Demographic and other background information collected includes age, gender, nationality, marital status and parental relations, occupation, age when stopped full-time education, household composition, ownership of a fixed or mobile telephone and other goods, difficulties in paying bills, level in society, and Internet use.
