The Association of the Bar of the City of  New York and the Drug Abuse Council jointly organized a joint  committee and a research project to collect data, in a systematic  fashion, (1) to ascertain the repercussions of the drug law revision,  (2) to analyze, to the degree possible, why the law was revised, and  (3) to identify any general principles or specific lessons that could  be derived from the New York experience that could be helpful to other  states as they dealt with the problem of illegal drug use and related  crime. This data collection contains five files from the study. Part 1  contains information gathered in a survey investigating the effects of  the 1973 predicate felony provisions on crime committed by repeat  offenders. Data include sex, age at first arrest, county and year of  sampled felony conviction, subsequent arrests up to December 1976,  time between arrests, time incarcerated between arrests, and number  and type of short-span arrests and incarcerations. Part 2 contains  data gathered in a survey meant to estimate the number and proportion  of felony crimes attributable to narcotics users in Manhattan. Case  records for male defendants, aged 16 and older, who were arraigned on  at least one felony charge in Manhattan's Criminal Court, in 1972 and  1975, were sampled. Data include original and reduced charges and  penal code numbers, and indicators of first, second, third, and fourth  drug status. Part 3 contains data gathered in a survey designed to  estimate the number and proportion of felony crimes attributable to  narcotics users in Manhattan. Case records for male defendants, aged  16 and older, who were arraigned on at least one felony charge in  Manhattan's Criminal Court or Manhattan's Supreme Court, were sampled  from 1971 through 1975. Eighty percent of the sample was drawn from  the Criminal Court while the remaining 20 percent was taken from the  Supreme Court. Data include date of arraignment, age, number of  charges, penal code numbers for first six charges, bail information  (e.g., if it was set, amount, and date bail made), disposition and  sentence, indications of first through fourth drug status, first  through third drug of abuse, and treatment status of defendant. Part 4  contains data gathered in a survey that determined the extent of  knowledge of the 1973 drug law among ex-drug users in drug treatment  programs, and to discover any changes in their behavior in response to  the new law. Interviews were administered to non-randomly selected  volunteers from three modalities: residential drug-free, ambulatory  methadone maintenance, and the detoxification unit of the New York  City House of Detention for Men. Data include sources of knowledge of  drug laws (e.g., from media, subway posters, police, friends, dealers,  and treatment programs), average length of sentence for various drug  convictions, maximum sentence for such crimes, the pre-1974 sentence  for such crimes, type of plea bargaining done, and respondent's  opinion of the effects of the new law on police activity, the street,  conviction rates,\nand drug use. Part 5 contains data from a survey  that estimated the number and proportion of felony crimes attributable  to narcotics users in Manhattan. Detained males aged 16 and older in  Manhattan pre-trial detention centers who faced at least one current  felony charge were sampled. Data include date of admission and  discharge, drug status and charges, penal code numbers for first  through sixth charge, bail information, and drug status and treatment."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"convictions (law)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"courts"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime control"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crime prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal justice system"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug law offenses"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug laws"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug law enforcement"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug related crimes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"drug use"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"evaluation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legislation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legislative impact"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sentencing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"New York (state)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"New York City"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"United States"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

One  consisted of randomly selected days between October 1970 and  September, 1971. The other sample consisted of randomly selected days  between October 1972 and September 1973. For each selected day, all  cases in which a person had been convicted of a non-drug felony and given  a non-incarceration sentence were selected. All information about the  offender was noted. This information was then given to the New York  State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DJCS). The DJCS traced  the criminal histories of each offender through December 1976. Only  cases in which \"rap sheets\" (criminal histories) were found were  used. Part 2: Two small samples of approximately 225 cases in each of  two time periods, one pre-law (January 1972 through June 1973), and one  post-law (July 1974 through December 1975), were drawn to determine the  user/non-user composition of this group of felony charges which were  reduced or dismissed at first arraignment. In addition, two samples of  approximately 240 cases each were randomly selected from the  population of felony cases entering criminal court arraignment.  Two  time periods were sampled: one a pre-law period, January 1972-June  1973, and the second a post-law period, July 1974-December 1975.  The  results from the two samples made it possible to derive the overall  rates at which felonies are reduced to misdemeanors or dismissed at  criminal court arraignment. Part 3: In order to correct the charge  distribution by user status from the pre-trial detention population, a  sample of cases was gathered in the Supreme and Criminal Courts of  Manhattan from all cases showing up in detention flow. In order to  match the cases from detention, only felony cases surviving  arraignment were selected. The sample was divided between Supreme  Court cases and criminal court felony cases surviving  arraignment. Since 20 percent of all felony arrests result in  indictment, the sample was stratified: 20 percent Supreme Court and 80  percent Criminal Court. In two 15-month time periods, one pre-law  period (January 1972-March 1973), and one post-law period (October  1974-December 1975), 901 cases were sampled. Part 4: For the study,  45-minute interviews were conducted with a non-random selection of 291  volunteers among clients in drug treatment programs in New York  City. Three modalities of treatment are represented: residential  drug-free, ambulatory methadone maintenance, and the detoxification  unit of the New York City House of Detention for Men. Part 5: The  sample was limited to Manhattan, and restricted to the male detention  population, the contention being that males commit a majority of the  felonies. A random sample was taken of over 500 felony cases per year for  the years 1971-1975 from the Department of Corrections records kept on  all defendants\ndetained. The sample was stratified as follows:  adolescent males constituted 20 percent of the sample, and adult males  80 percent. In sampling the prison records, misdemeanor cases and  records of sentenced prisoners transferred to the detention facilities  for work assignments were excluded. All records of persons detained on  felony charges were included in the sample, including the group of prisoners who spent only a few hours in detention."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Charge Reduction Study File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":33715,"dataFile":{"id":2600882,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Charge Reduction Study File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Criminal Court File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":33715,"dataFile":{"id":2600883,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Criminal Court File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Ex-Drug Users File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":33715,"dataFile":{"id":2600884,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Ex-Drug Users File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Predicate Felony File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":33715,"dataFile":{"id":2600881,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Predicate Felony File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Prison Detoxification Study File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":33715,"dataFile":{"id":2600885,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Prison Detoxification Study File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
