This data collection was undertaken to assess public opinion  prior to President Bill Clinton's second-term inauguration as  president of the United States. Respondents were asked to give their  opinions of President Clinton and his handling of the first term of  his presidency, whether he would do a better or worse job in his  second term in office, whether they approved of his choices for  Cabinet and other top positions in his administration, and what the  nature of his relationship with Congress should be in his second  term. Views were sought on whether President Clinton had made progress  toward reducing unemployment and improving education during his first  term, and whether he would make substantial progress in these areas  during his second term. Respondents rated the most important issue  facing the country, whether they were better or worse off financially  compared to four years ago, whether they approved of the way Congress  was handling its job, whether they expected Congress to do a better  job in the next two years, and whether they trusted the Clinton  administration or the Republicans in Congress to handle the main  problems the nation would face over the next few years. Other  questions asked whether respondents approved of the way Hillary  Clinton was handling her job as first lady and the amount of influence\nshe held over her husband, and whether she should play a greater role  in her husband's second administration. A series of questions asked  about recent allegations involving President Clinton, including  Whitewater, the Democratic National Campaign Committee's acceptance of  foreign contributions, and former Arkansas state employee Paula  Jones's sexual harassment charges, and whether they would interfere  with his ability to serve as president. Additional topics addressed  what actions the government should take to protect the long-term  financial stability of Social Security and the Medicare health system  and the overall level of ethics and honesty in politics and the  federal government. Demographic variables include sex, age, race,  education level, household income, political party affiliation, political philosophy, and voter participation
