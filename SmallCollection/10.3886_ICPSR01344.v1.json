Because  of this and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) long-standing  commitment to price stability, the author argues that the FOMC has an  implicit long-run inflation objective (LIO) lower and upper bounds to  the long-run inflation rate. He shows that the statements made by the  FOMC in 2003 clarified the lower bound of its LIO and that the average  of long-run inflation expectations responded by rising about 80 basis  points. Moreover, consistent with reducing the market's uncertainty  about the FOMC's LIO, long-run inflation expectations became more  stable. The FOMC has recently been more specific about the upper bound  of its LIO as\nwell. The FOMC could eliminate the remaining uncertainty by establishing an explicit, numerical inflation objective."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"inflation rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"price fluctuations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"price trends"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
