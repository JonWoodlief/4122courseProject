This paper shows how such estimates might benefit from closer  attention to regional developments. Regional business cycles do not  move in lock-step, and greater dispersion among regions can affect  estimates of the natural rate of unemployment. There is microeconomic  evidence that employers are more reluctant to cut wages than they are  to raise them. Accordingly, the relationship between wage inflation  and vacancies is convex: An increase in vacancies raises wage  inflation at an increasing rate. The authors' empirical results are  consistent with this and indicate that if all else had remained  constant, the reduction in the dispersion of regional unemploymen\nt  rates between 1982 and 2000 would have meant a two-percentage-point drop in the natural rate of aggregate unemployment."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"business cycles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"unemployment rate"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
