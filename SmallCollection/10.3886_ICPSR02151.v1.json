The  National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects racial/ethnic  enrollment data from higher education institutions on an annual  basis. Some institutions do not report these data, and their  \"unknown\" categories have previously been distributed in direct  proportion to the \"knowns.\" This resulted in lower than accurate  figures for the racial/ethnic categories. With the advent of the  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), NCES has  attempted to eliminate this problem by distributing all \"race/ethnicity  unknown\" students through a two-stage process. First, the differences  between reported totals and racial/ethnic details were allocated on a  gender and institutional basis by distributing the differences in  direct proportion to reported distributions. The second-stage  distribution was designed to eliminate the remaining instances of  \"race/ethnicity unknown\". The procedure was to accumulate the  reported racial/ethnic total enrollments by state, level, control, and  gender, calculate the percentage distributions, and apply these  percentages to the reported total enrollments of institutional  respondents (in the same state, level, and control) that did not  supply race/ethnicity detail. In addition, the original \"race/ethnicity  unknown\" data were also left unaltered for those who wish to review the  numbers actually distributed. The racial/ethnic status was broken down  into nonresident alien, Black non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan  Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and White non-Hispanic.  There are five data files. Part 1, Institutional Characteristics, includes  variables on control and level of institution, religious affiliation,  highest level of offering, Carnegie classification, and state FIPS code  and abbreviation. Variables in Part 2, Reported Enrollment Data by  Race/Ethnicity, cover total original enrollment data by race/ethnicity  and sex and by level and year of study of student. Race/ethnicity data  were not imputed for institutions that only reported total enrollment.  Part 3, Adjusted Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity, includes summary enrollment  data by adjusted race/ethnicity and sex of student and by level and year  of study of student. The \"race/ethnicity unknown\" category data were  distributed across all known race categories in this file. Also, race   data were imputed for institutions that did not report enrollment by race.  Part 4, Enrollment Data by Age Categories and by Level and Sex of  Student, includes enrollment data by age categories and by level and sex  of student. Part 5, Clarifying Questions on Enrollments, provides  information on students enrolled in remedial courses, extension divisions,  and branches of schools, and numbers of transfer students from in-state, out of state, and other countries."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"community colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ethnicity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"gender"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"race"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school enrollments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.
