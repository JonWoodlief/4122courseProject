Day fines are a structured approach to imposing  fines that considers both the offender's ability to pay and the  severity of the offense. The program involves two steps: (1) a  determination of the number of fine units for an offense, based on the  severity of the offense, and (2) a valuation of fine units, based on  the offender's net daily income, hence the name \"day fines\". While  four jurisdictions participated in the day fines evaluation, only the  site in Maricopa County, Arizona, was structured in such a way to  allow for a quasi-experimental research design. Therefore, this  collection only contains data from the Financial Assessment Related to  Employability (FARE) day fines program in Maricopa County. The FARE  program was started in 1991 and targeted felony offenders with little  need for supervision or treatment -- in other words, the low risk-low  need defendant. The intent of the program was to draw clients from the  population of offenders who would traditionally receive routine  probation, thus serving as an intermediate sanction between routine  and summary probation. The major research strategy was to consider the  FARE-sentenced offenders as the experimental group and to construct a  similar comparison group out of the offenders sentenced by non-day  fines judges. The design involved three major steps: (1)  identification of 1991 and 1992 defendants who received a FARE  sentence, (2) screening of sentenced defendants in non-FARE courts  using FARE eligibility criteria to match the FARE participants, and  (3) coding background and 12-month follow-up information for both FARE  and comparison group offenders from probation and clerk files to  record background information, monetary payments, and any technical  violations and arrests occurring during the 12-month follow-up  period. Variables in Part 1, Fines Paid Data, include the total amount  of the fine and how much of the fine was applied to probation fees,  reimbursement, restitution, and victim compensation.

(2) How  many eligible offenders received the day fines specified in the  program's design? (3) What revenues were collected from the day fines  programs? (4) Is there evidence that the imposition of day fines is associated with an increase or decrease in recidivism?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"While four jurisdictions participated in the day  fines evaluation, only the site in Maricopa County, Arizona, was  structured in such a way to allow for a quasi-experimental research  design.

The FARE program was initially started in 1991 and  targeted felony offenders with little need for supervision or  treatment -- in other words, the low risk-low need defendant. The  intent of the program was to draw clients from the population of  offenders who would traditionally receive routine probation, thus  serving as an intermediate sanction between routine and summary  probation. The Maricopa FARE program used day fines to structure the  total amount of a monetary sanction, which might include a fine,  probation service fee, victim compensation fund, and restitution. The  program planners assigned 250 penal codes to 14 severity levels. Using  a range of 350 penalty units, with 10 being the minimum, severity  levels were assigned ranges of units, and then each individual offense  was assigned a penalty unit within that range. Next the unit value was  assigned based on the offender's net daily income, which had been  determined from the information supplied by the defendant during the  presentence investigation. The amount was then discounted for the  number of dependents, up to eight, and also for incomes that fell  under the national poverty level. Day fine collection activities  focused on a system of notification and graduated sanctions for  noncompliance, with jail as a last resort. The evaluation of the day  fines program was facilitated by the way court cases are assigned in  Maricopa County. The county is divided into four major judicial  quadrants. Within each quadrant, two judges were selected to  participate in the FARE program, while the remaining judges did  not. All cases were randomly assigned to the judges. This structure  laid the framework for an evaluation in which comparable offenders in  each of the four quadrants could be studied as comparison group  offenders. The major research strategy was to consider the  FARE-sentenced offenders as the experimental group and to construct a  similar comparison group out of the offenders sentenced by non-day  fines judges.
