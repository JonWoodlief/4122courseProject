LeBaron (1996) and Szakmary and Mathur (1997) show that  extrapolative technical trading rules trade against United States  foreign exchange intervention and produce excess returns during  intervention periods. Leahy (1995) shows that United States  intervention itself is profitable over long periods of time. In other  words, technical traders make excess returns when they take positions  contrary to United States intervention. United States intervention itself is profitable, however."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"foreign exchange"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
