A consensus has arisen among economists that the acceleration  was caused by technological innovations that decreased the  quality-adjusted prices of semiconductors and related information and  communications technology (ICT) products, including digital  computers. In sharp contrast to the previous 20 years,  services-producing sectors heavy users of ICT products-led the  productivity increase, besting even a robust manufacturing sector. In  this article, the authors survey the performance of the  services-producing and goods-producing sectors and examine revisions  to\naggregate labor productivity data of the type commonly discussed by  policymakers. The revisions, at times, were large enough to reverse  preliminary conclusions regarding productivity growth slowdowns and  accelerations. The anticipated acceleration in the services sector and  the large size of revisions to aggregate data combine to shed light on why economists were slow to recognize the productivity acceleration."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"communications systems"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"labor productivity"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"technological change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
