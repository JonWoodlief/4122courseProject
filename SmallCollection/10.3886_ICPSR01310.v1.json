One empirical  question about the federal funds rate concerns the extent to which  monetary policymakers smooth this interest rate. Under the hypothesis  of rate smoothing, policymakers set the interest rate this period  equal to a weighted average of the rate inherited from the previous  quarter and the rate implied by current economic conditions, such as  the Taylor rule rate. Perhaps surprisingly, however, little attention  has been given to measuring the interest rate inherited from the  previous quarter. Previous tests for interest rate smoothing have  assumed that the quarterly or monthly average from the\nprevious period  is the inherited rate. The authors of this study, in contrast, suggest  that the end-of-quarter level of the target federal funds rate is the  inherited rate, and empirical tests support this proposition. The  authors show that this alternative view of the rate inherited from the  past affects empirical results concerning interest rate smoothing, even in relatively rich models that include regime switching."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"interest rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"monetary policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
