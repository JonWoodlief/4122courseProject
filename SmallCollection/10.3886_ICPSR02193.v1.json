To that end, the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances was designed to gather household-level information closely comparable to that obtained in the SURVEY OF CONSUMER FINANCES, 1992 (ICPSR 6729). Detailed data were collected on the composition of household budgets, the terms of loans, and relationships with financial institutions. Information was also obtained on the employment history and pension rights of the survey respondent and the spouse or partner of the respondent. Detailed dat\na were also gathered on characteristics of the survey respondent's housing and vehicle(s). In addition to recording data on the economic. assets and liabilities of families, the survey examined the attitudes of consumers toward credit use, and their reactions to consumer credit regulations and lines of credit. Demographic variables include age, sex, marital status, housing, and financial independence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"consumer protection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"credit"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"debt"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"durable goods"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial assets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial institutions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"household budgets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"job history"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"loans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"pension plans"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vehicles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"DSDR IX.

Because the SCF are  unable to give users any sample information about cases in the  dataset, users will be unable on their own to compute reasonable  estimates of the sampling variances of their estimates. To facilitate  such estimation, two files of replicate weights and multiplicity  factors are provided. The weight X42001 (Part 3) is a partially  design-based weight constructed at the Federal Reserve using original  selection probabilities and frame information along with aggregate  control totals estimated from the Current Population Survey. This  weight is a relatively minor revision of the consistent weight series  X42000 (Part 2) maintained for the SCFs beginning with 1989. (For a  detailed discussion of these weights, see Arthur B. Kennickell and  R. Louise Woodburn, \"Consistent Weight Design for the 1989, 1992, and  1995 SCFs, and the Distribution of Wealth,\" REVIEW OF INCOME AND  WEALTH 45,2 (June 1999), 193-215, or the longer version given on the  SCF Web site:   http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html\n<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html\">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/method.html</a>\n). The nature  of the revisions to the consistent weights is described in Arthur  Kennickell, \"Revisions to the SCF Weighting Methodology: Accounting  for Race/Ethnicity and Homeownership\" (January 1999) (see the SCF Web  site). Users should be aware that the sum of each of the weights over  all sample cases and imputation replicates is equal to five times the number of households in the sample universe."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Main Data File","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37677,"dataFile":{"id":2628877,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Main Data File","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Replicate Weight File -- X42000","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37677,"dataFile":{"id":2628878,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Replicate Weight File -- X42000","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Replicate Weight File -- X42001","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":37677,"dataFile":{"id":2628879,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Replicate Weight File -- X42001","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
