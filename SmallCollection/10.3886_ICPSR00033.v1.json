The data files were prepared for   instructional use in the ICPSR Training Program and for graduate-level   social science courses at the University of Michigan and other   university campuses. They contain social, demographic, electoral,   and economic data for various areas of the United\nStates, usually   for an extended period of time. Part 1, Ohio Referenda Counties as   Units, and Part 2, Ohio Referenda as Units, consist of county-level   returns for 42 referenda in the 1912 general election in Ohio. Data are   provided for the names of counties, votes in the affirmative, total   number of votes, and percentage of the \"yes\" votes for referenda on   issues such as civil juries, capital punishment, governor's veto,   workmen's compensation, 8-hour day, removal of elected officials, prison   labor, women's suffrage, and taxes. The referenda included many questions   considered important in the Progressive Movement. Part 3, Data Sets for   Three States (Michigan, Nebraska, and New York), consists of electoral   returns for the offices of president, governor, and United States   representative, as well as ecological and population characteristics data   in the period 1920-1940. Data are provided for the raw votes and percentage   of the total votes received by the Democratic, Republican, Progressive, and   other parties. Items also provide information on population characteristics,  such as the total number of population, voting age population, urban   population, and persons of other races, and school attendance and religion.   Economic variables provide information on local government expenditures and   revenues, agriculture and manufacturing, employment and unemployment, and  the total number of banks and bank deposits."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"election returns"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"instruction"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"instructional materials"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"referendum"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"vote count"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR X.A.3.
