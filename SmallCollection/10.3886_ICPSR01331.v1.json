We re-examine the measurement data on these American beauty icons  and show that these reports are false in several ways. First, the  variation in waist-to-hip ratios among these women is greater than  reported. Second, the center of the distribution of waist-to-hip  ratios is not 0.70, but less than this. Third, the average  waist-to-hip ratio within both samples has changed over time in a  manner that is statistically significant and can\nbe regarded as  mutually consistent. Taken together, the findings undermine some of  the evidence given for the repeated suggestion that there is something  special--evolutionarily hard-wired or otherwise--about a specific  female waist-to-hip ratio of 0.70 as a preference of American heterosexual males."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"body image"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"physical appearance"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
