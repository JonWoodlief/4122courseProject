The authors use shift-share analysis to  account for the difference between a state's manufacturing export  growth and national manufacturing export growth between 1988 and  1998. Three effects are examined. The industry mix effect indicates  that a state should have experienced export growth above the national  average if its exports were relatively more concentrated in industries  whose exports expanded faster than the national average. The  destination effect indicates that a state should have experienced  export growth above the national average if its exports were  concentra\nted in foreign markets whose purchases from the United States  expanded faster than the national increase in exports. The competitive  effect is what remains after accounting for these two effects. The  authors find that the competitive effect, which in previous research  was related to increases in human capital per worker, is the key  determinant of a state's relative export performance. Furthermore, the  industry mix and destination effects, which are of similar importance,  are generally dominated by the competitive effect in accounting for a state's relative export performance."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic growth"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"exports"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"manufacturing industry"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"states (USA)"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
