In May 1999, the FOMC began to  announce publicly the symmetry of its current directive. This resulted  in much speculation about the meaning of asymmetric directives, which  the FOMC had never officially defined. In this article, the authors.  investigate three suggested interpretations: (1) Asymmetry was  intended to convey likely changes in policy either between FOMC  meetings or at the next meeting, (2) Asymmetry increased the  chairman's authority to change policy in the direction indicated by  the specified asymmetry, and (3) Asymmetric language was used  primarily to build consensus among voting FOMC members. The authors  find strong support in the implementation of monetary policy only for the consensus\n-building hypothesis."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Federal Open Market Committee"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policy making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
