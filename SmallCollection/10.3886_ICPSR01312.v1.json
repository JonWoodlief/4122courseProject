These enterprises engage in two separate and  distinct lines of business: (1) assembling and marketing pools of  mortgages on which they guarantee the timely payments of principal and  interest and (2) purchasing mortgage assets for their own portfolio,  mostly funded with debt securities. This article examines the  sensitivity of the returns on GSEs' shares to realizations of interest  rate risk. The study shows that the market value of Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac's equity is vulnerable to increases in short-term interest  rates and changes in the term spread (the difference between the long-term and short-term interest rates)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"interest rates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"mortgages"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
