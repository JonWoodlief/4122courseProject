This organizing  principle recently became the focus of national attention when the  Supreme Court and the U.S. Congress took opposite sides in a  controversy regarding the number of common bonds (fields of  membership) that could coexist within a single credit union. In this  article, a model of credit union formation and consolidation is  developed and simulated to examine the effects of common-bond  restrictions on the performance of credit unions. The performance  measures are based on participation rates among potential members and  the operating costs of credit unions. Using a semiparametric  econometric model and a large dataset drawn from federally-chartered  occupational credit unions in 1996, the authors find that, for a given  number of potential members, credit unions with multiple-group  charters have\nhigher participation rates. They also find that, for a  given number of members, the operating costs of multiple-group credit  unions are higher. Average operating costs at large credit unions,  however, decrease as the number of members increases. The authors also  find that local deposit-market concentration is related to participation rates and operating costs of credit unions."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"credit unions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"econometrics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"monetary policy"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
