Recent reductions in reserve  requirements have not been accompanied by significant reductions in  vault cash. This situation suggests that banks may be managing vault  cash reserves primarily as precautionary balances to satisfy daily  fluctuations in deposits and withdrawals, rather than as part of total  reserve management. In 1997, some larger banks instituted formal  management of vault currency. If this practice spreads, it will have implications for monetary policy and cash operations."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"banks"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial management"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
