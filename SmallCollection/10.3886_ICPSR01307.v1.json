This paper focuses on the changing  geography of merchandise exports from individual U.S. states to  foreign countries. Generally speaking, the geographic distribution of  state exports has changed so that trade has become more intense with  nearby countries relative to distant countries. All states, however,  did not experience similar changes. As measured by the distance of  trade, which is the average distance that a state's international  trade is transported, 40 states experienced a declining distance of  trade, while 11 states (including Washington, DC) experienced an  increasing distance of trade. Evidence, albeit far from definitive,  suggests that declining transportation costs over land, the  implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and faster  income growth by nearby tradin\ng partners relative to distant partners have contributed to the changing geography of state exports."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"exports"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"international trade"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
