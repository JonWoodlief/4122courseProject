Respondents were asked if the  Swiss federal system and the Swiss direct democracy system should be  considered as models for other countries. Respondents were also asked  whether Switzerland was a good example of a multicultural society,  whether it was a conservative country in urgent need of reforms,  whether it participated enough in efforts aimed at solving economic,  social, and political problems, and whether it had a strong tradition  of humanitarian aid. Opinions were sought on Swiss banking practices,  including the role of the Swiss in business, accountability for  foreign investors, and repayment to World War II victims. A series of  questions pertaining to minority groups of different races, religions,  and cultures was asked. Items included perceptions of the presence or  number of minorities in the country, workplace, and neighborhood of  the respondent, as well as the impact of such groups on societal  values, the economy, job markets, education, Social Security, and  sports. Also probed were respondents' views on rights for legal and  illegal immigrants (noncitizens), including freedom of speech,  housing, education, protection against discrimination, and  circumstances for deportation. A few questions covered the \"European  Year against Racism\" (1997) campaign and the role European  institutions play or should adopt in the fight against  racism. Respondents were also asked to rate their own degree of racism  and to name groups they or their country found disturbing. If a group  was named, respondents were asked if they could imagine having a close  relationship with or working for someone from this group, and if it  would be difficult to accept their child marrying into this group and  having children with someone from this group. Information was also  gathered on education and training throughout life. Respondents  indicated reasons for or against lifelong training, the necessity of  such training in light of evolving information and\ncommunication  technologies, the impact of continuing training on their own private  and work lives, and preferred types of training courses. Other queries  concerned family planning and work situations. Respondents listed the  number of children they had and indicated whether they were working  part-time, full-time, or not at all. In addition, respondents  specified the age at which women should have their first child and  their last child, and commented on the ideal work situation while  rearing children. Respondents also described preferred arrangements  for taking care of elderly parents, including who should be  responsible for payment. Demographic and other background information  provided includes respondent's age, sex, marital status, and  left-right political self-placement as well as household income, the number of people residing in the home, and region of residence."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"continuing education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"crosscultural perceptions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cultural pluralism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"employment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"family planning"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"immigration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"information technology"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"lifelong education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"racial attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"racism"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"work"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
