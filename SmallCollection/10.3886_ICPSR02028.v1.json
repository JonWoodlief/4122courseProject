Using an  experimental design, researchers sought to measure the extent of  change in attitudes and behaviors due to the cognitive skills program  by administering pre- and post-test interviews. Researchers also  measured recidivism by conducting interviews with probation officers  who supervised the offenders in the sample six months after  termination from intensive supervision. These interviews were  supplemented with administrative records data that provided background  information about the sample. In addition, administrative data were  collected on all juveniles sentenced to intensive supervision during  fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to compare juveniles in the sample with all  juveniles in the intensive program. Variables in this collection  include cognitive measures, such as impulsivity, problem-solving  ability, egocentricity, and cognitive style. Other variables measure  emotional responses to various situations, attitudes toward the law,  values, drug abuse, program participation, and  recidivism. Administrative data include age, gender, ethnicity, offense of conviction, and basic assessment data."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"The Reasoning and Rehabilitation Cognitive Skills  Development Program was developed by Ross and Fabiano in 1985 as an  educational program that focused on teaching the following cognitive  skills to offenders: problem-solving, consequential thinking,  means-end reasoning, social perspective-taking, critical reasoning,  abstract reasoning, creative thinking, and values. In 1992 the  Colorado Office of Probation Services incorporated the Reasoning and  Rehabilitation Program as a requirement for young offenders placed in  juvenile intensive supervision probation. While previous research had  evaluated this cognitive skills program for adults, this project was  designed to evaluate the outcomes of this program as implemented in a  juvenile setting. In particular, it sought to answer the following  questions: (1) Did the program work to change attitudes, thinking  patterns, and behaviors? (2) Did the program have an impact on  post-termination rates of recidivism? and (3) For which types of offenders did the program work best?"}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"To evaluate how well the Reasoning and  Rehabilitation program worked in juvenile intensive supervision  probation in Colorado, the researchers developed an experimental  design whereby clients were randomly assigned to participate or not  participate in the cognitive program. To measure the extent of change  in attitudes and behaviors due to the program, clients in both the  treatment and control groups were administered pre- and post-test  interviews based on two instruments. The first was a slightly modified  versi\non of a semi-structured interview developed by the authors of the  program as part of a larger cognitive skills assessment battery. The  second instrument was a self-administered 70-item battery of  statements measuring concepts related to crime and criminal attitudes  that respondents were asked to rank on a Likert-scale format. These  measures were designed to assess the extent of change in cognitive  skills and functioning among the sample in nine areas: (1) ability to  recognize that problems exist, (2) ability to solve interpersonal  problems, (3) ability to think of and develop alternatives, (4)  awareness of consequences, (5) ability to set and achieve goals, (6)  level of egocentricity, (7) social perspective-taking, (8) level of  impulsivity, and (9) cognitive style. To measure recidivism rates of  juveniles in the sample, researchers conducted interviews with  probation officers who supervised the offenders in the sample six  months after termination from intensive probation. Recidivism was  measured by rearrest for a new crime. These interviews were  supplemented with administrative records data that provided background  information about the sample. In addition, administrative data were  collected on all juveniles sentenced to intensive supervision during  fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to compare juveniles in the sample with all juveniles on probation."}},{"dsDescriptionValue":{"typeName":"dsDescriptionValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"In Part 1, Pre- and Post-Test Data, variables  include cognitive measures such as impulsivity, problem-solving  ability, egocentricity, and cognitive style.
