Credit union managers administer this transfer of benefits,  but their performance is difficult to measure, particularly in larger  credit unions. In this article, the authors develop a model of  efficiency wages and optimal risk-taking and then provide empirical  evidence from a large sample of occupational credit unions. Higher  wage expenses are found in larger credit unions. In addition, the  authors find a negative relationship between credit union size and  risk-taking. They also find that local deposit-market concentration is  a significant factor in explaining wage costs and risk-taking in occupational credit unions."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"credit unions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"risk assessment"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"wages and salaries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
