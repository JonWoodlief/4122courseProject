The authors of this article  find that the effect of professionalization on incumbent electoral  success is far more pervasive. As the level of professionalism of a  legislature increases, members' relationships with the legislature's  environment change: the effects of external political and economic  forces (such as coattails from higher-level elections and national  economic conditions) on a legislator's chances for reelection diminish  in strength. This implies that legislative professionalization  promotes institutionalization b\ny establishing boundaries that insulate  members from external shocks. The authors reach these conclusions by  specifying and testing a district-level model of state legislative  election outcomes having the probability that an incumbent will win  reelection as a dependent variable. The model is estimated with probit using data for over 42,000 state legislators from 1970 to 1989."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"legislators"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"reelection"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
