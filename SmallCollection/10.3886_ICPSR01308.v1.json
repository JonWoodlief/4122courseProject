The authors identify several  episodes of sustained rapid rises in equity prices in the 19th and  20th centuries, and then assess the growth of real output,  productivity, the price level, and money and credit stocks during each  episode. Two booms stand out in terms of their length and rate of  increase in market prices -- the booms of 1923-1929 and 1994-2000. In  general, the authors find that booms occurred in periods of rapid real  growth and productivity advancement, suggesting that booms are driven  at least partly by fundamentals. The\ny find no consistent relationship  between inflation and stock market booms, though booms have typically occurred when money and credit growth were above average."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"stock market conditions"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"stock markets"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
