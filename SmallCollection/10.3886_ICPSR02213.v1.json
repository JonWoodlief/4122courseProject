IPEDS collects information on such  topics as institutional characteristics, enrollments, completions,  finance, staff, and libraries. All schools in the IPEDS universe were  asked to complete an institutional characteristics form. Approximately  3,600 institutions of higher education (i.e., those that are  accredited at the college level by an agency recognized by the  Secretary, United States Department of Education) plus another 400  nonaccredited schools that grant a bachelor's, master's, doctoral, or  first-professional degree were asked to complete the full complement  of IPEDS surveys. Of the remaining 6,500 postsecondary schools who  were eligible to receive the Consolidated (CN) survey form, 2,998  schools were sent the form, of which 2,472 responded. The following  data were requested from institutions using the CN survey form: (1)  fall enrollment for 1990, by racial/ethnic category and sex of  student, (2) completions for the 1989-1990 academic year, by field of  study and award level and by racial/ethnic category and sex of  recipient, (3) financial statistics for fiscal year 1990, including  revenue/tuition fees, expenditures/scholarship, and other  expenditures, and (4) selected data on libraries on total FTE staff,  operating expenses, and total circulation transactions. The single CN  form was substituted for the four more detailed IPEDS surveys that  were sent to the accredited/degree-granting institutions. Data for the  CN respondent institutions appear on both the CN file and on the  individual IPEDS adapt files for the fall enrollment, completions, finance, and libraries surveys."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"colleges"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"educational populations"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"financial management"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"graduates"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"higher education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"libraries"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"postsecondary education"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"school enrollments"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"universities"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR V.A.

Information collected from these institutions is less detailed than  information collected from other IPEDS respondents. The collection  contains data for 91 four-year institutions, 1,046 two-year schools,  and 1,335 less-than-two-year institutions.

Each school is  represented multiple times in the file depending upon how many parts  they completed (A-D) and the types of student information they  provided (e.g., separate records for full and part-time).
