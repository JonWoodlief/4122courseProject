The SAP was a two-part  nationally representative survey consisting of a records check based  on probation office administrative records and personal interviews  with probationers. The records check provided detailed information  for 5,867 probationers on current offenses and sentences, criminal  histories, levels of supervision and contacts, disciplinary hearings  and outcomes, and demographic characteristics. Only adults with a  formal sentence to probation who were not considered absconders were  included in the records check. Excluded were persons supervised by a  federal probation agency, those only on parole, persons on presentence  or pretrial diversion, juveniles, and absconders. The records check  forms were completed by a probation officer or by another person  knowledgeable about probation office records. A subset of the  population selected for the records check was selected for a personal  interview, resulting in a total of 2,030 completed interviews. The  personal interview sample excluded from the records check sample  probationers not on active probation (defined as being required to  make office visits at any interval), those incarcerated, and those in  residential treatment. Respondents were asked about current  offense(s) and supervision, criminal history, alcohol and drug use and  treatment, mental health treatment, demographic characteristics, and a  variety of socioeconomic characteristics such as employment, income,  receipt of welfare, housing, number of children and child support, and living conditions while growing up."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"arrest records"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"criminal histories"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"demographic characteristics"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"offender profiles"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probation"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"probationers"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"sentencing"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"supervised liberty"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVII.E.

The sample design was a  stratified two-stage selection. In the first stage, probation  agencies were stratified into 16 strata defined by government branch  (executive or judicial) and level (state or local), and census region  (Northeast, Midwest, South, or West). The 43 largest probation  agencies were made self-representing and were selected into the sample  with certainty.\nThe remaining 2,584 probation agencies were not  self-representing and were grouped within strata into 122 roughly  equal-size clusters. One agency was selected from each of the 122  clusters, with probability of selection proportional to size, for a  total of 165 agencies. From the records check sample, 4,703  probationers were selected for personal interviews, which made up the  second survey component. Because probationers on inactive supervision  were excluded from the personal interview sample, the personal  interview component represents a somewhat smaller share of the  nation's probationers (2,065,896) than the records check (2,620,560).  For the personal interview sample, 122 of the 206 agencies originally  selected for the records check were chosen. The 43 largest  self-representing agencies were selected with certainty. Of the 122  clusters of agencies that were not self-representing, 79 were  selected, using a systematic sample. Excluding agencies in the sample  that would only participate in the records checks resulted in a total of 101 probation offices in which interviews were conducted."},{"typeName":"cleaningOperations","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"Standardized missing values."}]}},"files":[{"description":"","label":"Personal Interview Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":34222,"dataFile":{"id":2604163,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Personal Interview Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}},{"description":"","label":"Records Check Data","restricted":false,"version":1,"datasetVersionId":34222,"dataFile":{"id":2604162,"persistentId":"","pidURL":"","filename":"Records Check Data","contentType":"data/various-formats","filesize":0,"description":"","storageIdentifier":"","rootDataFileId":-1,"md5":"","checksum":{"type":"MD5","value":""}}}]}}}
