Using a new solution to the ecological inference problem  developed by Gary King, the investigators used these data to estimate  the proportion of voters splitting their ballots in each electoral  unit. The variation in ticket-splitting across electoral units was  then examined. The investigators found that, contrary to balancing  arguments, voters were not intentionally splitting their tickets to  produce divided government and moderate policies. In most cases split  outcomes were a byproduct of lopsided congressional campaigns that  featured well-funded, high-quality candidates versus unknown competitors, and split-ticket voting was largely unintentional."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"congressional elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"presidential elections"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"voting behavior"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
