The authors  examine inflation-output variability tradeoffs implied by optimal  inflation and price-level rules. In previous work with the  Neoclassical Phillips Curve, the authors found that the choice between  inflation targeting and price-level targeting depended on the amount  of persistence in the output gap. That is, if the output gap was not  too persistent, or if lagged output did not enter the aggregate supply  function, then inflation targets were preferred to price-level  targets. When one starts with a New-Keynesian Phillips Curve, the  amount of persistence in the output gap still affects the relative  placement of the inflation-output variability tradeoff. But, contrary  to the Neoclassical case, even where the persistence of the output gap  in the aggregate supply function is small or nonexistent, the  price-level targeting regime still results in a more favorable  tradeoff between output and inflation variabi\nlity than does an inflation-targeting regime."}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XVIII.
