Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and opinions on the European Union (EU), including what sources of information about the EU they used and whether their country had benefited from being an EU member. This study also focused on women and cancer, the role of the European Parliament, and expectations of the EU. All female respondents were asked if they thought they could ever have breast or cervical cancer, and if they knew anybody who currently had cancer, had had it, or had died from it. Female respondents also indicated the types of examinations they had had, their confidence in preventive examinations including whether or not cancer prevention is possible, and whether they thought manual breast examinations, mammographies, gynecological examinations, and cervical smear tests could detect cancer. Female respondents also commented on their knowledge of national screening programs, their willingness to participate in such programs, and which aspects of cancer they would like to be better informed about. Items concerning the European Parliament asked all respondents about its current importance within the EU, policy areas to which it should pay particular attention, and whether it protected citizen's interests. Other queries focused on fears and expectations regarding the EU. Respondents were asked if they feared loss of power for smaller member states, increased drug trafficking, language acculturation, loss of national i\ndentity, transfer of jobs, more taxes, or other countries joining the EU. Respondents indicated whether the EU should become more active in areas of peace, agriculture, fishing, immigration, environmental protection, consumerism, research efforts, unemployment, crime prevention, European law, gender equality, and protection from non-European competition. With respect to building Europe, opinions were sought on the necessity of policies such as a single internal market, a common agricultural policy, a European social policy, one foreign policy, one army, one currency, one tax system, and an elected European government. Demographic and other background information provided includes respondent's age, sex, marital status, and left-right political self-placement as well as household income, the number of people residing in the home, and region of residence. Respondents aged 15-24 years were also surveyed on a variety of additional topics including the EU, elderly people, family planning, religion, foreigners, employment, activities, and organization memberships. The data regarding this topic are reported in EUROBAROMETER 47.2OVR: YOUNG EUROPEANS, APRIL-JUNE 1997 (ICPSR 2091)."}}]},{"typeName":"keyword","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"cancer"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"disease prevention"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"economic integration"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European Parliament"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"European unification"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"health attitudes"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"national interests"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"policy making"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"public opinion"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"quality of life"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"social change"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"women"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}},{"keywordValue":{"typeName":"keywordValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"womens health care"},"keywordVocabulary":{"typeName":"keywordVocabulary","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"thesaurus"}}]},{"typeName":"topicClassification","multiple":true,"typeClass":"compound","value":[{"topicClassValue":{"typeName":"topicClassValue","multiple":false,"typeClass":"primitive","value":"ICPSR XIV.C.3.a.
